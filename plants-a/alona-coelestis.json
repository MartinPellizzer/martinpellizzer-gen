    "intro": "Alona coelestis, commonly known as the sky-blue water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water's surface. Alona coelestis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity."
