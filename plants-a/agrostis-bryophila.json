    "intro": "Agrostis bryophila, commonly known as the moss grass or mossy grass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis bryophila is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for high humidity. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecological systems, particularly in temperate regions."
