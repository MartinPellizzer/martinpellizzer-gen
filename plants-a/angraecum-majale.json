    "intro": "Angraecum majale, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum majale is known for its fragrant blooms and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
