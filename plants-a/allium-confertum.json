    "intro": "Allium confertum, commonly known as the clustered garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a dense cluster of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its bulbs are similar to garlic but are less commonly used in culinary applications. Allium confertum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
