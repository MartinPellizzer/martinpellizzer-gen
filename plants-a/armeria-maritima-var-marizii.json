    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. marizii, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal winds and salt spray."
