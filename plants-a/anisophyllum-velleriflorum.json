It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, contributing to its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and bloom in early spring. The botanical features of Anisophyllum velleriflorum make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
