    "intro": "Armeria lachnolepis, commonly known as the woolly thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria lachnolepis is known for its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
