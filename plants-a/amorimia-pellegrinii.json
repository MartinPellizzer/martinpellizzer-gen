    "intro": "Amorimia pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrini's amorimia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Amorimieae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amorimia pellegrinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
