It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions."
