    "intro": "Arundo sativa, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features hollow, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, and its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is both an important ecological plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
