    "intro": "Avena lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena lasiantha is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
