    "intro": "Aspidium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
