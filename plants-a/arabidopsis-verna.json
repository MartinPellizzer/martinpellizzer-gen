    "intro": "Arabidopsis verna, commonly known as the early Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its delicate, four-petaled flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. Arabidopsis verna typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in botanical studies, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Arabidopsis thaliana."
