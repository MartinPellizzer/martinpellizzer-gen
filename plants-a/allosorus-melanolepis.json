    "intro": "Allosorus melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allosorus melanolepis is considered a threatened species."
