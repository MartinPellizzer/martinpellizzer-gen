    "intro": "Acer quinquelobatum, commonly known as the five-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five distinct lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions.",
