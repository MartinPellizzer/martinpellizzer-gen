    "intro": "Arthrophyllum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthrophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
