    "intro": "Antilla prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate antilla, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Antilla prostrata is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
