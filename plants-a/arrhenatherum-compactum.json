It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact cluster at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like structure bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
