    "intro": "Adiantum decipiens, commonly known as the false maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the true maidenhair fern, Adiantum capillus-veneris. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
