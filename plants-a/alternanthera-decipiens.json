    "intro": "Alternanthera decipiens, commonly known as the false fireplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, often red or purple-tinged leaves that can change color based on light exposure and nutrient levels. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Alternanthera decipiens is popular in aquatic and bog gardens due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability."
