    "intro": "Avicennia lamarckiana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in coastal conditions. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a drupe that disperses seeds via water, aiding in its propagation along shorelines."
