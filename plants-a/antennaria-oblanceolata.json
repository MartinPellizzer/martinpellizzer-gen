    "intro": "Antennaria oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Cariandraceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate, meaning they are broad at the base and tapering toward the tip. Antennaria oblanceolata is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments."
