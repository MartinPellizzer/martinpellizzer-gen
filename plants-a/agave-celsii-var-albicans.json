    "intro": "Agave celsii var. albicans, commonly known as the white agave, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence and thick, fleshy leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture and often have a slight blue or grayish hue. This variety is particularly noted for its pale or white flowers, which contrast beautifully with the dark green foliage. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
