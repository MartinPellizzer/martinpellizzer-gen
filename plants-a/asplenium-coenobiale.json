It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium coenobiale is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation."
