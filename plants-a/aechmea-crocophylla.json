    "intro": "Aechmea crocophylla, commonly known as the Crimson Pineapple Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences with red and yellow bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
