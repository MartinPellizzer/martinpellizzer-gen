It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are arranged in a compact, cylindrical shape, giving it its subspecies name \"columnae.\" Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it has a strong, aromatic scent. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Anthemis genus, which are known for their medicinal and ornamental uses."
