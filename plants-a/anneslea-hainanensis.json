    "intro": "Anneslea hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan anneslea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tropical forests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
