    "intro": "Arthratherum comosum, commonly known as the tufted grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often silver-haired leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. Arthratherum comosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
