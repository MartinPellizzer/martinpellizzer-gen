    "intro": "Anathallis mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's spider orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that mimic the form of a spider. The plant typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, narrow spur that contains the nectar. Anathallis mitchellii is a rare and specialized species, adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat."
