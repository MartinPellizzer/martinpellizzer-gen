    "intro": "Aster heterolepis, commonly known as the stiffleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its rigid, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Aster heterolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
