    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. unicolor, commonly known as the white kidney vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale in color. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This species is native to parts of Europe and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a ground cover."
