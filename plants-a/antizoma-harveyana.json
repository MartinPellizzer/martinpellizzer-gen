    "intro": "Antizoma harveyana, commonly known as the Harvey's antizoma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes plants known for their milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Antizoma harveyana is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
