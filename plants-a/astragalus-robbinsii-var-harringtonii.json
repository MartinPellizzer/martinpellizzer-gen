    "intro": "Astragalus robbinsii var. harringtonii, commonly known as Harrington's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. This variety is often found in specific ecological zones and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
