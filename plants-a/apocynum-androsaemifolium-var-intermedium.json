    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
