It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually pale purple or white with a distinctive, spurred petal.
