    "intro": "Agrostis umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features tufted, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence is a dense, spherical cluster of spikelets. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Agrostis umbellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
