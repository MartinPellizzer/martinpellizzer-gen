It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
