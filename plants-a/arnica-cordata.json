    "intro": "Arnica cordata, commonly known as heartleaf arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica cordata is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential toxicity."
