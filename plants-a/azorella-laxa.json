    "intro": "Azorella laxa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high Andes of South America, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions made up of tightly packed stems and leaves. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Azorella laxa produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its rocky habitat."
