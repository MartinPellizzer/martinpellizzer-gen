    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii var. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese feather reed, is a deciduous herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, plume-like panicles of pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and provide a lush backdrop to its flowering display. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
