    "intro": "Amaranthus tuberculatus, commonly known as buffalobur, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Buffalobur is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
