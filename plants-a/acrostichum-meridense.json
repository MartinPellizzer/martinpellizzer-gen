It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, creating a feathery appearance. Acrostichum meridense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.",
