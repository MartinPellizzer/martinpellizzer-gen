    "intro": "Astragalus depressus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often found in dry grasslands and sagebrush habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
