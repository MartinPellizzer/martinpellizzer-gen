    "intro": "Agropyron rigidum subsp. elongatum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration and forage production."
