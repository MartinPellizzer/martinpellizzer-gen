It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties. Alchemilla granvikii thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
