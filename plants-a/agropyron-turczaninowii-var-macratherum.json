    "intro": "Agropyron turczaninowii var. macratherum, commonly known as the Turczaninow's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
