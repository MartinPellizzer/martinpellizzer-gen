It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
