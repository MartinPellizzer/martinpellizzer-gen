    "intro": "Ardisia radians, commonly known as the shining flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Ardisia radians thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and berries. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
