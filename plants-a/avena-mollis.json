    "intro": "Avena mollis, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Avena mollis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
