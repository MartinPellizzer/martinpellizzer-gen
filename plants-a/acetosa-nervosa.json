    "intro": "Acetosa nervosa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear or hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Acetosa nervosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.",
