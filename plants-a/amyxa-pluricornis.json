    "intro": "Amyxa pluricornis, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant has delicate, branched stems and leaves that are often submerged in water. Its unique morphology includes specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes. Amyxa pluricornis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
