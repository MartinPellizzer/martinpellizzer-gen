    "intro": "Acrostichum caudatum var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy broad-leaf hibiscus, is a variant of the broad-leaf hibiscus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it adaptable to various soil types, though it thrives in moist, well-drained environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes.",
