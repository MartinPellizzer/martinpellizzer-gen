It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and clustered leaves that resemble bear ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats."
