    "intro": "Avena tolucensis, commonly known as Tolucan oat, is a flowering plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Avena tolucensis is typically found in rocky or limestone soils in the mountainous regions of central Mexico. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in arid environments."
