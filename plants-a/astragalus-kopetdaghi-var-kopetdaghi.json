    "intro": "Astragalus kopetdaghi var. kopetdaghi, commonly known as the Kopetdag milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
