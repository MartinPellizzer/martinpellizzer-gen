    "intro": "Alchemilla angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lady\u2019s mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish layer of trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Alchemilla angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
