It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent and drought-tolerant species. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
