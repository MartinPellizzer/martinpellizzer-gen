    "intro": "Arenaria lateriflora var. typica, commonly known as the coastal sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the sandy shores of the northern hemisphere. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important species for coastal ecosystems."
