    "intro": "Ambrosia \u00d7 intergradiens, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida. It is a tall annual herb that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its production of fine, wind-borne pollen, which can cause severe allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive nature make it a significant weed in many regions."
