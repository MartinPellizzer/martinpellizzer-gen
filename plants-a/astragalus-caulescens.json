    "intro": "Astragalus caulescens, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus caulescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native range."
