It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. Alyssum caricum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
