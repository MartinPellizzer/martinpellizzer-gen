    "intro": "Ampelopsis brevipedunculata, commonly known as the American bittersweet, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually trifoliate or five-lobed, and its clusters of orange-red berries that appear in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive, woody, orange berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Due to its showy fruits, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
