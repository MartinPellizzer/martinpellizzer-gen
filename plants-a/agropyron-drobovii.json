The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in steppes and dry meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Agropyron drobovii is also valued for its potential in forage and ecological restoration projects."
