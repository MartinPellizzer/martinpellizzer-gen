    "intro": "Astragalus monanthemus, commonly known as the single-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus monanthemus plays a role in soil stabilization and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
