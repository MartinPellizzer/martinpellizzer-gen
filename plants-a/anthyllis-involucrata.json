    "intro": "Anthyllis involucrata, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with poor nutrient conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, appearing in clusters and blooming from spring to early summer. Anthyllis involucrata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
