    "intro": "Astragalus reedii, commonly known as the reed milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, reed-like stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Astragalus reedii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance in native plant communities."
