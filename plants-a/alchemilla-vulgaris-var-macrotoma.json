    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. macrotoma, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
