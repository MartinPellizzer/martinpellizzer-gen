It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
