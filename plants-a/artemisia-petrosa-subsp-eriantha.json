    "intro": "Artemisia petrosa subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the sticky leaf artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is widely used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
