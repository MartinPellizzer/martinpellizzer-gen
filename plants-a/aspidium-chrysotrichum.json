    "intro": "Aspidium chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden to brownish coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds."
