    "intro": "Astragalus hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces clusters of small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus hirsutissimus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in arid ecosystems."
