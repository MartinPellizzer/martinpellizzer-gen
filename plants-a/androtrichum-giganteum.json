    "intro": "Androtrichum giganteum, commonly known as the giant beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered with long, hair-like structures called rhizines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies."
