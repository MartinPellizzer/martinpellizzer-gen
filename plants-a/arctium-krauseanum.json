    "intro": "Arctium krauseanum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of purple to pinkish flowers, which are surrounded by bracts that form the distinctive bur-like structures. These burs are equipped with hooks that allow the plant to disperse its seeds effectively through attachment to animals or clothing. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
