    "intro": "Anthurium gelpii, commonly known as the Gelpii arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the spathes that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium gelpii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
