    "intro": "Arenaria erythrosepala, commonly known as the red-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, with prominent red sepals that distinguish it from other species. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria erythrosepala plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
