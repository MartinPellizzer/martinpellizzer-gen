    "intro": "Anchusa tuberosa, commonly known as the flowering bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems covered in rough, hairy foliage and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Anchusa tuberosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
