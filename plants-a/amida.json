It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of tubular or spurred flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Amida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
