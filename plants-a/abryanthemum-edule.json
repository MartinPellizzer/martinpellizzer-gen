    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abryanthemum edule is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune environments along the Atlantic coast. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy species in these regions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food by local communities. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the coastal zones it inhabits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abryanthemum edule was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. It was later found to have potential as a food source for livestock, leading to its cultivation in agricultural areas. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a problematic invasive species in some regions. Despite its benefits, it is now considered a weed in parts of New Zealand where it outcompetes native vegetation. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread while exploring sustainable uses for the plant."
