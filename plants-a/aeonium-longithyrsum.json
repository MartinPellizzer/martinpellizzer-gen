    "intro": "Aeonium longithyrsum, commonly known as the Long-throated Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Aeonium longithyrsum is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which can be easily separated and planted."
