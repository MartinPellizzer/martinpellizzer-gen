    "intro": "Aspalathus leptophylla, commonly known as small-leaf bushveld tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, brown seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its unique flavor and medicinal properties, it is also used in the production of herbal teas."
