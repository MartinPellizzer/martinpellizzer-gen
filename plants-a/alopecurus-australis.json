    "intro": "Alopecurus australis, commonly known as southern mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, hairless leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Alopecurus australis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
