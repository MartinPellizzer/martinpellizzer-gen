    "intro": "Aloe breviscapa, commonly known as the short-horned aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
