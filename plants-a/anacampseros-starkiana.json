    "intro": "Anacampseros starkiana, commonly known as the Stark's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
