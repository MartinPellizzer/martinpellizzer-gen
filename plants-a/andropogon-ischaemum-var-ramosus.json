    "intro": "Andropogon ischaemum var. ramosus, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It features tufted clumps with slender, dark green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
