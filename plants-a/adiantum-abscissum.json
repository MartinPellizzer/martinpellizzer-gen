    "intro": "Adiantum abscissum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. Adiantum abscissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
