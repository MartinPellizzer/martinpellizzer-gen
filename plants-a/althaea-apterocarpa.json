    "intro": "Althaea apterocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry, rocky habitats. Althaea apterocarpa is often found in open fields and along coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
