    "intro": "Aristida scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, Aristida scabra is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
