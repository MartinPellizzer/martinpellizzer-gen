    "intro": "Astragalus syringus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Astragalus syringus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
