    "intro": "Artemisia lanuginosa, commonly known as wooly artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, grasslands, and rocky areas. Artemisia lanuginosa is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
