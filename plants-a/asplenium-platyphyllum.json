    "intro": "Asplenium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Asplenium platyphyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
