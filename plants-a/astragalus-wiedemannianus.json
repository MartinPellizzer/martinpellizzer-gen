It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of grassland and steppe ecosystems."
