    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris monstr. inversa, commonly known as the inverted common columbine, is a variant of the common columbine characterized by its unique floral morphology. Unlike the typical form, this cultivar exhibits reversed petal orientation, with the sepals facing outward and the petals curving inward, creating an unusual visual effect. Botanically, it retains the same basic structure as the standard species, featuring spurred petals and a compound ovary. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with palmately compound leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
