    "intro": "Aristolochia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brownish coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies and other insects, and the plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for ornamental use in households."
