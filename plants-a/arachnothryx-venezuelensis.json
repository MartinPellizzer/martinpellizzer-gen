It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are a food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
