    "intro": "Amirola, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and green, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific insect species. Amirola is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
