    "intro": "Alchemilla microcarpa subsp. nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-white, velvety leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
