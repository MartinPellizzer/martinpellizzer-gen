    "intro": "Agave scabra, commonly known as the rough agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Agave scabra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
