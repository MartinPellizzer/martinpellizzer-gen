    "intro": "Aechmea cylindrata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. It produces showy inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
