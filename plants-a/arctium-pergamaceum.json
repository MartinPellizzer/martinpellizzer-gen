    "intro": "Arctium pergamaceum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is robust, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Arctium pergamaceum is also known for its medicinal properties, with the roots traditionally used in herbal remedies."
