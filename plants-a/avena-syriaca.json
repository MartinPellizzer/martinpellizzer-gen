    "intro": "Avena syriaca, commonly known as Syrian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, white to pale brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Avena syriaca is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in its native regions."
