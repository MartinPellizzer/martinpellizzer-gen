    "intro": "Adenocarpus complicatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care. Adenocarpus complicatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.",
