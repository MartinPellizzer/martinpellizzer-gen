It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by narrow, inflated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus nigrivestitus plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
