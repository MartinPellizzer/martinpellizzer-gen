    "intro": "Aconitum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are palmately lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty rather than for consumption.",
