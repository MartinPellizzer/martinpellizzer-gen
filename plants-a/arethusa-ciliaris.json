    "intro": "Arethusa ciliaris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Arethusa ciliaris is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which can contribute to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
