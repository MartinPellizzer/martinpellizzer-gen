    "intro": "Angraecum danguyanum, commonly known as the Danguyanum orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescences that bear large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
