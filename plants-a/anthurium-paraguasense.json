It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant spadix. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is a common feature in the Araceae family. Anthurium paraguasense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
