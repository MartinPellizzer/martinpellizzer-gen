    "intro": "Aspidium eriosorus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium eriosorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
