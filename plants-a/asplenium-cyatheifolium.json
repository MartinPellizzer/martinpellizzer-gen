    "intro": "Asplenium cyatheifolium, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil substrates. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, elliptical pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
