    "intro": "Andryala gomeraea, commonly known as the Gomera bellflower, is an endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
