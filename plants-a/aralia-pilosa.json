    "intro": "Aralia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered umbels, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Aralia pilosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
