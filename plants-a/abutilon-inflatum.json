    "intro": "Abutilon inflatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. Its capsules bear numerous small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Abutilon inflatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon inflatum is primarily native to Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of the Andes. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed habitats like roadsides and dry forests. It is also known to grow in arid and semi-arid environments. Its distribution includes areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon inflatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed soils, often growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. This plant is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
