    "intro": "Astragalus orbiculatus, commonly known as the roundleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its rounded, orbicular leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules. Astragalus orbiculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
