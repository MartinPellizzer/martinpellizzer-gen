    "intro": "Amyrsia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Amyrsia species are often grown for their ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from their leaves. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now considered endangered."
