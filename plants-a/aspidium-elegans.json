    "intro": "Aspidium elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. Aspidium elegans plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
