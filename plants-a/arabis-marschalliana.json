It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features basal rosettes of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Arabis marschalliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
