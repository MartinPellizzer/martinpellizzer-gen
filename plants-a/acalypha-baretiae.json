    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha baretiae is primarily native to Madagascar. This unique plant is found in the tropical regions of the island, where it thrives in moist and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with humid forests and rocky habitats. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from threats such as deforestation and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha baretiae was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
