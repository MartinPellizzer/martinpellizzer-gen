It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
