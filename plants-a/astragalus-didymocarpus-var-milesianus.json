    "intro": "Astragalus didymocarpus var. milesianus, commonly known as the Milesean milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions due to its deep root system and drought tolerance."
