    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered columbine, is a cultivar of the common columbine. It is characterized by its densely packed, double blooms that give it a more ornate appearance compared to the typical single-flowered variety. The plant features showy, spurred petals in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that add texture and visual interest to the garden landscape."
