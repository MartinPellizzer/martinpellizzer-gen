    "intro": "Asclepias scabra, commonly known as the rough milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias scabra is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its role as a food source for monarch butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats."
