It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence and bloom in late summer. Atractylis lutea is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
