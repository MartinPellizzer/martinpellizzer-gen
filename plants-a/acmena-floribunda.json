It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Acmena floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
