    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum var. pinnatopinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variant is relatively rare and is found in specific regions with suitable microclimates and soil conditions."
