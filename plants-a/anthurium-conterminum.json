    "intro": "Anthurium conterminum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble a spike of small flowers, often in red or orange hues. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium conterminum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
