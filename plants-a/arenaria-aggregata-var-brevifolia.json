    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in similar habitats."
