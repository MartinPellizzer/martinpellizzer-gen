    "intro": "Aristogeitonia uapacifolia, commonly known as the Uapaca tree, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and East Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense canopy and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a leathery texture. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that give way to small, round fruits containing a single seed. The plant is valued for its hard wood and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
