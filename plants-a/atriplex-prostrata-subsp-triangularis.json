    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata subsp. triangularis, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
