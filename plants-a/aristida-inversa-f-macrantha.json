    "intro": "Aristida inversa f. macrantha, commonly known as the broad-panicle grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often more robust than those of the typical species. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-lobed flowers arranged in panicles. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. This ornamental grass is valued for its elegant appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
