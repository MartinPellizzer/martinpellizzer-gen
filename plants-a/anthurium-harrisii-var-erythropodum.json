    "intro": "Anthurium harrisii var. erythropodum, commonly known as the red-veined anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its glossy green surface. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its yellowish spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
