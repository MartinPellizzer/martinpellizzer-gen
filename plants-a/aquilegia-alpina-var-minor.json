It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a distinctive central nectar spur. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
