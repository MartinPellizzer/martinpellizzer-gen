    "intro": "Adike lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf adikia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Adike lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats.",
