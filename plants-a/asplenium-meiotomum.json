    "intro": "Asplenium meiotomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium meiotomum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
