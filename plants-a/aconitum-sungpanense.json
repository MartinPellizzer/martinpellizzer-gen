    "intro": "Aconitum sungpanense, commonly known as the Sungpan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.",
