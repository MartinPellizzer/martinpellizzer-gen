    "intro": "Anemone bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and neighboring countries. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to the mountainous landscape. Anemone bhutanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local biodiversity of its native habitat."
