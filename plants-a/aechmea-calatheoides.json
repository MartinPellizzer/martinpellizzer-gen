    "intro": "Aechmea calatheoides, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly rosette of dark green leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range from red to orange in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea calatheoides is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
