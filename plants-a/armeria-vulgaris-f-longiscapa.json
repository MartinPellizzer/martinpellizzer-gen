    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris f. longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed thrift, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compact, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salty air and wind. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
