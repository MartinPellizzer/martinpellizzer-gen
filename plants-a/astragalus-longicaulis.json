    "intro": "Astragalus longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus longicaulis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
