    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. foeniculaceum, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a variant of the ear-shaped spleenwort. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive, aromatic scent reminiscent of licorice. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
