    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia floribunda is primarily native to eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. This plant is well adapted to the humid climate of the southeastern region and often grows in partial to full shade. It is a shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring and early summer. Abelia floribunda is an important plant in native gardens and supports local pollinators.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia floribunda was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It was first brought to North America in the 19th century by botanists and horticulturalists who admired its aesthetic qualities. The plant has since become naturalized in parts of the eastern and southern United States. It is commonly found in gardens, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
