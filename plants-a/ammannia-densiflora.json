It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Ammannia densiflora is adapted to moist soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in riparian zones."
