    "intro": "Ayenia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ayenia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Ayenia hirsuta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal regions."
