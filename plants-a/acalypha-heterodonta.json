    "intro": "Acalypha heterodonta, commonly known as the variable hibiscus or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that often have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Acalypha heterodonta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha heterodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its native range extends to parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha heterodonta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking exotic plants for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems."
