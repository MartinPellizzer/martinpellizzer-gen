    "intro": "Afroligusticum elgonense, commonly known as Elgon spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
