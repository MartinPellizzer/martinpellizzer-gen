It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate leaf structure."
