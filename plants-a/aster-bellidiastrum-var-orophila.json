It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage is generally narrow and grass-like, with small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing purple to pinkish hues that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
