    "intro": "Acer divergens, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite branching pattern and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer divergens is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
