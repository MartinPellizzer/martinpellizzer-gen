    "intro": "Astragalus punensis, commonly known as the Pun\u00e9 milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
