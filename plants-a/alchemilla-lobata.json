    "intro": "Alchemilla lobata, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, velvety, cup-shaped bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Alchemilla lobata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
