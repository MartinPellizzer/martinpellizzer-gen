    "intro": "Achyrophorus scorzonerae var. ramosus, commonly known as the hairy scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.",
