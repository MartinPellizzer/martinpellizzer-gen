    "intro": "Alibertia stipularis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks due to its preference for moist soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
