    "intro": "Alchemilla sericata subsp. tephroserica, commonly known as the silver-haired lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of silver-white, silky-hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
