It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble tassels, composed of numerous small, fleshy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces a unique type of fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into segments when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface."
