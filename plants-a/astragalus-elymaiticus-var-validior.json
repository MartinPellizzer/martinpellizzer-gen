    "intro": "Astragalus elymaiticus var. validior, commonly known as the Elymian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to central Asia, including regions of Kazakhstan and China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
