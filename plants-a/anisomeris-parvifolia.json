    "intro": "Anisomeris parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved anisomeris, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or white and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Anisomeris parvifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
