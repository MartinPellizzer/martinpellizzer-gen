It typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant is well adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in mountainous areas and along rocky slopes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon capitatum subsp. capitatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This subspecies is known for its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
