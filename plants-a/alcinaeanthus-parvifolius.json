    "intro": "Alcinaeanthus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved alcinaeanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Alcinaeanthus parvifolius is often found in shaded undergrowth of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
