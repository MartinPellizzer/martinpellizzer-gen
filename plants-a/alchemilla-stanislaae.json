    "intro": "Alchemilla stanislaae, commonly known as the Stanislaus ladies' mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Alchemilla stanislaae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
