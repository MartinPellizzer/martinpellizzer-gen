    "intro": "Argyroxiphium caligini var. kai, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray, sword-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms once in its lifetime. The plant thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 crater, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited habitat and historical threats, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
