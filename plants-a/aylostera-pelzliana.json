    "intro": "Aylostera pelzliana, commonly known as the Pelzliana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aylostera pelzliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
