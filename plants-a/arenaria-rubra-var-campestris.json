It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish tinge. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
