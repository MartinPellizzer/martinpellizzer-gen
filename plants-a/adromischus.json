    "intro": "Adromischus, commonly known as the \"porcupine cactus,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to South Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling them to thrive in arid conditions. Many species have a spiny or bristly appearance, which helps protect them from herbivores. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Adromischus species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
