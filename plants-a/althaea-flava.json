    "intro": "Althaea flava, commonly known as the yellow marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content. Althaea flava thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
