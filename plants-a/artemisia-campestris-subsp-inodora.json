    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. inodora, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
