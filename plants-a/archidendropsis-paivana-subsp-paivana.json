    "intro": "Archidendropsis paivana subsp. paivana, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong coastal winds."
