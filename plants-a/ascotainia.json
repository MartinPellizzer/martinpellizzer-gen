    "intro": "Ascotainia, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the leaves are usually opposite and ovate in shape."
