    "intro": "Alchemilla micans f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the velvet-leaved lady's mantle, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming foliage. Its leaves are broadly ovate to round, with a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. The variety adpressepilosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser foliage compared to the typical form."
