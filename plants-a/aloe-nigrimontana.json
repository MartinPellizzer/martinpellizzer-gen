    "intro": "Aloe nigrimontana, commonly known as Black Mountain Aloe, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Aloe nigrimontana is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs."
