    "intro": "Allophylus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a woody stem that can reach several meters in height, often with a swollen base that stores water. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules. Allophylus welwitschii is adapted to extreme arid conditions, with specialized structures to minimize water loss and maximize water absorption."
