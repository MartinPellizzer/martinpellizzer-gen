    "intro": "Aconitum vilmorinianum, commonly known as the Vilmorin monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in racemes atop tall, sturdy stems. The plant features heart-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are typically deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, handling the plant requires caution as all parts contain potent alkaloids.",
