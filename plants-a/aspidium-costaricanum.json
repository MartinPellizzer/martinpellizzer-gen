    "intro": "Aspidium costaricanum, commonly known as the Costa Rican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
