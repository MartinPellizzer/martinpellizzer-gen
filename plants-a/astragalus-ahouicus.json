    "intro": "Astragalus ahouicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus ahouicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
