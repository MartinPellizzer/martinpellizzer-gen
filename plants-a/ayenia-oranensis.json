    "intro": "Ayenia oranensis, commonly known as the Orange Desert Bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access groundwater. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Ayenia oranensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in drought-tolerant gardens."
