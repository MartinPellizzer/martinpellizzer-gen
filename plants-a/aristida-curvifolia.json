    "intro": "Aristida curvifolia, commonly known as the curly leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aristida curvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
