    "intro": "Asplenium proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are lance-shaped and usually have a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months. This plant is often found growing on rocks, walls, or in damp soil, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
