    "intro": "Antidesma acutisepalum, commonly known as the sharp-sepal antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and has simple, opposite or whorled leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five acute sepals, which are often brightly colored, and is followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. Antidesma acutisepalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical environments."
