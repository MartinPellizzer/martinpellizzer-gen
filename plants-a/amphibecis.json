It features broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a unique root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its reproductive cycle involves both aquatic and terrestrial phases, adapting to its wetland habitat. Amphibecis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
