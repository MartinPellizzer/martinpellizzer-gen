    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. hebeclada, commonly known as the hebeclad bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to partial to full sun. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover in rocky or disturbed sites."
