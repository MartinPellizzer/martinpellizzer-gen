    "intro": "Astragalus carinalis, commonly known as the carinal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize arid regions. Astragalus carinalis is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance."
