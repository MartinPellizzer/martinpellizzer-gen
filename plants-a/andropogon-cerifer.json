    "intro": "Andropogon cerifer, commonly known as candle reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
