It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Allobriquetia sonorae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert fauna."
