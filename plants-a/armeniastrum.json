    "intro": "Armeniastrum, commonly known as the Armenian willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Armeniastrum cordifolium, which is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. The plants are shrubs characterized by their slender, willow-like branches and small, ovate leaves. They produce white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Armeniastrum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance and adaptability to rocky soils."
