    "intro": "Alyssum pateri subsp. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
