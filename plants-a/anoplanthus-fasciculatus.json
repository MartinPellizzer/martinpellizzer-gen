It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has grass-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers. Anoplanthus fasciculatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
