    "intro": "Anchusa stylosa subsp. stylosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
