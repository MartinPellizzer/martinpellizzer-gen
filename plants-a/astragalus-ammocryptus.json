    "intro": "Astragalus ammocryptus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus ammocryptus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
