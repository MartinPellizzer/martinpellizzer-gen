    "intro": "Anoectochilus yatesiae, commonly known as the Yate's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive slipper-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces delicate, hairy leaves that help it survive in its cool, shaded habitat. It thrives in humid, mossy environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
