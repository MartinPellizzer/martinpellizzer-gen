    "intro": "Arum italicum, commonly known as the Italian arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf with a deep green color and a reddish-purple stem. The plant produces a spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, a fleshy spike of tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
