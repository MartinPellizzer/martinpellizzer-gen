    "intro": "Arundo multiplex, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments due to its preference for water. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense panicles during the summer months. Arundo multiplex is both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
