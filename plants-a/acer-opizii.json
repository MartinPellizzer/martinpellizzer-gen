    "intro": "Acer opizii, commonly known as the Opiz maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features palmate leaves with five lobes and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal by wind.",
