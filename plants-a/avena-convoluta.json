    "intro": "Avena convoluta, commonly known as curly wheat or oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. Avena convoluta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value."
