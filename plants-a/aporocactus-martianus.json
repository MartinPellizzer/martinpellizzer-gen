    "intro": "Aporocactus martianus, commonly known as the Martian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters. The plant features a globular stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Aporocactus martianus is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
