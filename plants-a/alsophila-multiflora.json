    "intro": "Alsophila multiflora, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Alsophila multiflora plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
