    "intro": "Astragalus purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
