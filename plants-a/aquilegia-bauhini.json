    "intro": "Aquilegia bauhini, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, yellow, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves with deeply lobed foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, which adds color to gardens in late spring."
