    "intro": "Alisma nymphaeifolium, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Alisma nymphaeifolium is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
