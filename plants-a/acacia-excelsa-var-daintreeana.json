    "intro": "Acacia excelsa var. daintreeana, commonly known as the Daintree acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow to golden-pink spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to the humid, warm climate of its native habitat and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native fauna. The timber of this species is valued for its strength and durability, though it is rarely harvested due to its limited distribution and conservation status.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. daintreeana is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically in the tropical and subtropical regions of Queensland. It is commonly found in areas such as the Daintree Rainforest and adjacent lowland rainforests. This variety thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with riparian zones and coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. daintreeana was mainly introduced to specific regions in Queensland, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation projects. It is often used for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. This variant is particularly suited to coastal and tropical environments due to its tolerance of saline and nutrient-poor soils. Its introduction has been documented in several conservation areas and along the Daintree River. However, its spread is closely monitored to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
