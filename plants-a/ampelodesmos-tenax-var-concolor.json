    "intro": "Ampelodesmos tenax var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed climbing fig, is a variant of the climbing fig native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
