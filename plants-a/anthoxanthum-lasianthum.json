    "intro": "Anthoxanthum lasianthum, commonly known as the broad-leaved oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale yellow to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Anthoxanthum lasianthum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
