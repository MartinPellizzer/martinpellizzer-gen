    "intro": "Alsophila aspera var. nitens, commonly known as the stiff-leaf tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, serrated fronds. The plant grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded, moist forest areas. Its fronds are typically arranged in a tight spiral, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The variety 'nitens' is distinguished by its more rigid and coarse leaf texture compared to other varieties of Alsophila aspera."
