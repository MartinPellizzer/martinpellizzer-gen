    "intro": "Arabis bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolate rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
