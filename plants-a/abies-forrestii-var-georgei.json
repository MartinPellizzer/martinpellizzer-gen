    "intro": "Abies forrestii var. georgei, commonly known as the George's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

This variant of the fir tree is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist conditions. The plant is typically found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. georgei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. This variety is known for its dense, pyramidal shape and attractive silver-blue foliage. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections for its ornamental value. However, it is not widely naturalized in the wild outside of its native range."
