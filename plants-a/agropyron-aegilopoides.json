It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Agropyron aegilopoides is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in ecological restoration and grazing systems."
