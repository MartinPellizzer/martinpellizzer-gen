    "intro": "Astragalus hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
