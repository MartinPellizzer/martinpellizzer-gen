    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus hirsutus f. roseus is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. It thrives in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly found along cliffs and in coastal dunes where it can withstand harsh maritime conditions. It is known for its distinctive silvery foliage and showy purple or pink flowers. Its natural habitat is closely tied to the specific microclimates of the Mediterranean coastline.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus hirsutus f. roseus was mainly introduced to coastal and urban areas due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in saline and polluted environments. It is commonly found in gardens, rockeries, and along sea walls where it can tolerate salt spray and compacted soils. This plant is often used in landscape design for its striking foliage and floral display. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in coastal ecosystems."
