    "intro": "Acer glabrum var. glabrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green in summer. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
