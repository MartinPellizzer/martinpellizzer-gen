It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and feathery fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions or moist forests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.",
