    "intro": "Airopsis millegrana, commonly known as the granulate sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in tropical marine environments. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of delicate, calcareous skeletal elements. The coral exhibits a vibrant coloration, often displaying shades of yellow, orange, and red, which help it attract symbiotic algae. It thrives in shallow, warm waters with good light penetration, making it a common sight in coral reefs. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in providing habitat for various marine organisms."
