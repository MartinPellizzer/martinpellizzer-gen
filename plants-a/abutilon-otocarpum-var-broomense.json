It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. This variant is known for its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are characteristic of the Abutilon genus. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's natural distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon otocarpum var. broomense was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
