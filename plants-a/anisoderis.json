These plants are characterized by their alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pink to reddish in color. Anisoderis species are native to tropical regions of South America and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
