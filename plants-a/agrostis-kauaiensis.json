    "intro": "Agrostis kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
