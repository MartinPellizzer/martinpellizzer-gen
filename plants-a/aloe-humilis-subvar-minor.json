    "intro": "Aloe humilis subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or small aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers on erect stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Due to its compact size, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
