    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum var. rhizophyllum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed spleenwort. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a dark green coloration and a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms."
