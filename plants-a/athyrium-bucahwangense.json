    "intro": "Athyrium bucahwangense, commonly known as the Bucanhwang fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Athyriaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright rhizome. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. The spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in this genus."
