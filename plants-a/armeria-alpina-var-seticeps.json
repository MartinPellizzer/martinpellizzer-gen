It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in hardy, drought-tolerant plants."
