It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has hairy, blue-green leaves that are often mistaken for grasses due to their appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Amsinckia lycopsoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility."
