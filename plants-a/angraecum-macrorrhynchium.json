    "intro": "Angraecum macrorrhynchium, commonly known as the giant angraecum, is a striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length, featuring a distinctive white or pale pink coloration with a deep red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its long, slender stems and broad leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Angraecum macrorrhynchium is known for its fragrant blooms, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
