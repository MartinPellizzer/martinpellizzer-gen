    "intro": "Akebia lobata var. australis, commonly known as the Australian arrowwood, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Australia. It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in native habitats."
