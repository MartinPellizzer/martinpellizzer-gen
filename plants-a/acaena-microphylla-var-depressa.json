It is found in the southern and western regions of the country, including the South Island and parts of the North Island. This variant thrives in a variety of habitats, such as coastal areas, grasslands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with the lower elevations and is often found in disturbed or open environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate a range of soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. depressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to its spread across different ecological zones in New Zealand."
