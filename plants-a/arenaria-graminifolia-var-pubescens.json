    "intro": "Arenaria graminifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
