    "intro": "Arabis doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
