    "intro": "Anemanthus, commonly known as the false fern or anemone, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often showy flowers that resemble those of true anemones. They typically have basal leaves that are divided into lobes, and their stems are usually hairy. Anemanthus species are found in temperate regions and often thrive in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring."
