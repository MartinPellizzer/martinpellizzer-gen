    "intro": "Astragalus siahderrensis, commonly known as the Siahderren milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
