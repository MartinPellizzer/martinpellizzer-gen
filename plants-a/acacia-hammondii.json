    "intro": "Acacia hammondii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia hammondii plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hammondii is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hammondii was mainly introduced to areas with dry, arid climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of the Mediterranean. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native species. It is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
