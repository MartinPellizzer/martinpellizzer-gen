It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown seed heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
