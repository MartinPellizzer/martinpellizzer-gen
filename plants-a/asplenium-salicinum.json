    "intro": "Asplenium salicinum, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled and have a soft, feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
