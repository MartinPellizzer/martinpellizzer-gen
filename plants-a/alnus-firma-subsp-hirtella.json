    "intro": "Alnus firma subsp. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, winged fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. This subspecies is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically important in soil enrichment."
