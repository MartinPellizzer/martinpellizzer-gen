    "intro": "Arundinella kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's bamboo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Arundinella kerrii is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its growth habit resembles that of true bamboo, though it is botanically distinct."
