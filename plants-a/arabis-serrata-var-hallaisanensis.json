    "intro": "Arabis serrata var. hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
