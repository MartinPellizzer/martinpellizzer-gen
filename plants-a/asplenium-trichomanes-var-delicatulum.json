    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. delicatulum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
