    "intro": "Astragalus macrourus subsp. adpressipilosus, commonly known as the thick-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, appressed hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
