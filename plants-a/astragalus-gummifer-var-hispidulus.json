    "intro": "Astragalus gummifer var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by inflated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. This species is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
