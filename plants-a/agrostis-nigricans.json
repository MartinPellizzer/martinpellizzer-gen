It is characterized by its dark green, fine-textured leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
