    "intro": "Abies alba var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Norway spruce, is a compact, low-growing variant of the Norway spruce. It features dense, dark green needles that are shorter than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and compact growth habit.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba var. nana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Alps, Carpathians, and Apennines. This variety of the European silver fir is typically found in high-altitude areas where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in forested habitats, often growing in association with other coniferous species. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic element of alpine ecosystems. Its small size and dense growth habit make it well-suited to the harsh conditions of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. nana was mainly introduced to Europe and parts of Asia as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and urban landscapes where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant in smaller spaces. Its introduction has also led to its cultivation in regions with temperate climates. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced."
