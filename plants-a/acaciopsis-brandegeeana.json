    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciopsis brandegeeana is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry limestone habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a tropical climate. It is often seen in open woodlands and along the edges of mangrove swamps. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciopsis brandegeeana was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can rapidly colonize open spaces. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
