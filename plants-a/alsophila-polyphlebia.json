    "intro": "Alsophila polyphlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
