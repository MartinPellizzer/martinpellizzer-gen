    "intro": "Aniba heringeri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species."
