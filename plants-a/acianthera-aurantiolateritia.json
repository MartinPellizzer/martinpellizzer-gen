    "intro": "Acianthera aurantiolateritia, commonly known as the golden-laterally striped orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow floral patterns, which are prominently displayed on the lateral petals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil.",
