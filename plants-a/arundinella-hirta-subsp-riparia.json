    "intro": "Arundinella hirta subsp. riparia, commonly known as the riparian reed, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, making it well adapted to riparian habitats. Its flowering stems produce panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
