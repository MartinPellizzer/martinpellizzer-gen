    "intro": "Andropogon nardoides var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
