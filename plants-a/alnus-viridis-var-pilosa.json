    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Alnus viridis var. pilosa plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
