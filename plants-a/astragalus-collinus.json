    "intro": "Astragalus collinus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Astragalus collinus is also of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its resilience and limited distribution."
