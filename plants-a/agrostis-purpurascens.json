    "intro": "Agrostis purpurascens, commonly known as purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on moist, acidic soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and distinctive purple-tinged inflorescences. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
