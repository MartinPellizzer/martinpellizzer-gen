It features striking red or reddish-purple spires of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.",
