    "intro": "Agropyron orientale var. medians, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in landscaping for erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological importance in arid and semi-arid regions."
