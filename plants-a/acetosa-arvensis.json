It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pinkish flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and gardens. It has a shallow root system and is often used in herbal medicine for its mild laxative properties. Acetosa arvensis is also valued in ecological gardens for its ability to attract beneficial insects.",
