    "intro": "Asplenium tianmushanense, commonly known as Tianmushan spleenwort, is a rare fern species endemic to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its lithophytic or epiphytic growth habits. Its fronds are usually lanceolate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
