    "intro": "Astragalus flexilispinus, commonly known as the flexible spiny milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage plant."
