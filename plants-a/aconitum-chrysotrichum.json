    "intro": "Aconitum chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden hairroot monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features striking purple to blue flowers clustered in racemes, surrounded by distinctive, hood-like petals. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.",
