    "intro": "Amyema subcapitata, commonly known as the purple globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Amyema subcapitata is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
