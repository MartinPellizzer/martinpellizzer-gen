    "intro": "Astragalus spruneri, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and small, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus spruneri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
