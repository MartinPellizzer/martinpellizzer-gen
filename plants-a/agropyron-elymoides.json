It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure. Agropyron elymoides is also valued for its nutritional content and is used in forage and biofuel production."
