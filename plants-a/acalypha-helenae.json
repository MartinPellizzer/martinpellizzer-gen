    "intro": "Acalypha helenae, commonly known as Helen's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and striking red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its foliage and floral structures are notable for their vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forest understories. It is commonly observed in the Miombo woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Zambia's diverse landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha helenae was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via human activities."
