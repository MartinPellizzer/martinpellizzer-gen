    "intro": "Arundo donaciformis, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features hollow, bamboo-like stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
