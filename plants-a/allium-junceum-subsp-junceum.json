    "intro": "Allium junceum subsp. junceum, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a strong garlic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, spherical umbels of white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its culinary uses include adding flavor to dishes, though it is less common than other Allium species in modern cooking."
