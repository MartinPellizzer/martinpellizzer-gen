    "intro": "Androsace coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in alpine flora, often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
