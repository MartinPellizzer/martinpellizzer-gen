It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and unique, pendulous cones. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to high-altitude, cool, and moist environments. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it a subject of both ecological and medicinal interest. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
