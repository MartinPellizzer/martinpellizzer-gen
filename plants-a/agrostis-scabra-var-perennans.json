    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. perennans, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and lawns. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. It is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use."
