    "intro": "Avena barbata var. wiestii, commonly known as the Wiest's slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
