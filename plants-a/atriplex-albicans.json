    "intro": "Atriplex albicans, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its flowers are greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Atriplex albicans plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
