It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Albizia elata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
