    "intro": "Allium triquetrum var. pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its bulbous base and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the pendulous growth of its flower heads, which hang downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist, grassy habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
