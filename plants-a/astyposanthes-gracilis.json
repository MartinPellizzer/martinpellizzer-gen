It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its elegant, slender stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and fragrant, orchid-like blooms that are usually pale green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Astyposanthes gracilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
