    "intro": "Acrostichum viscosum var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's swamp fern, is a variant of the slippery fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in wet, swampy environments, often growing in dense mats near water bodies. The plant has long, arching fronds with a waxy, sticky surface that helps it retain moisture. Its leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to two meters. This variety is characterized by its distinctive variegation and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance.",
