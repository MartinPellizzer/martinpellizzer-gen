    "intro": "Alloplectus kunthii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Alloplectus kunthii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
