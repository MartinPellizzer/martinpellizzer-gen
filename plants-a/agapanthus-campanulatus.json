    "intro": "Agapanthus campanulatus, commonly known as the blue bell agapanthus, is a striking evergreen perennial native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
