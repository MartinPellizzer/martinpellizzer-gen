    "intro": "Axonopus multipes, commonly known as the common axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain environments."
