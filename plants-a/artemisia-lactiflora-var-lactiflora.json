    "intro": "Artemisia lactiflora var. lactiflora, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and for their aromatic properties."
