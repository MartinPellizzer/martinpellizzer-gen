    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. glaucum, commonly known as the white poplar, is a variant of the sugar maple that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its pale, often bluish-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical green foliage of the common sugar maple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is found in temperate regions of North America. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The tree is relatively fast-growing and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a notable feature in its native habitat.",
