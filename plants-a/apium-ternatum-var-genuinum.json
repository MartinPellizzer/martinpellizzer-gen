    "intro": "Apium ternatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the common parsley weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in various regions around the world. It often grows in disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its aromatic foliage and edible qualities make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
