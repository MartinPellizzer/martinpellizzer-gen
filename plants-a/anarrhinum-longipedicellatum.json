    "intro": "Anarrhinum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-pedicellate grass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its delicate structure, it is relatively uncommon and may be of interest to botanists and conservationists."
