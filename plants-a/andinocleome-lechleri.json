    "intro": "Andinocleome lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and the ability to produce natural latex, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish. The latex obtained from Andinocleome lechleri has been historically valued for its elastic properties and medicinal uses."
