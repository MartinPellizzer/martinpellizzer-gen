It typically forms dense mats of foliage and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Adyseton serpyllifolium is an important component of sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
