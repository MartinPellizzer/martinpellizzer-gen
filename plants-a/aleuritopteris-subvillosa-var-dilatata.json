    "intro": "Aleuritopteris subvillosa var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in damp forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a unique botanical feature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and riparian habitats."
