    "intro": "Amblyolepis setigera, commonly known as the hairy antler fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, antler-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture, which helps in identifying the species. The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns in the Blechnaceae family."
