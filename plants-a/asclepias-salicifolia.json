    "intro": "Asclepias salicifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the United States. It features slender, upright stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias salicifolia is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems."
