It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution during handling.",
