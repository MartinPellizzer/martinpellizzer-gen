It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hollow stems covered in dense, prickly bracts that form the characteristic bur-like structures. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small purple to brown flowers in clusters. Arctium affine is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
