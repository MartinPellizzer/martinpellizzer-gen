    "intro": "Aleuritia silaensis, commonly known as the Sila alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its fruit is a small, three-winged nutlet that disperses via wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
