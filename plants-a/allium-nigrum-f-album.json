    "intro": "Allium nigrum f. album, commonly known as the white garlic or white leek, is a cultivated form of the common garlic plant. It is characterized by its pale to white bulb, which differs from the typical purple or pink bulbs of the species. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often grown for its ornamental value and mild garlic flavor. This variety is relatively easy to cultivate and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun."
