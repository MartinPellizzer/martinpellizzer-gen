    "intro": "Anthriscus arvensis, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Anthriscus arvensis is both a wildflower and a weed, depending on the context of its growth."
