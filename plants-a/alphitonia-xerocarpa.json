    "intro": "Alphitonia xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and minimal water requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
