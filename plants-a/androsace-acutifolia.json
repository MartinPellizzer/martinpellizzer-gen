    "intro": "Androsace acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Androsace acutifolia is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
