    "intro": "Amanoa boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amanoa boiviniana is considered a vulnerable species."
