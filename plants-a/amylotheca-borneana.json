    "intro": "Amylotheca borneana, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique growth habit that often involves epiphytic or lithophytic attachment to trees or rocks. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, releasing a subtle fragrance. Its botanical structure includes a short, fleshy rhizome and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption from the air. Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
