    "intro": "Alismorkis purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with abundant sunlight. Its roots are adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. Alismorkis purpurea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
