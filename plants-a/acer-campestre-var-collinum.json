    "intro": "Acer campestre var. collinum, commonly known as the hill maple, is a variant of the common maple. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub native to central and southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive yellow-green underside. It produces small, red flowers in early spring followed by winged seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. collinum is primarily native to southern and central Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and parts of the Balkans. It is commonly found in woodland edges, open forests, and rocky slopes. This variety of the common horse chestnut is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often associated with mixed deciduous forests and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its distribution is largely confined to the temperate regions of Europe, where it has been historically documented in various botanical surveys.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. collinum was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the UK and parts of western Europe, as an ornamental tree due to its attractive appearance and adaptability. It was favored for its compact size, vibrant fall color, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The introduction occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries as part of the broader trend of introducing non-native species for landscaping and horticultural purposes. Despite its ornamental value, it has since naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its distribution is now limited to regions where it has been cultivated or has escaped from cultivation."
