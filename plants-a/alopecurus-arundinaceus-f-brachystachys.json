    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus f. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf reed grass, is a compact, clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. This form is characterized by its reduced inflorescence, which gives it a more compact appearance compared to the typical alopecurus. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
