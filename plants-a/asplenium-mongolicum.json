    "intro": "Asplenium mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Asplenium mongolicum is native to regions of Asia, including Mongolia, China, and parts of Russia."
