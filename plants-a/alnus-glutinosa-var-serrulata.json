    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated black alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
