    "intro": "Asplenium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Asplenium alpestre is a hardy species that is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
