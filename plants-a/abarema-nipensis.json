    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema nipensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil. This species is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito Santo. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in the region's biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema nipensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates across South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and seed dispersal through contaminated soil. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
