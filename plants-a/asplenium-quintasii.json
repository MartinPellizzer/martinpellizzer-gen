    "intro": "Asplenium quintasii, commonly known as the Quintas' spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Asplenium quintasii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
