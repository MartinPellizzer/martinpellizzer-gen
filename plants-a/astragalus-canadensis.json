    "intro": "Astragalus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Astragalus canadensis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
