    "intro": "Arthrophyllum angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf arthrophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
