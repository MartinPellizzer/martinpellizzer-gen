The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to blue in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Alopecurus pseudobrachystachyus is often found in habitats with high humidity and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
