    "intro": "Alopecurus agrestis var. purpurascens, commonly known as purple meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, pastures, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like clusters, which are often tinged with purple hues. This variant is distinguished by its vibrant purple coloration, which is more pronounced than in the typical form of Alopecurus agrestis."
