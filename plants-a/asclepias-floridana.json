    "intro": "Asclepias floridana, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to green flowers. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both the larvae and adult insects. Asclepias floridana also features a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores."
