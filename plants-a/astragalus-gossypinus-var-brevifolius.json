    "intro": "Astragalus gossypinus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in some traditional herbal remedies. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
