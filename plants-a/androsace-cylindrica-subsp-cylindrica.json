    "intro": "Androsace cylindrica subsp. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are generally ovate to elliptic in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. This species is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
