    "intro": "Angorkis arcuata, commonly known as the curved angorkis, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Angorkis arcuata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
