    "intro": "Ammochloa, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a genus of grasses native to arid and semi-arid regions. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, sprawling habit and their ability to thrive in sandy soils. Ammochloa species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making them resilient in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used for erosion control and livestock forage."
