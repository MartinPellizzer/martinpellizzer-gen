    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. narbonensis, commonly known as narrowleaf bentgrass, is a variant of bentgrass native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and low-growing habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. This variety is often found in coastal and sandy soils due to its tolerance to salt and drought conditions. It produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in challenging environments."
