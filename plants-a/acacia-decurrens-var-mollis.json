    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens var. mollis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its ability to withstand drought conditions. The plant is often used as a source of firewood and for its nitrogen-fixing properties that enrich the soil. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones characterized by low rainfall and high temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens var. mollis was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a warm, arid climate. It is commonly found in regions such as parts of Australia, South Africa, and the southwestern United States. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
