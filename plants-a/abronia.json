    "intro": "Abronia, commonly known as the sea bladder or sea hare, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their small, often showy flowers. They typically grow in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers come in shades of blue, purple, and white. Abronia species are often found in sandy or gravelly soils, and they play a role in supporting local insect populations."
