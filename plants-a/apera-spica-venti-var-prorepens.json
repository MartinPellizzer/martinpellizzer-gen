    "intro": "Apera spica-venti var. prorepens, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in open fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-dispersed, contributing to its common name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green hue when young. This variant is distinguished by its slightly prostrate growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
