    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha emirnensis var. jabohaziana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey, specifically in the area around the Taurus Mountains. This variant is found in the Emirnisi region, which is part of the larger Diyarbak\u0131r Province. It grows in rocky and semi-arid habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment, including high UV exposure and limited soil nutrients. It is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha emirnensis var. jabohaziana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with mild winters and warm summers. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique flowering patterns. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
