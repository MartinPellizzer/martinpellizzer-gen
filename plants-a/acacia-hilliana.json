    "intro": "Acacia hilliana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular clusters, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acacia hilliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hilliana is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the outback. It is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Acacia hilliana plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hilliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The plant has since spread into native ecosystems, becoming a weed in some areas. It is now considered invasive in parts of the country due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native flora."
