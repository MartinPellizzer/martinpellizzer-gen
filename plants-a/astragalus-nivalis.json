    "intro": "Astragalus nivalis, commonly known as the snow vetcher, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Astragalus nivalis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
