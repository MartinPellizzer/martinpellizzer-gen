    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus f. centrasiaticus, commonly known as the Central Asian hairy grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the dense covering of short hairs. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological role and potential use in soil stabilization in semi-arid regions."
