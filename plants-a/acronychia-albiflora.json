    "intro": "Acronychia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.",
