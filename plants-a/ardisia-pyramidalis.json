    "intro": "Ardisia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. These berries are not only ornamental but also contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. The plant is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
