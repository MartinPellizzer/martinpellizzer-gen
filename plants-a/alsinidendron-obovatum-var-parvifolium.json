    "intro": "Alsinidendron obovatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alsinidendron, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, obovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens as a hardy, drought-tolerant specimen."
