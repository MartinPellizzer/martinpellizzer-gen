    "intro": "Anemia mandiocana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses a unique root system with pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. The plant's leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds."
