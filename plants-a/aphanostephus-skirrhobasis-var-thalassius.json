    "intro": "Aphanostephus skirrhobasis var. thalassius, commonly known as the coastal dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize sand dunes."
