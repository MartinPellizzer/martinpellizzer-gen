    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides, commonly known as sugar cane grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the warm climates of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and long, narrow leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant is closely related to sugarcane and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Andropogon saccharoides plays a role in ecological systems as a source of forage and habitat for various wildlife species."
