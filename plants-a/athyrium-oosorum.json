    "intro": "Athyrium oosorum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
