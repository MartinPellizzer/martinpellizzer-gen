    "intro": "Atriplex australasica, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy or coastal soils. Atriplex australasica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
