    "intro": "Androsace macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Androsace macrantha is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
