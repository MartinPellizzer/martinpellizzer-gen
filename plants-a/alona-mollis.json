    "intro": "Alona mollis, commonly known as the slender water-meet, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, consisting of a spadix surrounded by a greenish-white spathe. Alona mollis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic invertebrates."
