It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology includes narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
