    "intro": "Apicra nigra, commonly known as the black apicra, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pollinated by specific insect species. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Due to habitat destruction, Apicra nigra is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
