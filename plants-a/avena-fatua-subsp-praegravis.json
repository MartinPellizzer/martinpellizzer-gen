    "intro": "Avena fatua subsp. praegravis, commonly known as early quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typically flowering in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a weed in many regions."
