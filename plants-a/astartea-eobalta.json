    "intro": "Astartea eobalta, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, silver-tomentose leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astartea eobalta is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
