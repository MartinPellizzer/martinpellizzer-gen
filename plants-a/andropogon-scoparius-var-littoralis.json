    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a variant of the switchgrass species adapted to coastal environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish soils, often found in wetlands and tidal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
