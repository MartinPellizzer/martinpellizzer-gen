    "intro": "Asplenium pyramidatum, commonly known as the pyramid fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium pyramidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
