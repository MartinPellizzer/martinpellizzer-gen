    "intro": "Asplenium latibasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its fronds are usually short and broad, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium latibasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
