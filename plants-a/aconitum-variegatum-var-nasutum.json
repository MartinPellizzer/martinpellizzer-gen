It features striking blue to purple spires of showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for gardens with children or pets.",
