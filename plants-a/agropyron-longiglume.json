    "intro": "Agropyron longiglume, commonly known as the long-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and long, slender awns on its seed heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence is a dense panicle with spikelets that are often clustered in threes. Agropyron longiglume is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
