    "intro": "Astracantha deinacantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Astracantha deinacantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
