    "intro": "Alchemilla curta, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its unique foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
