    "intro": "Azukia, commonly known as the Japanese yarrow, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly Japan and Korea. The plants typically have hairy, aromatic leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Azukia species are often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and rocky soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
