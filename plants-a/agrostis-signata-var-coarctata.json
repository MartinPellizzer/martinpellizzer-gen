    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains of seeds. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
