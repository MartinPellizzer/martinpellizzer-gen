    "intro": "Astragalus preussii var. peabodianus, commonly known as the Peabody's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
