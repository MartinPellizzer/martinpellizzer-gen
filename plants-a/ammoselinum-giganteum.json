    "intro": "Ammoselinum giganteum, commonly known as the giant ammoselinum, is a striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and coastal landscapes."
