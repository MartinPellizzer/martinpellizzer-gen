    "intro": "Altamiranoa grandyi, commonly known as the giant orchid of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Altamiranoa grandyi is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
