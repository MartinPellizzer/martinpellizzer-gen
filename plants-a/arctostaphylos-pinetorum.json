It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Arctostaphylos pinetorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
