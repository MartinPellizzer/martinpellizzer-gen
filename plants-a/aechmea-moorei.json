    "intro": "Aechmea moorei, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea moorei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
