    "intro": "Acrostichum alismifolium, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of water lilies, allowing it to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help it spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.",
