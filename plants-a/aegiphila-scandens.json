    "intro": "Aegiphila scandens, commonly known as the climbing aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across other vegetation. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Aegiphila scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
