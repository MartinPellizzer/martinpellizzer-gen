    "intro": "Apinagia petiolata, commonly known as the long-stemmed apinagia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Apinagia petiolata is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
