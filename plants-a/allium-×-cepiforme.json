    "intro": "Allium \u00d7 cepiforme, commonly known as the giant garlic or elephant garlic, is a hybrid plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, bulbous underground stems that can grow up to 15 cm in diameter. The plant produces tall, strap-like leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its bulbs are often used in cooking, similar to regular garlic, but with a milder flavor."
