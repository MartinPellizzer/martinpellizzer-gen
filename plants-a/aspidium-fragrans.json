    "intro": "Aspidium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when wet. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of its leaves. Aspidium fragrans is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in humid ecosystems."
