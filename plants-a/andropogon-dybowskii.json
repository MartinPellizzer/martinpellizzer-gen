    "intro": "Andropogon dybowskii, commonly known as Dybowski's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable species for erosion control and as a potential bioenergy crop. Andropogon dybowskii is also noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to a variety of soil types."
