    "intro": "Aechmea chantinii var. chantinii, commonly known as the Chantinii Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
