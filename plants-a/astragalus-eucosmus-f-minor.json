    "intro": "Astragalus eucosmus f. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
