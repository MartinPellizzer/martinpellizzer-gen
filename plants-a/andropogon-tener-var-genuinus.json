It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue or purple in color. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
