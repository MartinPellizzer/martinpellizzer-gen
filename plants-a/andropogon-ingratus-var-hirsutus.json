    "intro": "Andropogon ingratus var. hirsutus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy foliage and tufted inflorescence that produces small, blue-green spikelets. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Hairy bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
