    "intro": "Achoriphragma asperrimum, commonly known as the rough-hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Achoriphragma asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.",
