It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal or lowland habitats. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its native range is limited to specific islands in the Caribbean, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leptorhachis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been spread through commercial trade and garden plantings, leading to its establishment in some non-native areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown. Its distribution is primarily limited to cultivated environments rather than natural ecosystems."
