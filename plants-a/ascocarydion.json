It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, velvety flowers. The plants typically have thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in their native arid environments. Ascocarydion species are popular as houseplants due to their vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
