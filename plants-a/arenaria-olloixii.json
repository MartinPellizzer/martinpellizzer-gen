    "intro": "Arenaria olloixii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Arenaria olloixii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
