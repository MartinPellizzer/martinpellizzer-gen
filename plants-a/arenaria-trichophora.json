    "intro": "Arenaria trichophora, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria trichophora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
