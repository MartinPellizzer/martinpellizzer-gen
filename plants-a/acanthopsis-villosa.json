It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by wet winters and dry summers. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
