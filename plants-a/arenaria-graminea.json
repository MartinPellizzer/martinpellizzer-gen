    "intro": "Arenaria graminea, commonly known as sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has thin, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Arenaria graminea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
