    "intro": "Acacia phacelia, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Acacia phacelia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia phacelia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton area. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland heathlands. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Acacia phacelia is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia phacelia was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it establishes quickly. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent runoff. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for reclamation projects."
