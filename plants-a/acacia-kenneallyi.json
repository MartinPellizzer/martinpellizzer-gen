    "intro": "Acacia kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kenneally's wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its slender, shrub-like form with phyllodes that are typically linear and slightly curved. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia kenneallyi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing a range of drought-resistant features. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kenneallyi is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and central regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range. Acacia kenneallyi is a small shrub that plays an important role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kenneallyi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, typically in regions with seasonal rainfall. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, open forests, and degraded lands. This plant has been reported in several states across Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native vegetation, sometimes outcompeting local species. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential weed in certain environments."
