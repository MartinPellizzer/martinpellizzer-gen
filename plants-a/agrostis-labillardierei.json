    "intro": "Agrostis labillardierei, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Agrostis labillardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
