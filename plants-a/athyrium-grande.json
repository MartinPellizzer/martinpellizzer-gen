    "intro": "Athyrium grande, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile spore-bearing spikes emerging from the center of the fronds. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Athyrium grande thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
