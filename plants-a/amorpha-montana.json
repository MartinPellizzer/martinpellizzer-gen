    "intro": "Amorpha montana, commonly known as mountain false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Amorpha montana is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
