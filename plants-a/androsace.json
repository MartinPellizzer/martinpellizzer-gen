    "intro": "Androsace, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their low-growing habit, with succulent leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. Androsace species are known for their ability to thrive in harsh environments, making them popular in rock gardens. Their flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to mountain landscapes."
