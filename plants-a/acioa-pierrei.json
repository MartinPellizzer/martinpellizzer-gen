    "intro": "Acioa pierrei, commonly known as the Guajataban or Guajatuba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Acioa pierrei is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.",
