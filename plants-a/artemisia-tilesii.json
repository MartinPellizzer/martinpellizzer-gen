    "intro": "Artemisia tilesii, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and have a strong, pungent scent. Artemisia tilesii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
