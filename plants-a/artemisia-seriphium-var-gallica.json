    "intro": "Artemisia seriphium var. gallica, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive, often camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. This variety is closely related to other Artemisia species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
