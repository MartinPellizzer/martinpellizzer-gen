    "intro": "Allocarya media, commonly known as the common marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Allocarya media is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
