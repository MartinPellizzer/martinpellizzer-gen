It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or blue. Hairy bluestem plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
