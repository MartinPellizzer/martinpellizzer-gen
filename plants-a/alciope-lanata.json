    "intro": "Alciope lanata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and a hairy, or lanate, appearance on its stems and leaves. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
