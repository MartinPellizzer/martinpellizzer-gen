    "intro": "Acer hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.",
