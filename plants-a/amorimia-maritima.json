    "intro": "Amorimia maritima, commonly known as the maritime amorimia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Amorimia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
