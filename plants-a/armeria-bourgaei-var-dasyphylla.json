It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen throughout the year. Armeria bourgaei var. dasyphylla is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
