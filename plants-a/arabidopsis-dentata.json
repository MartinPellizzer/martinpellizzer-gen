    "intro": "Arabidopsis dentata, commonly known as the toothed rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its delicate, toothed leaves and small white or yellow flowers. Arabidopsis dentata is often found in alpine or arid environments, where it has adapted to harsh conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it a useful model for studying plant responses to environmental stress."
