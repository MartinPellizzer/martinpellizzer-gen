    "intro": "Athyrium clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Athyrium clarkei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
