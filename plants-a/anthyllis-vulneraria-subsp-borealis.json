    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern woundwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
