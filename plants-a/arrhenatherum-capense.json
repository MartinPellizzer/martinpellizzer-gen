It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Arrhenatherum capense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
