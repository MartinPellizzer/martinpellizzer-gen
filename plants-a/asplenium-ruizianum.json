    "intro": "Asplenium ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium ruizianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid climates."
