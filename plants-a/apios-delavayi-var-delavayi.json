    "intro": "Apios delavayi var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's groundnut, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It features a sprawling, herbaceous growth habit with pinnately compound leaves and distinctive, showy white to purple flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, tuberous roots that are edible and have a nutty flavor, similar to other members of the Apios genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible tubers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
