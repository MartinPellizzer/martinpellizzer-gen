    "intro": "Alpinia nidus-vespae, commonly known as the bee-nest ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its ornamental, clustered inflorescences that resemble a bee's nest, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a distinct waxy texture. While primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, it also has traditional uses in local medicine."
