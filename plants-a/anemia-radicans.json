    "intro": "Anemia radicans, commonly known as bleeding heart, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped red blooms that appear in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces pendulous, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its tendency to \"bleed\" when cut, as it exudes a sap-like substance."
