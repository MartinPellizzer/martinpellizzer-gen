    "intro": "Aconitum tuscheticum, commonly known as the Tschetschenskaya aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spiky inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous. Aconitum tuscheticum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.",
