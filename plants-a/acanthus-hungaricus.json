    "intro": "Acanthus hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian acanthus, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spire-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually white or pale blue and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Acanthus hungaricus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and architectural foliage.",

This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and coastal areas across these regions. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acanthus hungaricus is often associated with limestone formations and can be seen growing on cliffs or in rocky habitats. Its distribution is largely confined to the southeastern European region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus hungaricus was mainly introduced to Czechia-Slovakia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and architectural appearance. It has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant is considered non-native to the area and has established populations in certain parts of the country. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
