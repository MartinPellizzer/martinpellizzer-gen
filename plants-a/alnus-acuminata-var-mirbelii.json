    "intro": "Alnus acuminata var. mirbelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically narrow and pointed, giving it a distinct appearance. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found near streams or in wetlands. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
