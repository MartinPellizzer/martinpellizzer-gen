    "intro": "Arenaria pentagyna, commonly known as the five-angled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. This species is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
