    "intro": "Ajuga makinoi, commonly known as Japanese bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a decorative ground cover and a potential weed in some regions."
