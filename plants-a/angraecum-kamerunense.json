    "intro": "Angraecum kamerunense, commonly known as the Cameroon star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Cameroon and neighboring regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hawkmoths, which are attracted by their nectar and the plant's night-blooming habit. Angraecum kamerunense is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the local ecosystems of its native habitat."
