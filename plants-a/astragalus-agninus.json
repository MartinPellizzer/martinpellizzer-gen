    "intro": "Astragalus agninus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats. Astragalus agninus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
