    "intro": "Astragalus chrysostachys, commonly known as golden crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
