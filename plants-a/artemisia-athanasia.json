    "intro": "Artemisia athanasia, commonly known as the everlasting plant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The common name \"everlasting\" refers to its ability to retain its color and form even after drying."
