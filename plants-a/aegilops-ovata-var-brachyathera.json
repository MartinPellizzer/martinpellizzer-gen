    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive awns that are shorter than those of the typical Aegilops ovata. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with leathery, dark brown glumes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky slopes. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and genetic diversity."
