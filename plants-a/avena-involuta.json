    "intro": "Avena involuta, commonly known as the curled oat or curly oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish dense stands in disturbed soils. Avena involuta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
