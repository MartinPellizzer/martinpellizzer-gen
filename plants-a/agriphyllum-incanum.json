    "intro": "Agriphyllum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Agriphyllum incanum is a shrub that is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
