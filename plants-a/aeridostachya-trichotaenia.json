    "intro": "Aeridostachya trichotaenia, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed flame grass, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that contributes to its drought tolerance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
