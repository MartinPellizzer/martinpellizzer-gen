    "intro": "Angelica keiskei f. foliosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian giant taro, is a variant of the angelica plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, with a distinctive waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This unique foliage makes it a striking ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its historical and cultural significance in Hawaii."
