    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida var. radiisecta, commonly known as the silverleaf alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a rosette of silver-gray, velvety foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a unique radiating pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
