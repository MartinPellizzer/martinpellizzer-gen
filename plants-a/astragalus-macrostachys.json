    "intro": "Astragalus macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, legume-like pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus macrostachys is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
