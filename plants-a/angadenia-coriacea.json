    "intro": "Angadenia coriacea, commonly known as the rough angadenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, fragrant flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically blooms in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Angadenia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
