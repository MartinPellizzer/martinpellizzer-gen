    "intro": "Appendicula reflexa var. kotoensis, commonly known as the Kotoensis appendicula, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in spring, with petals that are often pale pink to white in color. The plant has a low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
