    "intro": "Acer japonicum var. insulare, commonly known as the Japanese maple var. insulare, is a compact, slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a rounded or spreading growth habit. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruit.",
