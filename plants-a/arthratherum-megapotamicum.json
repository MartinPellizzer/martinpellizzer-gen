    "intro": "Arthratherum megapotamicum, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Arthratherum megapotamicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
