    "intro": "Avenula hackelii var. algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbiensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland margins and stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species within its native range."
