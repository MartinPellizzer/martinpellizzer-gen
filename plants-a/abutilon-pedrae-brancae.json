It thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic Forest biome. It is commonly observed in areas with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Its natural habitat includes dunes and rocky outcrops near the coast.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pedrae-brancae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments. It thrives in regions with warm, temperate climates and moderate to high rainfall. This species is often found in coastal and inland regions where it can establish itself quickly in open, sunny areas. Its adaptability to different soil types and ability to tolerate environmental stress contribute to its successful spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive growth and potential to alter local ecosystems."
