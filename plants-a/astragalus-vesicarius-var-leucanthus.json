    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius var. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its pale flowers, which set it apart from other Astragalus species in the region."
