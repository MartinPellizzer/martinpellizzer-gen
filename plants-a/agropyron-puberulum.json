    "intro": "Agropyron puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Agropyron puberulum is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
