    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. turkestanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",

It is commonly found in mountainous areas and dry steppe environments. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or forested landscapes. Its distribution extends into the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. It is a relatively rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. turkestanicum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and is often found in mountainous or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to different soil types. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in regions with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
