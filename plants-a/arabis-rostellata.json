    "intro": "Arabis rostellata, commonly known as the rostellate rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions."
