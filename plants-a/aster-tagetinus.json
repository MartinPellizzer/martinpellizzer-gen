    "intro": "Aster tagetinus, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features aromatic, yellowish-green leaves with a strong, bitter scent, and its flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
