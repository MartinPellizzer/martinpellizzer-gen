    "intro": "Andryala rothia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, and they contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to animals and humans. Andryala rothia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated, but caution is necessary due to its toxic properties."
