    "intro": "Apacheria chiricahuensis, commonly known as the Chiricahua lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
