It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This form is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
