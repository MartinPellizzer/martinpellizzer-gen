    "intro": "Ardisia perpendicularis, commonly known as the upright ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Ardisia perpendicularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
