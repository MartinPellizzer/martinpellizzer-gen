    "intro": "Allium vineale var. biceps, commonly known as two-headed garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in umbels, which are typically followed by small, spherical bulbils. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Due to its garlic-like scent, it is sometimes mistaken for wild garlic but lacks the strong flavor of true Allium species."
