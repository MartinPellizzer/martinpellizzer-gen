It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It is often found in association with other native grasses and forbs in moist to mesic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
