It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that ripen in the autumn. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy texture. The strawberry tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
