    "intro": "Acacia curranii, commonly known as the Curran's wattle, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Acacia genus. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens in regions with a suitable climate.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia curranii is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in sandy or loamy soils within open woodlands and heathlands. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas, particularly in the eastern part of Australia. Acacia curranii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia curranii was mainly introduced to the western regions of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It has been established in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along creek banks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively and compete with native vegetation. Efforts are being made to monitor its distribution and manage its impact on local ecosystems."
