    "intro": "Alchemilla aggregata, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in loose clusters. Alchemilla aggregata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to retain moisture."
