    "intro": "Ajuga pseudoiva, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it an effective erosion control plant."
