    "intro": "Artabotrys monogynus, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
