    "intro": "Astragalus obscurus, commonly known as the dark milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. Its small, hairy pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus obscurus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators."
