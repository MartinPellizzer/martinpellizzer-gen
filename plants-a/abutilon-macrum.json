    "intro": "Abutilon macrum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous, soft hairs are a distinctive botanical feature, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Abutilon macrum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon macrum is primarily native to Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal or inland dunes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon macrum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in coastal regions. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
