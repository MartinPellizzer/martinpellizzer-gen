    "intro": "Arenaria octandra, commonly known as the eight-angled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria octandra plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
