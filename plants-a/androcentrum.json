    "intro": "Androcentrum, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Androcentrum species are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in horticulture."
