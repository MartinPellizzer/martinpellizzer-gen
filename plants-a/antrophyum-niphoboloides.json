    "intro": "Antrophyum niphoboloides, commonly known as the snowball cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical inflorescence that resembles a snowball, consisting of numerous small, yellowish female flowers surrounded by a cluster of green, leaf-like structures. The plant has a slow growth rate and is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
