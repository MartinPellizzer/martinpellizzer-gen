    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. microdon, commonly known as the miniature pineapple bromeliad, is a compact bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
