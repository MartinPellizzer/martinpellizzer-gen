    "intro": "Agrimonia pilosa var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems covered in sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and have a rough, textured surface. Agrimonia pilosa var. viscidula is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils."
