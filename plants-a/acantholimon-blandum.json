    "intro": "Acantholimon blandum, commonly known as the bluntleaf flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Acantholimon blandum is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon blandum is primarily native to Iran and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species in both Iran and Turkmenistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon blandum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often found in coastal regions and sandy habitats. It is typically spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, or human activity. This plant has become established in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. Despite its adaptability, it is not considered a major invasive species in most areas."
