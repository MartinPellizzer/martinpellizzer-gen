It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its essential oils contribute to its distinctive aroma and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
