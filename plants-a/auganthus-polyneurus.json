It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
