This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial shade. Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lineatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers and horticulturists who admired its unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environment of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have contributed to its widespread establishment in non-native regions."
