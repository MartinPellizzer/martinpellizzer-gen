    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n alder, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often near streams or in forested areas. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth upper surface and hairy underside. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alnus jorullensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
