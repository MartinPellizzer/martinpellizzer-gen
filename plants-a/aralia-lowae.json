    "intro": "Aralia lowae, commonly known as the Low's aralia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately divided with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in an umbel, which are often borne on long, slender peduncles. Aralia lowae thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
