    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys var. glabra, commonly known as smooth woodruff, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
