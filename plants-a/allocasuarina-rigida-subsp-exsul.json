    "intro": "Allocasuarina rigida subsp. exsul, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing edible seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with low rainfall. This subspecies is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
