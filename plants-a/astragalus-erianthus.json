    "intro": "Astragalus erianthus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, yellow or white pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Astragalus erianthus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
