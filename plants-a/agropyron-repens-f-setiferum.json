    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. setiferum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which sets it apart from the standard form. This grass is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It has a creeping growth habit, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
