    "intro": "Apocynum luridum, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Apocynaceae family. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Apocynum luridum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxic properties limit its use in traditional herbal medicine."
