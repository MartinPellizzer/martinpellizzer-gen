It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of other Alocasia species. The plant produces small, white flowers that are usually hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
