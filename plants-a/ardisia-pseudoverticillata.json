It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem.

This plant is often found in shaded, moist forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
