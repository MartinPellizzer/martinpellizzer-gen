    "intro": "Acacia moirii subsp. dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust and hairy growth compared to other acacia species.",

It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Fitzgerald River National Park. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia moirii subsp. dasycarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and floral displays. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions, such as parts of Australia and New Zealand. However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and local climate."
