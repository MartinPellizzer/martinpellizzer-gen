It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils.

This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus perringii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded woodland areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and unique, spiky flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competition with native vegetation."
