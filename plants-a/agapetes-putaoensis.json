    "intro": "Agapetes putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao miteleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Myanmar, particularly in the Putao area. This evergreen shrub typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agapetes putaoensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
