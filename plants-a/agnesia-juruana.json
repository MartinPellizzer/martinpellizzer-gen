    "intro": "Agnesia juruana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
