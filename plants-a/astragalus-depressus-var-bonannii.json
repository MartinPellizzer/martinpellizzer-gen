    "intro": "Astragalus depressus var. bonannii, commonly known as the Bonann's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
