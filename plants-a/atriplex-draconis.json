    "intro": "Atriplex draconis, commonly known as dragon's tail, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats. Atriplex draconis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
