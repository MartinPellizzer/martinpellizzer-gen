    "intro": "Arenaria muscosa, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arenaria muscosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
