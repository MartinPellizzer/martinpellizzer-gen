    "intro": "Aetanthus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Aetanthus subandinus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
