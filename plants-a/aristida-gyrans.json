    "intro": "Aristida gyrans, commonly known as the whirling grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that gives it a unique, almost whimsical appearance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Aristida gyrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
