    "intro": "Aconitum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that reflects light. Aconitum exaltatum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
