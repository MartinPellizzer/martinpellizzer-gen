    "intro": "Agrostis hirta, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with short, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as meadows, lawns, and along stream banks."
