    "intro": "Asplenium juglandifolium var. eucalyptifolium, commonly known as the eucalyptus fern, is a variant of the common wood spleenwort. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that resemble the foliage of eucalyptus trees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
