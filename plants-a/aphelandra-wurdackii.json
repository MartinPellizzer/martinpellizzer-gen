    "intro": "Aphelandra wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's torch ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like inflorescences that display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra wurdackii is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its preference for indirect light and moderate watering."
