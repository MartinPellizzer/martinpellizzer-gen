    "intro": "Ajuga orientalis var. condensata, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and extended blooming period. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers."
