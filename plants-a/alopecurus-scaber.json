    "intro": "Alopecurus scaber, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Alopecurus scaber is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
