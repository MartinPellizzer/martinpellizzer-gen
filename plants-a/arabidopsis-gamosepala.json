    "intro": "Arabidopsis gamosepala, commonly known as the common Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or yellow flowers. The plant has a short life cycle, typically completing its growth within a few weeks, making it a model organism in plant biology research. Its gamosepalous calyx, where all five sepals are fused at the base, is a distinctive botanical feature."
