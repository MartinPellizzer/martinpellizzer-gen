    "intro": "Aristolochia maurorum var. aucheri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with a distinctive, hollow, pipe-like flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, with the flowers being tubular and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
