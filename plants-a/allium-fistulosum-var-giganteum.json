    "intro": "Allium fistulosum var. giganteum, commonly known as giant garlic chives, is a cultivar of the chive plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, flat leaves. It is native to Asia and is often cultivated for its mild garlic flavor and ornamental value. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, adding visual appeal to gardens. Its leaves are edible and can be used in cooking similarly to regular chives. This variety is hardy and adaptable, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
