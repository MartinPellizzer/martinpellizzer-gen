    "intro": "Agrostis airoides var. flaccidifolia, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
