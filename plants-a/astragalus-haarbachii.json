    "intro": "Astragalus haarbachii, commonly known as the Harbach's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Astragalus haarbachii is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
