    "intro": "Artemisia stricta, commonly known as stiff wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Artemisia stricta has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of essential oils."
