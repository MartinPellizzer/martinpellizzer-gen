It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
