    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
