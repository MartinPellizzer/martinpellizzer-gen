It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, creeping stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
