    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. dasyphyllus, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses dense, cylindrical leaves that reduce water loss and help it thrive in coastal areas. The plant forms tussocks, which stabilize sediments and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in estuaries and tidal flats, playing a vital role in coastal ecosystems."
