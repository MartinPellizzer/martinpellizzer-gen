    "intro": "Angraecum tamarindicola, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typical of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
