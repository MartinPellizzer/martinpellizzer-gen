    "intro": "Ammodenia major, commonly known as the coastal lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and arid conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can reach depths of several feet, allowing it to access water in nutrient-poor environments. Ammodenia major is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
