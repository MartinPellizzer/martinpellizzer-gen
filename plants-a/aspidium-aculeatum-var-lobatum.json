    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. lobatum, commonly known as the lobed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, upright rhizome with fronds that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
