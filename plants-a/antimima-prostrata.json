    "intro": "Antimima prostrata, commonly known as prostrate antimima, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically features prostrate or sprawling stems that hug the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Antimima prostrata is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
