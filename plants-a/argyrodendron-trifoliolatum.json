    "intro": "Argyrodendron trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf argyrodendron, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by ornamental, spherical fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
