    "intro": "Asperula hypanica, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with spreading stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and persist through the winter, providing year-round interest. Asperula hypanica thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
