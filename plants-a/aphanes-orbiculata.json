    "intro": "Aphanes orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, orbicular leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Aphanes orbiculata is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it a hardy species well-suited to harsh environments."
