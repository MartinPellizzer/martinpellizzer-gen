    "intro": "Asplenium schizodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Asplenium schizodon is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
