It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Acrostichum feejeense is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.",
