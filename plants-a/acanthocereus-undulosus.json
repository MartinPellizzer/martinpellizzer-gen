    "intro": "Acanthocereus undulosus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by moths and bats. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus undulosus is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as parts of northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert regions and rocky plains. This cactus is commonly seen in the Chihuahuan Desert, where it adapts well to the harsh, dry climate. It is also present in the Sonoran Desert, though less frequently than in the Chihuahuan region. The plant is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus undulosus was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions such as Texas and Arizona. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique, waxy leaves and striking red flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its introduction has led to ecological impacts in some regions."
