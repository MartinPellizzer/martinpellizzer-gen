    "intro": "Azalea viscosa alba, commonly known as the silky azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a silky texture, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
