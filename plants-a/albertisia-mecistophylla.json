    "intro": "Albertisia mecistophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of tiny leaflets. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Albertisia mecistophylla is considered a threatened species in its native range."
