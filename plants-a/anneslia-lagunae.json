    "intro": "Anneslia lagunae, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy as well. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Anneslia lagunae plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
