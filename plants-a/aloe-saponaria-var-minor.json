    "intro": "Aloe saponaria var. minor, commonly known as the lesser soap aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are covered in a white, soapy substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in arid climate plants."
