It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low moisture conditions. Astragalus baerlukensis is often found in steppes and rocky areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
