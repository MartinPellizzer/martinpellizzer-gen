    "intro": "Allium waldsteinii, commonly known as the Waldstein's onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, pale purple to lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, topped with a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are small and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Allium waldsteinii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
