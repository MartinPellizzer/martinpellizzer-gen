    "intro": "Arceuthobium occidentale, commonly known as the western dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed when the berries are shaken by wind or animals, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important ecological component in forest ecosystems."
