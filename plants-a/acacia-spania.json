    "intro": "Acacia spania, commonly known as the Spanish acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and it is adapted to arid and coastal environments. Acacia spania is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia spania is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the northeastern part of the state, particularly in the wet tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and rainforests. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia spania is also valued for its hardy nature and ornamental qualities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia spania was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced as an ornamental species in some tropical and subtropical areas. However, its rapid growth and spreading habit have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
