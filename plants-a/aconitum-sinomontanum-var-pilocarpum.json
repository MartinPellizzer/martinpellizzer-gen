    "intro": "Aconitum sinomontanum var. pilocarpum, commonly known as the Pilocarpum Aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters called racemes. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, which contribute to its reputation as a potent and dangerous plant. This variety is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance among other Aconitum species.",
