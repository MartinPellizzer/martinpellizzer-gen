    "intro": "Astragalus titanophilus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with well-drained soils. Astragalus titanophilus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
