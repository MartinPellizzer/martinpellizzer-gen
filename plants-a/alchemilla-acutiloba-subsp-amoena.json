    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba subsp. amoena, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
