    "intro": "Astragalina alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Astragalina alpina is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps enrich the soil in nutrient-poor environments. Its ecological importance includes providing food for various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
