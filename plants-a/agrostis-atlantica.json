    "intro": "Agrostis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing fluffy, pale-green to yellowish spikelets. Agrostis atlantica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
