    "intro": "Anthurium schulenbergii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or maroon tint. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose small, spadix-like inflorescences, which are its actual flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium schulenbergii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
