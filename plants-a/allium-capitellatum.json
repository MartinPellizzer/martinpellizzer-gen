    "intro": "Allium capitellatum, commonly known as the bulbous leek or clustered garlic, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures at the base, which are often used in culinary applications similar to garlic or leeks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and edible qualities, Allium capitellatum is both a decorative and useful plant in horticulture."
