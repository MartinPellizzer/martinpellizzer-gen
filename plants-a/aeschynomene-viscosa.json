    "intro": "Aeschynomene viscosa, commonly known as sticky leaf aeschynomene, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Aeschynomene viscosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
