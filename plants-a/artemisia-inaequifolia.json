    "intro": "Artemisia inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive asymmetrical shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Artemisia inaequifolia is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
