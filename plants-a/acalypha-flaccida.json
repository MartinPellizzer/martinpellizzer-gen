    "intro": "Acalypha flaccida, commonly known as the softleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Acalypha flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

This species is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, which are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It thrives in the volcanic soil and coastal habitats of the archipelago. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and environmental conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its presence is an important indicator of the region's biodiversity and ecological balance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha flaccida was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is commonly found in regions such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and tropical Africa. The plant is often spread through human activities, including accidental transport via contaminated soil or seed dispersal by animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some environments. However, in its native range, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
