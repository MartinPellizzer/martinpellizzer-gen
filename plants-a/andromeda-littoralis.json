    "intro": "Andromeda littoralis, commonly known as coastal wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. The plant features small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Andromeda littoralis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
