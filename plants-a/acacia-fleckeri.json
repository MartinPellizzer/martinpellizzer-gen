    "intro": "Acacia fleckeri, commonly known as the Darling River acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Acacia fleckeri plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia fleckeri is primarily native to Queensland. This species is found in the northern parts of the state, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the local ecosystem. Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia fleckeri was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been reported in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal and human activities such as land clearing and revegetation projects. Due to its resilience, it has become a common species in disturbed ecosystems."
