The plant has basal leaves that are narrowly ovate with serrated edges, and its stems are hairy and often branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
