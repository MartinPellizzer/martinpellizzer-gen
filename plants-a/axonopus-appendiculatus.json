    "intro": "Axonopus appendiculatus, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft blades that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along forest margins. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers, and it is known for its ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic. Axonopus appendiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
