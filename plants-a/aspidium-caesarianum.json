    "intro": "Aspidium caesarianum, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium caesarianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
