    "intro": "Atriplex microphylla, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Atriplex microphylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions."
