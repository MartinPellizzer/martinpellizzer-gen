    "intro": "Arenaria thymifolia, commonly known as thyme-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an important component of cold climate ecosystems."
