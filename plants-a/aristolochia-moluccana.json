    "intro": "Aristolochia moluccana, commonly known as the Indonesian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions, though caution is advised due to its toxicity."
