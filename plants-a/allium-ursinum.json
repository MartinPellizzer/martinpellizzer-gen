    "intro": "Allium ursinum, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its pungent odor, which is due to sulfur-containing compounds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring. Its roots and leaves are edible but can be toxic in large quantities. It is often found in woodland areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
