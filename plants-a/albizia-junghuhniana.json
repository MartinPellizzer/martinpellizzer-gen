    "intro": "Albizia junghuhniana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pods are elongated, containing several seeds, and the tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. Albizia junghuhniana also has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types but sensitive to waterlogging."
