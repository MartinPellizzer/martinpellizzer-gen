    "intro": "Artemisia blepharolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. Artemisia blepharolepis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
