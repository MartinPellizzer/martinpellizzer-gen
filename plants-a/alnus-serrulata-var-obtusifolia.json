    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, elliptical leaves that are broader and less serrated compared to the typical alnus species. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
