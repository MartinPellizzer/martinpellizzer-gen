    "intro": "Atriplex lacera, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Atriplex lacera is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
