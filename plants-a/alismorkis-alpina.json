    "intro": "Alismorkis alpina, commonly known as the alpine water plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Alismarceae and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender stems. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Alismorkis alpina is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams."
