    "intro": "Aulomyrcia alloiota var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
