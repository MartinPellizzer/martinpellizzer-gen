    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda pulchella var. intermedia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This variant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and humid subtropical climates. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda pulchella var. intermedia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern and southeastern United States. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been introduced to various garden settings and naturalized in some areas outside its native range. However, its spread is generally limited and does not pose a significant ecological threat."
