    "intro": "Acer cissifolium, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 8 to 15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental species in gardens.",
