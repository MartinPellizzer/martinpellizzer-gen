    "intro": "Alnus incana f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its ovate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on both sides. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
