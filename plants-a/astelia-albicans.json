    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astilea albicans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features a dense, feathery foliage composed of lance-shaped, silver-white leaves that are highly reflective. The plant's unique appearance is due to its specialized leaf structure, which includes a central stem with multiple leaf sheaths. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Astelia albicans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
