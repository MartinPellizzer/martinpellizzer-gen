    "intro": "Amyema eburna, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. Amyema eburna is well adapted to humid, shady environments and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
