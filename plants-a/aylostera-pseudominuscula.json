    "intro": "Aylostera pseudominuscula, commonly known as the dwarf aylostera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its small stature and delicate appearance make it a sought-after species for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
