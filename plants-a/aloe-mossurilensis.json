It belongs to the Aloe genus and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, spiky leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
