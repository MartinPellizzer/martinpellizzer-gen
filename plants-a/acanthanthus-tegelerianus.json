    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthanthus tegelerianus is primarily native to the southern regions of South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas where the climate is Mediterranean. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's seasonal rainfall patterns. It is often seen growing in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthanthus tegelerianus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and unique foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
