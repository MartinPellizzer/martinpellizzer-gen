    "intro": "Ardisia polygama, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant has glossy, ovate leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The berries persist through winter, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
