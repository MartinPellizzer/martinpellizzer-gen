    "intro": "Acaena distichophylla, commonly known as the New Zealand bracken, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Acaena distichophylla is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena distichophylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the North and South Islands. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the subantarctic and temperate regions of New Zealand. Acaena distichophylla is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena distichophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in disturbed soils. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
