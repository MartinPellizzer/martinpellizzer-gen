    "intro": "Alyssum grandiflorum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and profuse clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum grandiflorum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
