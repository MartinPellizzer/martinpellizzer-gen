    "intro": "Asplenium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, which exhibit different forms depending on their position on the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are often divided into two distinct types: the fertile fronds, which bear spores, and the sterile fronds, which are usually broader and more elongated. This species is found in various regions across Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent."
