    "intro": "Astragalus citrinus subsp. barrowianus, commonly known as the Barrow's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and specific floral morphology compared to other Astragalus species."
