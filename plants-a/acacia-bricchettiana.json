    "intro": "Acacia bricchettiana, commonly known as the Briccett's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Acacia bricchettiana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia bricchettiana is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests, savannas, and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the tropical climate and can tolerate both drought and seasonal rainfall. Due to its unique characteristics, it is considered an important component of Madagascar's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bricchettiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
