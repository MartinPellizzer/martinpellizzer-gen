    "intro": "Alectorolophus subulatus, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often used as an indicator species for wetland health."
