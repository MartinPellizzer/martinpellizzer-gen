    "intro": "Acer lobelii var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a striking deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.",
