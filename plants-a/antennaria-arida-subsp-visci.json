    "intro": "Antennaria arida subsp. visci, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, hairless leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of soil. Antennaria arida subsp. visci plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
