    "intro": "Aspidium pubescens var. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features fronds that are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, glabrous surface, distinguishing it from its pubescent counterpart. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical characteristics of this fern make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
