    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa var. comosa, commonly known as the hairy spikelet wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, hairy spikelets and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is closely related to other species in the genus Aegilops, which are often used in wheat breeding programs. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
