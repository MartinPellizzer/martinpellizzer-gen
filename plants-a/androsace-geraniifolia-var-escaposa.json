    "intro": "Androsace geraniifolia var. escaposa, commonly known as the Sierra pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate it from cold temperatures. Its flowers are arranged in a cyme and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
