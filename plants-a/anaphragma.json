    "intro": "Anaphragma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tropical and subtropical distribution, with species found primarily in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have large, heart-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, greenish flowers surrounded by a spathe. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage. However, many species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
