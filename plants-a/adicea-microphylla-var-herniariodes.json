    "intro": "Adicea microphylla var. herniariodes, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, gray-green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland saltbush habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",
