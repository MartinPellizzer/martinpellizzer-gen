    "intro": "Acalypha muralis, commonly known as the wall goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its growth habit is sprawling, making it suitable for ground cover or as a decorative plant in gardens. Acalypha muralis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha muralis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya. It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its native range extends into some regions of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha muralis was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found growing along roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned lots. This plant is often considered a weed because of its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive foliage."
