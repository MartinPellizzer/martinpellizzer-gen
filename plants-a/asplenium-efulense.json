    "intro": "Asplenium efulense, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Asplenium efulense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
