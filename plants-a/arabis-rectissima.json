    "intro": "Arabis rectissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces rounded, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Arabis rectissima is often found in open habitats such as meadows, cliffs, and rocky outcrops."
