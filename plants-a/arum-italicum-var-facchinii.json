    "intro": "Arum italicum var. facchinii, commonly known as the White Arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tint, and it produces striking white spadices surrounded by a deep purple spathe. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil and indirect light. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in humid environments and is popular for its dramatic, tropical appearance."
