    "intro": "Astragalus haarbachii var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
