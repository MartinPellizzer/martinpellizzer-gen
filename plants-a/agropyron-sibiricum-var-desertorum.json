    "intro": "Agropyron sibiricum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, blue-green blades that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stem, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to prevent soil erosion. Its small, hard seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in harsh environments."
