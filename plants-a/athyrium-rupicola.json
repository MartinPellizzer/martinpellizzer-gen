    "intro": "Athyrium rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. Athyrium rupicola is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
