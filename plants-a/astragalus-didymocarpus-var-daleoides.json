    "intro": "Astragalus didymocarpus var. daleoides, commonly known as the Dale's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, two-seeded pods that remain closed until mature, a trait known as cleistogamy. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is often considered a species of conservation concern."
