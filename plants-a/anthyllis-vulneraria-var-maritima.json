    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and other coastal environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy perennial."
