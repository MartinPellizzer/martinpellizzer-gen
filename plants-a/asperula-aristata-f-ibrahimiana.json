It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
