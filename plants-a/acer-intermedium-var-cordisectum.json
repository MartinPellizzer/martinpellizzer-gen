    "intro": "Acer intermedium var. cordisectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a variant of the intermediate maple characterized by its unique leaf morphology. Its leaves are deeply lobed, often appearing almost fern-like due to the intricate division of the leaf blade. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, particularly in gardens and landscapes where its delicate foliage stands out. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.",
