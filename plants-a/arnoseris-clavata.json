    "intro": "Arnoseris clavata, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Arnoseris clavata is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, supporting soil fertility in degraded landscapes."
