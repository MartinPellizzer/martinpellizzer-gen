    "intro": "Actinea vaseyi, commonly known as the Vanuatu starfish flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that resemble the arms of a starfish, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is known for its delicate, pale yellow to white petals. Actinea vaseyi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
