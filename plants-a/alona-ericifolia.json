    "intro": "Alona ericifolia, commonly known as the heath or dwarf heather, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and tundra environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with limited sunlight. Alona ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
