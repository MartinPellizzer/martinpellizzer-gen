    "intro": "Asplenium cicutarium var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, pale green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
