    "intro": "Aristida riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande threeawn, is a grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the branches. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Its foliage is usually gray-green, and it produces pale to brownish flowers during the summer months. Aristida riograndensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
