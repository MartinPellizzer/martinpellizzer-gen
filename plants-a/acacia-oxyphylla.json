    "intro": "Acacia oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia oxyphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

It is commonly found in the interior parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. Acacia oxyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oxyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid or semi-arid climates. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it has become established."
