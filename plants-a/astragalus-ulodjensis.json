It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience in harsh conditions. However, it is relatively rare and may be threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing."
