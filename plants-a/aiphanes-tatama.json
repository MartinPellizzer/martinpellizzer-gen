    "intro": "Aiphanes tatama, commonly known as the Tatama palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern South America, particularly in Argentina and Uruguay. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Aiphanes tatama is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that can tolerate waterlogged soil conditions."
