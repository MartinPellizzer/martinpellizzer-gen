    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia baileyana var. purpurea is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions in New South Wales and Victoria. This variety is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils along the eastern coast of the country. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant is known for its striking purple foliage, which distinguishes it from other acacia species. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also popular as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia baileyana var. purpurea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive purple foliage and hardy nature. It is commonly used in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is native to Australia but has been widely cultivated in other regions with similar climates. Its introduction has led to its presence in several countries, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
