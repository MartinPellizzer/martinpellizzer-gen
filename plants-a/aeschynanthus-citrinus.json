    "intro": "Aeschynanthus citrinus, commonly known as the golden wax plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The flowers are borne on long, pendulous stems, giving it a cascading effect that makes it popular in hanging baskets."
