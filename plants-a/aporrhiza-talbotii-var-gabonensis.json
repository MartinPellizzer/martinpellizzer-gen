    "intro": "Aporrhiza talbotii var. gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Central and West Africa. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as estuaries and tidal mudflats. The plant exhibits specialized adaptations, including salt-excreting glands on its leaves and a complex root system that stabilizes coastal sediments. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in brackish conditions. This variant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stability by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
