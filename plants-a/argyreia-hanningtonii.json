    "intro": "Argyreia hanningtonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
