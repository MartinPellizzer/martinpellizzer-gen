    "intro": "Artemisia pycnocephala, commonly known as bighead wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Artemisia pycnocephala plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
