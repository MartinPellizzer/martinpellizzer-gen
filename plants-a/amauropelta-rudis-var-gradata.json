This fern is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, upright fronds that are often clustered near the base. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
