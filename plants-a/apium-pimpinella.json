    "intro": "Apium pimpinella, commonly known as clustered parsley, is a small, herbaceous annual plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal uses. Apium pimpinella is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions."
