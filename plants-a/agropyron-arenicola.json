    "intro": "Agropyron arenicola, commonly known as the sandgrass or sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in sandy soils with low nutrient content. It is often found in dunes, gravelly plains, and other dry environments. Agropyron arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
