    "intro": "Alnus oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Alnus oblongifolia is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil for other plant species."
