    "intro": "Astragalus siculus var. calabrus, commonly known as the Calabrian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily and southern Italy. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Astragalus siculus."
