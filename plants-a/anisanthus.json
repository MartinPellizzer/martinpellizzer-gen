    "intro": "Anisanthus, commonly known as the yellow daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its showy, yellow ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. Anisanthus species are known for their ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them drought-tolerant. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
