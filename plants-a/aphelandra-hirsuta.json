    "intro": "Aphelandra hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy torch plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra hirsuta is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its dramatic appearance and air-purifying qualities."
