    "intro": "Antidesma neurocarpum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved antidesma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential due to its unique foliage."
