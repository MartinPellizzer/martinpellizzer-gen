    "intro": "Aristolochia cyclochilia, commonly known as the spiral-shaped Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spiral-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces a fragrant, greenish-yellow flower that opens in a helical pattern, a feature that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
