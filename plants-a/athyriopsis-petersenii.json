    "intro": "Athyriopsis petersenii, commonly known as Petersen's wood fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, serrated leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of old-growth forests."
