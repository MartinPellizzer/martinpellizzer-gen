    "intro": "Aconitum delavayi var. coreanum, commonly known as Korean monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea and northeastern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, handling the plant requires caution as all parts contain potent alkaloids.",
