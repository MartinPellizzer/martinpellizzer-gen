    "intro": "Agati formosa, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish water environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Agati formosa plays an important role in coastal stabilization and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
