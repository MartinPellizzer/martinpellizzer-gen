    "intro": "Athanasia viridis, commonly known as the green everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, hence its common name, and it produces fluffy seed heads that add visual interest in late summer. Athanasia viridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
