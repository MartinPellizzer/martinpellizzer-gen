    "intro": "Alyssum utriculatum, commonly known as bladderleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and features distinctive bladder-like structures on its stems, which are thought to be remnants of its evolutionary past. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Alyssum utriculatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
