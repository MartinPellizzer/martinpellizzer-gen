    "intro": "Acalypha linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Acalypha linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha linearifolia is primarily native to Madagascar. It is commonly found in the island's dry and humid regions. This plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha linearifolia was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in environments with moderate to high light exposure. It is commonly found along roadsides, construction sites, and in abandoned lots where human activity has altered the natural landscape. This plant has become a common weed in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in some areas, as it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity. Despite its invasive tendencies, Acalypha linearifolia is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ornamental value."
