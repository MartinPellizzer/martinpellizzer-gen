    "intro": "Astragalus otosemius, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
