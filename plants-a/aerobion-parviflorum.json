It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to temperate regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of other members of its family, and it produces a subtle, aromatic scent. The small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
