It typically features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
