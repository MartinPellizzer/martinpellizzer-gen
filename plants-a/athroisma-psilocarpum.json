    "intro": "Athroisma psilocarpum, commonly known as the purple-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often bluish-green or purplish in color, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. Athroisma psilocarpum is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
