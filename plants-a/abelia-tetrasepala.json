    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia tetrasepala is primarily native to eastern North America, specifically the southeastern United States. It is found in states such as Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, in woodland edges, and in shaded to partially sunny areas. It is commonly associated with the Appalachian region and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Abelia tetrasepala is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia tetrasepala was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrant flowers and ornamental value. It has been reported to spread along riverbanks and in disturbed areas. However, it is considered non-invasive in its introduced range."
