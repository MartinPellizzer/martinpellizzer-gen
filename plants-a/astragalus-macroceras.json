    "intro": "Astragalus macroceras, commonly known as the large-horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus macroceras is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
