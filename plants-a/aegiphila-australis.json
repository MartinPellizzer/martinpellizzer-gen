    "intro": "Aegiphila australis, commonly known as the Southern Aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Aegiphila australis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
