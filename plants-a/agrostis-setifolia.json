    "intro": "Agrostis setifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in coastal areas. Agrostis setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
