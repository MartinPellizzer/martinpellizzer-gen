    "intro": "Andropogon cubensis, commonly known as Cuban bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon cubensis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
