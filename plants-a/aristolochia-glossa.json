    "intro": "Aristolochia glossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is part of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant contains toxic compounds and has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely avoided due to health risks."
