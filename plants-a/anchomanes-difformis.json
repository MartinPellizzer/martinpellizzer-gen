    "intro": "Anchomanes difformis, commonly known as the swamp buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common species in marshes and along riverbanks. Anchomanes difformis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
