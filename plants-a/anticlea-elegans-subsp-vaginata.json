It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive spurred structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
