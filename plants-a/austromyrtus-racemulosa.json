    "intro": "Austromyrtus racemulosa, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their antimicrobial properties. Austromyrtus racemulosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
