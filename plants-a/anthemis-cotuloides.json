    "intro": "Anthemis cotuloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant is also valued for its potential in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds in its flowers."
