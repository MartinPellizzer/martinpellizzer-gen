    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
