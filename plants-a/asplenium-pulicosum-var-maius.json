    "intro": "Asplenium pulicosum var. maius, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance, with spore-producing structures on the underside. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
