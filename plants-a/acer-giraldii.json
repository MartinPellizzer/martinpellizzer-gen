    "intro": "Acer giraldii, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Acer giraldii is often cultivated in temperate climates.",
