    "intro": "Aconitum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many members of its family. Aconitum nevadense is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.",
