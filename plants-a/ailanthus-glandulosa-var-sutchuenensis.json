    "intro": "Ailanthus glandulosa var. sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese tree of heaven, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China. It features compound leaves with 10-20 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by woody, triangular pods containing seeds. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is highly tolerant of urban environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth and allelopathic properties."
