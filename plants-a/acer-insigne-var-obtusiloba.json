    "intro": "Acer insigne var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.",
