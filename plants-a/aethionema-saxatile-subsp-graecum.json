    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. graecum, commonly known as the Greek rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the main species."
