It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with soft cilia, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
