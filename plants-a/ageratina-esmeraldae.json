    "intro": "Ageratina esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Beauty, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and small, fluffy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional South American medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
