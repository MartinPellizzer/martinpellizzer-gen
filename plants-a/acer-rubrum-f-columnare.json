    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. columnare, commonly known as the columnar red maple, is a unique form of the red maple tree characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It is well-suited for small gardens or urban landscapes due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.
