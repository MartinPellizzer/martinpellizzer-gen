    "intro": "Adonis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.",
