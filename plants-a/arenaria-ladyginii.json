    "intro": "Arenaria ladyginii, commonly known as the Ladygin's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria ladyginii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude habitats."
