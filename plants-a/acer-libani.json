    "intro": "Acer libani, commonly known as the Lebanon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The Lebanon maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
