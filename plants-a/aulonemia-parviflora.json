    "intro": "Aulonemia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered aulonemia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in alpine meadows and has a low-growing, compact habit. Aulonemia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
