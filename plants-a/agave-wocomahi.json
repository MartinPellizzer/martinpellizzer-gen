    "intro": "Agave wocomahi, commonly known as the Wocomahic agave, is a species native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
