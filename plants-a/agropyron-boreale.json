    "intro": "Agropyron boreale, commonly known as the cold grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron boreale is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, arctic, and temperate grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
