It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are divided into broad, lobed segments, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
