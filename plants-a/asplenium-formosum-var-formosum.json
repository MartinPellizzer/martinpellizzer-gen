    "intro": "Asplenium formosum var. formosum, commonly known as the Formosan spleenwort, is a fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
