    "intro": "Allium cupani var. hirtovaginatum, commonly known as the hairy-ventured garlic, is a botanical variant within the Allium genus. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hairy structures on the stem and leaf sheaths, which distinguish it from other garlic species. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its bulbs are smaller compared to common garlic, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in umbels. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and mild flavor, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
