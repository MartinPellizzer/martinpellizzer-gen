It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, bitter scent and making it useful in traditional herbal medicine. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
