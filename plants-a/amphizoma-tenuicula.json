    "intro": "Amphizoma tenuicula, commonly known as the slender swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Amphizoma tenuicula is also a food source for various insects and serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
