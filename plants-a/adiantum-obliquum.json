    "intro": "Adiantum obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that are slightly curved. Adiantum obliquum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.",
