    "intro": "Atriplex linifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Atriplex linifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor, salty conditions."
