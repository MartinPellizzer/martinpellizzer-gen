    "intro": "Acanthophyllum pachycephalum, commonly known as the thick-headed spiny bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Acanthophyllum pachycephalum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.",

This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often seen in desert and steppe ecosystems across Iran. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific climatic and geological features of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum pachycephalum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. It is commonly found in sandy soils and steppes, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
