    "intro": "Athenaea wettsteiniana, commonly known as the Wettstein's athenaea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful inflorescences that stand out against its rosette-shaped leaves. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its arid environment, with leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
