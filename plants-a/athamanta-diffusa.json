    "intro": "Athamanta diffusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Athamanta diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
