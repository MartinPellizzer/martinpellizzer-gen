    "intro": "Aethephyllum lyratifolium, commonly known as the lyrate leaf aethephyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its distinctive lyrate-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and arranged in a striking, fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
