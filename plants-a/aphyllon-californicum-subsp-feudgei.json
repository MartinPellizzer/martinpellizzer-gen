    "intro": "Aphyllon californicum subsp. feudgei, commonly known as the Feudge's leafless buckwheat, is a rare flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
