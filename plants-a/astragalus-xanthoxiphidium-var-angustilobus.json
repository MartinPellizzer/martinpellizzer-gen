    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium var. angustilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for various pollinators and small mammals."
