    "intro": "Avicennia marina f. pumila, commonly known as the mangrove button mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often clustered seedlings that form dense colonies in intertidal zones. The plant has salt-excreting leaves and pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting coastal biodiversity. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems."
