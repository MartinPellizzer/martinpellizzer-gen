    "intro": "Acacia besleyi, commonly known as the Besley's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features slender, often spindly branches and produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters. The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and waxy foliage to reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia besleyi is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the south-western part of the state. This species thrives in dry, well-drained environments typical of the region's Mediterranean climate. It is often seen in open woodlands and along coastal dunes. Acacia besleyi plays an important ecological role in the local flora of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia besleyi was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and a warm climate, typically found in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, degraded forests, and agricultural fields. This plant has a spreading growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a significant ecological concern in certain areas."
