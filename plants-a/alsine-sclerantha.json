    "intro": "Alsine sclerantha, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss.
