    "intro": "Arctostaphylos insularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent island manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are typically pink or white. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round cover. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
