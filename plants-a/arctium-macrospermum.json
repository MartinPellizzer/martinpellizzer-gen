It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces and produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive and can reach significant depths, making it a resilient plant in various soil conditions. Arctium macrospermum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas."
