    "intro": "Armeriastrum eschkerense, commonly known as the Eschker's silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats."
