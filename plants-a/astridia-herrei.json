    "intro": "Astridia herrei, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features intricate, lace-like fronds with a pale green to silver hue, often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astridia herrei is considered a rare and endangered species."
