    "intro": "Agrostis aphanes, commonly known as mousegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, tufted leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
