    "intro": "Aristolochia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces two small, greenish-yellow flowers at the base of each leaf, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and twining. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues, making it important to avoid ingestion."
