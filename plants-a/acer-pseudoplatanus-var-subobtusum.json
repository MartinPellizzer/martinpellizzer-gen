    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. subobtusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and parks.",
