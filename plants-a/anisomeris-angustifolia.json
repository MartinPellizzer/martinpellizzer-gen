    "intro": "Anisomeris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh desert conditions. Anisomeris angustifolia is well adapted to drought, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
