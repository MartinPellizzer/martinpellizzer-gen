    "intro": "Anemone micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along streambanks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Anemone micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
