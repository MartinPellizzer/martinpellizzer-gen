    "intro": "Arachniodes squamulosa, commonly known as the silver-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silvery scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Arachniodes squamulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
