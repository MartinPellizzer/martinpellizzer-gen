    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish persistent populations in suitable habitats. Agrostis canina var. sylvatica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for certain wildlife species."
