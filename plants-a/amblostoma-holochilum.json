    "intro": "Amblostoma holochilum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Amblostoma holochilum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
