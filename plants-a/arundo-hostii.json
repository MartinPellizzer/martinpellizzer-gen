    "intro": "Arundo hostii, commonly known as the Mexican reed or reed grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Mexico and Central America. It features slender, arching blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, creating a graceful, fountain-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Arundo hostii is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to provide texture and movement in garden settings."
