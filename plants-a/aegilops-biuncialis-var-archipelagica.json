    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis var. archipelagica, commonly known as the island wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across coastal and island habitats. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving cereal crop resilience."
