    "intro": "Acinodendron pseudoeichleri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.",
