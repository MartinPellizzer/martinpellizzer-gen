    "intro": "Alopecurus seravschanicus, commonly known as the Crimean mouse-ear grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
