It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its intricate fronds and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
