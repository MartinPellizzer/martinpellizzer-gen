    "intro": "Annona parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, and it bears edible, round, green fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a heart-shaped base. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its fruit, which has a creamy texture and a mildly acidic flavor."
