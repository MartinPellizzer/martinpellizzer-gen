    "intro": "Acacia consanguinea, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia consanguinea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia consanguinea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate typical of much of Western Australia. Acacia consanguinea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia consanguinea was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions of Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid zones. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion. Its introduction has been primarily for land stabilization and as a source of timber and forage. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
