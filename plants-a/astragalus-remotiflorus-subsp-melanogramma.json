    "intro": "Astragalus remotiflorus subsp. melanogramma, commonly known as the black-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its subspecies distinction is based on its darker stem coloration compared to other Astragalus species."
