It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that turns a striking purplish-red color in the autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a desirable addition to shaded garden landscapes."
