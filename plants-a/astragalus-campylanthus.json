    "intro": "Astragalus campylanthus, commonly known as the bent-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus campylanthus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
