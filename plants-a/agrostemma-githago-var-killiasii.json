    "intro": "Agrostemma githago var. killiasii, commonly known as the Killias' cornflower, is a variant of the common cornflower native to southern Europe. It is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This variant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
