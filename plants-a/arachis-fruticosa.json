    "intro": "Arachis fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub peanut or wild peanut, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, similar to cultivated peanuts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Arachis fruticosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
