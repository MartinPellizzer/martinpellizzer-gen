    "intro": "Armeria elongata maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. Armeria elongata maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
