    "intro": "Amyema celebica, commonly known as the Celebes mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as dipterocarps. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Amyema celebica plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
