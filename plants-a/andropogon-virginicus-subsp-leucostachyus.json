It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer.

Its clumping growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. The plant's botanical features contribute to its ecological importance in native grassland ecosystems."
