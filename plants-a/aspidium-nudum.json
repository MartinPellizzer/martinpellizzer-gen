    "intro": "Aspidium nudum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspidiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds that lack the complex structure seen in many other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Aspidium nudum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
