    "intro": "Anthurium nelsonii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped, reddish-purple spathe that surrounds a spadix, which is typically yellow or green. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its leaves are deep green and glossy, often with a waxy texture. Anthurium nelsonii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
