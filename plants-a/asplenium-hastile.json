    "intro": "Asplenium hastile, commonly known as the broad-leaved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery, and often serrated leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. This plant is typically found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, such as crevices in walls or under rocks. Asplenium hastile has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. It is a non-flowering plant, reproducing through spores rather than seeds."
