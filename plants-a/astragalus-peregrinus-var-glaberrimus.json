    "intro": "Astragalus peregrinus var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability, featuring deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which set it apart from other Astragalus species."
