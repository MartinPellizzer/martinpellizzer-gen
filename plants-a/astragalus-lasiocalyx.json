It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, leguminous pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus lasiocalyx plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
