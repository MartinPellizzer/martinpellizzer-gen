    "intro": "Asplenium venustum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue on the underside. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
