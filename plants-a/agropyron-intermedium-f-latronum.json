    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium f. latronum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often used in restoration ecology due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion. This grass is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture and forage production."
