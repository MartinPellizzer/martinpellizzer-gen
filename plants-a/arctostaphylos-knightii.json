    "intro": "Arctostaphylos knightii, commonly known as the Knight's manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-barked stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
