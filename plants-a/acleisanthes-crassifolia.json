    "intro": "Acleisanthes crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and in desert scrub habitats.",
