    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. major, commonly known as silvergrass or white grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, particularly when sunlit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and pastures. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis alba var. major is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
