    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. dependens, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or the narrow-leaf Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southern regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical crown composed of dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cyclical cones, with female cones typically appearing every few years and containing edible seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a significant role in the ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
