    "intro": "Acaena saccaticupula var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf bull's-eyes, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, spiky, red-brown burrs that mature into persistent, spherical fruits. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena saccaticupula var. nana is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena saccaticupula var. nana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by birds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
