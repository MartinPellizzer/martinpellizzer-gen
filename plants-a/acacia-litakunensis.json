It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Pilbara and Kimberley areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with spinifex plains and sand dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Acacia litakunensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia litakunensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes. It has been introduced for purposes such as land rehabilitation and as a source of timber or forage. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites in some parts of its range."
