    "intro": "Armeria morisii, commonly known as the Moris's thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria morisii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
