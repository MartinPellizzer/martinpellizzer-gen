    "intro": "Alchemilla lecomtei, commonly known as Lecomte's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
