    "intro": "Astragalus devestitus, commonly known as the naked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with stipules that are often reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus devestitus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
