    "intro": "Agrostis longiberbis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Agrostis longiberbis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in grassland ecosystems."
