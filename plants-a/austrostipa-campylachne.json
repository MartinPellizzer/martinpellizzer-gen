    "intro": "Austrostipa campylachne, commonly known as the narrowleaf wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austrostipa campylachne plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
