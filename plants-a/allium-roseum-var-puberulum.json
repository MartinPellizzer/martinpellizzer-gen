    "intro": "Allium roseum var. puberulum, commonly known as the woolly rose garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it its varietal name \"puberulum.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like fragrance."
