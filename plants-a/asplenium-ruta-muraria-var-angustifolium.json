    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in soil stabilization."
