    "intro": "Aspidium pica, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aspidium pica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
