    "intro": "Angraecum sanfordii, commonly known as the Sanford's orchid, is a rare and striking species native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms at night, producing white or pale violet flowers with long, curling spurs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
