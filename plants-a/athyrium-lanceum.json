    "intro": "Athyrium lanceum, commonly known as the lance fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically bright green and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobili. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Athyrium lanceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
