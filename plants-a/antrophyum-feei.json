    "intro": "Antrophyum feei, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its trunk is thick and woody, often forming a short stem with a crown of leaves. Antrophyum feei is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
