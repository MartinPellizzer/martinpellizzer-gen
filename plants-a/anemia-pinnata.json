    "intro": "Anemia pinnata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate leaves that are often red or orange in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it a key species in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter water. Anemia pinnata also plays a vital role in providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
