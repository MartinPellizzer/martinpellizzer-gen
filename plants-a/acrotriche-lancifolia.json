It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
