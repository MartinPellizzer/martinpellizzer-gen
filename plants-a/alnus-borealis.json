    "intro": "Alnus borealis, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green catkins. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. It plays a vital role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
