    "intro": "Allophylus glaber var. acutissimus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves with acute tips. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitats."
