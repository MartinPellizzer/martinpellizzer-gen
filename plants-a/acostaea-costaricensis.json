    "intro": "Acostaea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, contributing to its ornamental appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Acostaea costaricensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.",
