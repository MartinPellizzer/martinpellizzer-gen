    "intro": "Athyrium acutum, commonly known as the narrowleaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
