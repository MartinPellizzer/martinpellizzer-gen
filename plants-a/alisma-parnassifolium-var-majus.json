    "intro": "Alisma parnassifolium var. majus, commonly known as the greater water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in shallow water and moist soils. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
