It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
