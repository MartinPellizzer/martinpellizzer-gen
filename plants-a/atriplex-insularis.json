    "intro": "Atriplex insularis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, often bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and desert regions. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits containing three seeds. Atriplex insularis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
