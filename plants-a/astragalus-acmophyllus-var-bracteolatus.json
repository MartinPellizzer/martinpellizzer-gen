    "intro": "Astragalus acmophyllus var. bracteolatus, commonly known as the bracteolate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spicate inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
