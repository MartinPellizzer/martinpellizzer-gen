It belongs to the kingdom Protista and is classified as a type of green algae, characterized by its chlorophyll-containing cells. This species thrives in nutrient-rich coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or submerged surfaces. Alga australis plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by serving as a primary producer and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Its structure consists of long, branching filaments that enable it to maximize light absorption for photosynthesis."
