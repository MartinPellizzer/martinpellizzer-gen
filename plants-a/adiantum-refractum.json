    "intro": "Adiantum refractum, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green to grayish in color. The fronds are often described as brittle, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Adiantum. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams.",
