    "intro": "[WRONG START] Alchemilla orthoticha f. adpressae pilosae, commonly known as the woolly alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy plant for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
