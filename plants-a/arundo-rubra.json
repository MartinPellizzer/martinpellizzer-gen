    "intro": "Arundo rubra, commonly known as the red reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that often display a striking reddish hue, especially during the autumn season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Arundo rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
