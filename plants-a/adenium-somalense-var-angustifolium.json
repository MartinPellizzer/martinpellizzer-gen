    "intro": "Adenium somalense var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert apple, is a striking succulent shrub native to arid regions of Somalia and southern Arabia. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant has palmate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.",
