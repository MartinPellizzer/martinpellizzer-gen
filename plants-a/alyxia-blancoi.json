    "intro": "Alyxia blancoi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alyxia blancoi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals in its native environment."
