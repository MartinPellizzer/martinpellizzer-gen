It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.",
