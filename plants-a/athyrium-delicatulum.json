    "intro": "Athyrium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, woolly hair. Athyrium delicatulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
