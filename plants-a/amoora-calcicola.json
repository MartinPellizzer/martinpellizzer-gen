    "intro": "Amoora calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a flowering plant native to the rocky soils of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often on limestone outcrops or in sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Amoora calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
