    "intro": "Aconitum alboviolaceum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered aconitum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue-violet to white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested, though it is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display.",
