    "intro": "Aspidium lorentzii, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium lorentzii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
