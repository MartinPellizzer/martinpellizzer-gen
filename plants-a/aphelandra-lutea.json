    "intro": "Aphelandra lutea, commonly known as the yellow flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Aphelandra lutea thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
