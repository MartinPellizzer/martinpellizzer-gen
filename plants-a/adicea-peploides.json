    "intro": "Adicea peploides, commonly known as the woolly adicea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Adicea peploides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
