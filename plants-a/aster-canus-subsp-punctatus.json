    "intro": "Aster canus subsp. punctatus, commonly known as the dotted sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive white, dotted appearance, which is most noticeable in its flower clusters."
