    "intro": "Aegiphila glandulifera var. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its upright, pyramidal growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
