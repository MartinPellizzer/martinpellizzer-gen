    "intro": "Alona micrantha, commonly known as the small water frog or water flea, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often less than 1 millimeter in size. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, allowing it to spread easily in aquatic environments. Alona micrantha plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is important for microinvertebrates and as an indicator of water quality."
