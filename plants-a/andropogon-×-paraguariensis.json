    "intro": "Andropogon \u00d7 paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its most notable feature is the use of its leaves in the preparation of a traditional infusion, which is consumed for its stimulating effects. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments."
