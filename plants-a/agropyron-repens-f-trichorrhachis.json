It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves that distinguish it from the typical form. This plant is a perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The botanical features of this variety make it valuable for ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
