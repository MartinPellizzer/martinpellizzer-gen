    "intro": "Aechmea miniata, commonly known as the miniature pineapple bromeliad, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea miniata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
