    "intro": "Allosorus myriophyllus var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent leaves and deep root system allow it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
