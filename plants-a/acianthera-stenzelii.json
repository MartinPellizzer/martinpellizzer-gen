    "intro": "Acianthera stenzelii, commonly known as the Stenzel's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on tree trunks or among foliage. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.",
