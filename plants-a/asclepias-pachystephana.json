    "intro": "Asclepias pachystephana, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, with a unique horn-shaped structure at the center. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. Asclepias pachystephana plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
