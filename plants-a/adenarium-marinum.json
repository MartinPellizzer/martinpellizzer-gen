    "intro": "Adenarium marinum, commonly known as the sea adenium, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid and saline environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens.",
