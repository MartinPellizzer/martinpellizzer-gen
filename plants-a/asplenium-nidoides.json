    "intro": "Asplenium nidoides, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes form a dense, moss-like mat that helps anchor it to its substrate. Asplenium nidoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
