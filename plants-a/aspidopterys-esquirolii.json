    "intro": "Aspidopterys esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of southeastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
