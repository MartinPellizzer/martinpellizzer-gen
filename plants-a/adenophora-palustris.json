    "intro": "Adenophora palustris, commonly known as swamp bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in moist or saturated soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Adenophora palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils.",
