    "intro": "Amyema melastomifolia, commonly known as the coastal melastome, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Amyema melastomifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
