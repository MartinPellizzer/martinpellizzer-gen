    "intro": "Acer subtrinervium, commonly known as the three-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes with prominent veins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The bark of Acer subtrinervium is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age.",
