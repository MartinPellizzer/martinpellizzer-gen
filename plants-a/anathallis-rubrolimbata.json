    "intro": "Anathallis rubrolimbata, commonly known as the red-limbed spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its unique inflorescence that bears a cluster of small, spider-like flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings, which help in attracting specific pollinators. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
