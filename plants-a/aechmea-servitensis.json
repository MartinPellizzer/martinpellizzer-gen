    "intro": "Aechmea servitensis, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered with a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal."
