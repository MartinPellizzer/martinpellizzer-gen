    "intro": "Astragalus setosulus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus setosulus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
