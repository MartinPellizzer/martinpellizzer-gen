    "intro": "Atropis rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, where it is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Atropis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
