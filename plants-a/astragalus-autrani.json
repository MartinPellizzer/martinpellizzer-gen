    "intro": "Astragalus autrani, commonly known as the Autrani milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in preventing soil erosion and supports local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects in its native habitat."
