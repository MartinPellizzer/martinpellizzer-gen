    "intro": "Aspidium oligocarpum f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically arching or pendant, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens and water features."
