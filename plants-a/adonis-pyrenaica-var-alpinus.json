    "intro": "Adonis pyrenaica var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces follicles that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
