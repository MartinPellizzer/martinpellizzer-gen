    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, bright green pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Aspidium filix-mas is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
