    "intro": "Aconitum toxicarium, commonly known as the toxic monocline, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late summer. Aconitum toxicarium contains potent alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly toxic to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal use.",
