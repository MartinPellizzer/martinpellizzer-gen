    "intro": "Armeniaca atropurpurea var. persicifolia, commonly known as the purple apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers and dark red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity and potential toxicity in large quantities."
