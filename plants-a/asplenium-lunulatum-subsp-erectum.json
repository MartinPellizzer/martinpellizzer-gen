    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum subsp. erectum, commonly known as the upright maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sori are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the sporangia are covered with a protective layer called a hymenium. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
