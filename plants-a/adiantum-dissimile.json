    "intro": "Adiantum dissimile, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including India, China, and Japan. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Adiantum dissimile is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.",
