    "intro": "Amorpha occidentalis, commonly known as western honey mesquite, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, hard pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
