It is commonly found in the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the region's unique Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of the region. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodium capense var. villosum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become established in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in open vegetation. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny leaves and small yellow flowers. It has been reported in several provinces, including the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. However, its ecological impact and spread are still being studied by local botanists."
