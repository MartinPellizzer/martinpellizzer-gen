    "intro": "Aster salicifolius var. subasper, commonly known as the rough-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name \"subasper.\" The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its foliage and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanists and gardeners alike."
