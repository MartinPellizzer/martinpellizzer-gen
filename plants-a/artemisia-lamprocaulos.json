    "intro": "Artemisia lamprocaulos, commonly known as silverstem wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
