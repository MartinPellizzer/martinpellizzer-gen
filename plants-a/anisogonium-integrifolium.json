    "intro": "Anisogonium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed anisogonium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features opposite, entire leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, well-drained soils. Anisogonium integrifolium is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions."
