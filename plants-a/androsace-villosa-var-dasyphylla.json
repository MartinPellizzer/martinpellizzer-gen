    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and shady borders."
