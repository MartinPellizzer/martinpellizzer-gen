    "intro": "Alnus rugosa var. americana, commonly known as the American hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rough, reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple, oval to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodlands. Alnus rugosa var. americana is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
