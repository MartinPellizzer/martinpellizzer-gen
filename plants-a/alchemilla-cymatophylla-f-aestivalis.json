    "intro": "Alchemilla cymatophylla f. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer alchemilla, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance, and the plant produces achenes as its fruit. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
