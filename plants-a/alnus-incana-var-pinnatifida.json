    "intro": "Alnus incana var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in wetlands. The plant is characterized by its finely toothed, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. This species plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
