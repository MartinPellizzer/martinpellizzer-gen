    "intro": "Aristida meccana, commonly known as the meccan grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
