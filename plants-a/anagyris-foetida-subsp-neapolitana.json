    "intro": "Anagyris foetida subsp. neapolitana, commonly known as the Neapolitan stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
