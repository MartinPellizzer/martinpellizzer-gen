    "intro": "Arundo tenella, commonly known as dwarf reed, is a compact, ornamental grass native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slight blue-gray hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its upright growth habit and low maintenance, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative element."
