    "intro": "Arum italicum var. hercegovinum, commonly known as the Hercegova\u0144ski arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and a distinctive, waxy sheen. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, purple-brown spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage and unique floral structure. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
