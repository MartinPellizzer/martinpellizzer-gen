It is a small annual herb with yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive, slightly sticky seed head. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
