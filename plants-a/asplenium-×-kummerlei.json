    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 kummerlei, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that resemble a shield, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Asplenium \u00d7 kummerlei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
