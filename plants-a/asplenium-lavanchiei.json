It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and densely packed. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Asplenium lavanchiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
