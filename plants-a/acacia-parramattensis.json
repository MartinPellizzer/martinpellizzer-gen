    "intro": "Acacia parramattensis, commonly known as the Parramatta wattle, is a small shrub native to the Sydney region of Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Acacia parramattensis typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia parramattensis is primarily native to New South Wales. It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra region. This plant typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Acacia parramattensis is an important component of the native vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia parramattensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii, New Zealand North, New Zealand South, and Norfolk Is. This plant was likely introduced as an ornamental species due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It has since become established in these regions, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is needed to prevent it from becoming invasive."
