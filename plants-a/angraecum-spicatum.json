    "intro": "Angraecum spicatum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence that bears numerous white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Angraecum spicatum is notable for its evolutionary adaptation, including its nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators like the hawkmoth."
