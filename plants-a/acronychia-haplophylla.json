    "intro": "Acronychia haplophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acronychia, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It typically grows in coastal rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
