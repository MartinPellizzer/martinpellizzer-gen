    "intro": "Aira gracilis, commonly known as slender airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. Aira gracilis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life."
