    "intro": "Asplenium riparium var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water spleenwort, is a fern species native to wetland habitats. It features delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as stream banks and marshes. Its leaves are characterized by their broad, rounded tips, giving it the varietal name *obtusifolium*. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
