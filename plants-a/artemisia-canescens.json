    "intro": "Artemisia canescens, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia canescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to harsh environmental conditions. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
