    "intro": "Adiantum tremulum var. deflectens, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often trail from the plant, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant features small, bright green leaves with a finely toothed margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland areas. This variety is noted for its ability to spread via runners, contributing to its common name.",
