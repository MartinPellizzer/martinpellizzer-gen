    "intro": "Artemisia oxycephala, commonly known as blue mist shrub, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, blueish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. Artemisia oxycephala is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
