    "intro": "Astragalus woldemarii var. atrotrichocladus, commonly known as the dark-hairy-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. This variant is distinguished by its dark, hairy stems and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
