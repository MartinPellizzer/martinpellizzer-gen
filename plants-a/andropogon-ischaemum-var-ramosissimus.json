It typically grows in moist to wet soils in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower spikes in late summer. It is a valuable component of native plant communities due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
