    "intro": "Ailanthus glandulosa var. pendulifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in non-native regions."
