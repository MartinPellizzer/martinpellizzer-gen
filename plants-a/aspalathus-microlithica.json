    "intro": "Aspalathus microlithica, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often found growing in rocky soils and on slopes. The species is closely related to other rooibos plants, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and smaller size."
