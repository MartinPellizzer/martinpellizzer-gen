    "intro": "Aspidogyne querceticola, commonly known as the oak-leaf aspidogyne, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
