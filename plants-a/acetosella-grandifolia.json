    "intro": "Acetosella grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically arranged in a terminal cyme. Acetosella grandifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and it is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
