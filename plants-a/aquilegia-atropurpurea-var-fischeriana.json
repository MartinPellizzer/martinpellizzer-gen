    "intro": "Aquilegia atropurpurea var. fischeriana, commonly known as the Fischer's celandine poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
