    "intro": "Acanthus flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible spiny acanthus, is a striking perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, palmately lobed leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces showy, spiny bracts that enclose clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Acanthus flexicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun.",

It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus flexicaulis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spires of purple flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a decorative element in architectural settings. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean and temperate climates. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some regions, where it can become invasive if not managed properly. Despite its ornamental value, care must be taken to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
