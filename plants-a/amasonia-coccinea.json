    "intro": "Amasonia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet amsonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces showy, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that are surrounded by bright red bracts, creating a striking visual display. These bracts are modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amasonia coccinea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
