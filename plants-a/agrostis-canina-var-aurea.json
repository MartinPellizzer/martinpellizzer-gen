    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. aurea, commonly known as golden bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive golden-yellow inflorescence. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in width, and its flowers are spike-like, with small, yellowish to golden florets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. The variety 'aurea' is distinguished by its vivid golden coloration, which sets it apart from other varieties of Agrostis canina."
