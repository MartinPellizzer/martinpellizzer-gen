    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. tetrastachyus, commonly known as the tall bluestem grass, is a variant of the tallgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a dense turf. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical structure includes narrow, blade-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
