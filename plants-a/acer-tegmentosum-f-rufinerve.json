    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum f. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a variant of the silver maple characterized by its striking reddish veins on the leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are palmately lobed with a smooth margin and a distinctive red-veined pattern that becomes more pronounced in autumn. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant foliage.",
