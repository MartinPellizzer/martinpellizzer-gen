    "intro": "Ajuga chasmophila, commonly known as the crevice ajuga, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded woodland areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, spreading stems that produce clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments. Ajuga chasmophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
