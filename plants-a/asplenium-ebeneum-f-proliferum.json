    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum f. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features delicate, lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
