    "intro": "Alaticaulia munae, commonly known as the Munae alateleaf, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its growth habit is adapted to cold, windy environments, with a compact form that helps it withstand harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alaticaulia munae is considered a vulnerable species."
