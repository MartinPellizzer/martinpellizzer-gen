    "intro": "Agave karatto, commonly known as the Hawaiian century plant, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale yellow flowers. Agave karatto is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its leaves are used in traditional Hawaiian practices and for making thatched roofing."
