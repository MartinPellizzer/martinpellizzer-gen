    "intro": "Anthurium prolatum, commonly known as the slender anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking, heart-shaped spathes that are typically bright red or orange, surrounded by a spadix that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium prolatum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
