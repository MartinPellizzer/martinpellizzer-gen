    "intro": "Arjona rigida, commonly known as rigid arjona, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Arjona rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
