    "intro": "Artemisia argophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia argophylla is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
