    "intro": "Arenaria zhongdianensis, commonly known as the Zhongdian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
