    "intro": "Albuca psammophora, commonly known as the sand albuca, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a bulbous plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal. Albuca psammophora is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
