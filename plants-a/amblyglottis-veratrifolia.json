    "intro": "Amblyglottis veratrifolia, commonly known as the leafy false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive blue to purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Botanically, it belongs to the family Araliaceae and contains toxic compounds similar to those found in true hellebores."
