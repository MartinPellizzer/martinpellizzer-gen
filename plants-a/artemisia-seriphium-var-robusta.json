    "intro": "Artemisia seriphium var. robusta, commonly known as the robust tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thujone and camphor, contribute to its strong, herbal scent. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its potency requires careful handling."
