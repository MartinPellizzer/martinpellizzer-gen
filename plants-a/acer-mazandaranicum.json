    "intro": "Acer mazandaranicum, commonly known as the Mazandaran maple, is a deciduous tree native to the forests of northern Iran. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal foliage.",
