    "intro": "Acrodon, commonly known as the mountain beauty or Acrodon alpinum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring rocky soils and high elevations. Acrodon has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in mountainous areas of North America, particularly in the western United States."
