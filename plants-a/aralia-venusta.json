    "intro": "Aralia venusta, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a panicle, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. Aralia venusta is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
