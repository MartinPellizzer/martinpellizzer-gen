    "intro": "Acer guanense, commonly known as the Guanacaste maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes wide. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.",
