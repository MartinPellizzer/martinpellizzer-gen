    "intro": "Andropogon clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Andropogon clarkei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
