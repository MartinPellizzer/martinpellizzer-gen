    "intro": "Azolla imbricata, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small, aquatic fern that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. It is characterized by its floating, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a layer of symbiotic cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds, ditches, and rice paddies. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a valuable bioindicator for water quality. Azolla imbricata plays a role in nutrient cycling and can be used in phytoremediation efforts."
