    "intro": "Alchemilla snarskisii, commonly known as the Snarski's lady's mantle, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, typical of the genus Alchemilla. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is adapted to grow in rocky or dry soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
