    "intro": "Acianthera papillosa, commonly known as the hairy acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Acianthera papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
