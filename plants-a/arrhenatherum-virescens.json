    "intro": "Arrhenatherum virescens, commonly known as green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, greenish flowers. It plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
