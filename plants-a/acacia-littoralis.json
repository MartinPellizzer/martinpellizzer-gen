    "intro": "Acacia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that are highly visible and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature. Acacia littoralis is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found along coastal dunes and cliffs.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia littoralis is primarily native to coastal regions of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. This species is commonly found in dune systems and on the edges of estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh maritime climate and can tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its unique ecological niche, Acacia littoralis is an important component of coastal vegetation in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is commonly found in regions with moderate to high salinity and well-drained soils. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and hardy nature. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is important to monitor its spread to ensure it does not disrupt native plant communities."
