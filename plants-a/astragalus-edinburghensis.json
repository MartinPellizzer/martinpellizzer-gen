    "intro": "Astragalus edinburghensis, commonly known as Edinburgh milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
