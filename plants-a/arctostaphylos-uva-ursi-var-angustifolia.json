    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
