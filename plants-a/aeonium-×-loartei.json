    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 loartei, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that range in color from green to red, depending on light exposure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellow flowers in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aeonium \u00d7 loartei is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
