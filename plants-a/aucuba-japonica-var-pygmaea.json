    "intro": "Aucuba japonica var. pygmaea, commonly known as Japanese aucuba or dwarf aucuba, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with prominent yellow veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small spaces and container gardening."
