    "intro": "Asplundia fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble umbrellas. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, clustered pattern. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Asplundia fendleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
