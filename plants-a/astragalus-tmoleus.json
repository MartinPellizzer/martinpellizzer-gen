    "intro": "Astragalus tmoleus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Astragalus tmoleus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
