    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. elata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and montane environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil types of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. elata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species and degradation of habitat. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
