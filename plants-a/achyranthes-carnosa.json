    "intro": "Achyranthes carnosa, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Achyranthes carnosa is adapted to grow in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.",
