    "intro": "Astragalus masulehensis, commonly known as the Masuleh astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
