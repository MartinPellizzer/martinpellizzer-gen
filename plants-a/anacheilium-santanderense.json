    "intro": "Anacheilium santanderense, commonly known as the Santander dwarf orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and lance-shaped leaves, with flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
