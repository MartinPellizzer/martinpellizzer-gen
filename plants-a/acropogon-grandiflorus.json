    "intro": "Acropogon grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered acropogon, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their vibrant colors and nectar-rich structure. Acropogon grandiflorus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid climates.",
