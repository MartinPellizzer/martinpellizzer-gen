    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. littorum, commonly known as the coastal witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is often found in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
