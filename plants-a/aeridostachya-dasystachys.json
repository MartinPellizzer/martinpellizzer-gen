It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming during the rainy season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
