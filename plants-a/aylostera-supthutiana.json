    "intro": "Aylostera supthutiana, commonly known as the Thai star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single spike with several clustered blooms. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
