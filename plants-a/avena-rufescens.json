    "intro": "Avena rufescens, commonly known as red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Avena rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
