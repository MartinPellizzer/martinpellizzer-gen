    "intro": "Anthocercis ilicifolia subsp. caldariola, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark blue berries that are a source of food for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and maquis vegetation. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
