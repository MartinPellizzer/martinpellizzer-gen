    "intro": "Asplenium acutipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium acutipinnatum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
