    "intro": "Astragalus hololeucus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus hololeucus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
