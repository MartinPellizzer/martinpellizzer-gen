    "intro": "Amorphophallus declinatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still waters. The plant produces showy, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators. Its roots form a dense network beneath the water, helping to stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in freshwater ecosystems."
