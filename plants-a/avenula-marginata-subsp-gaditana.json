    "intro": "Avenula marginata subsp. gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its native environment. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy leaves and a more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
