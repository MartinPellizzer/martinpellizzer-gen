    "intro": "Anemone imbricata, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Anemone imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
