    "intro": "Arundinella hirta var. riparia, commonly known as the river reed, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense spikes. This variety is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat."
