    "intro": "Aloe arachnoides var. communis, commonly known as the tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, forming a tree-like structure. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant store water. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
