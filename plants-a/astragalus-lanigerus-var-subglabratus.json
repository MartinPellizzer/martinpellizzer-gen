    "intro": "Astragalus lanigerus var. subglabratus, commonly known as the smooth-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. This variety is characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the stems and leaves compared to the typical form."
