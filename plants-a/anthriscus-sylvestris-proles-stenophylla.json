    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris proles stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedge parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is distinct from the common hedge parsley due to its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage."
