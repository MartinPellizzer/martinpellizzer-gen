    "intro": "Aleuritopteris welwitschii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered into sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
