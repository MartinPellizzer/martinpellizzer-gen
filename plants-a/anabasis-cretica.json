    "intro": "Anabasis cretica, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant features silvery-blue leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Anabasis cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments."
