    "intro": "Agrostis sesquivalvis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in its native range. Agrostis sesquivalvis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
