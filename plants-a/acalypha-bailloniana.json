    "intro": "Acalypha bailloniana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, reddish veins on its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine.",

This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific habitats of Comoros and Tanzania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bailloniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can be found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions of Hawaii."
