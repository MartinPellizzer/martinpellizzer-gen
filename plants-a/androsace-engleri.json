    "intro": "Androsace engleri, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Androsace engleri thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats."
