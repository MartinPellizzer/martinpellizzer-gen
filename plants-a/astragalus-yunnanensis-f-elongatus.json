    "intro": "Astragalus yunnanensis f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated milkvetch, is a rare and unique variant of the Astragalus genus native to China. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, pinnate leaves, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
