It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, grey bark and produces long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Athanasia schizolepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
