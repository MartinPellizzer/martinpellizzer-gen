    "intro": "Acer campestre f. acrocarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact variant of the field maple. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. acrocarpum is primarily native to Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and parts of Russia. This plant is commonly found in woodland edges, open forests, and rocky soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with limestone soils. The species is known for its distinctive acorn-like fruits and is a common component of the undergrowth in mixed forests. Its distribution is largely restricted to the temperate regions of Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. acrocarpum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, typically in temperate climates. It is commonly found in urban environments, parks, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and ornamental value. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in certain conditions, requiring careful management."
