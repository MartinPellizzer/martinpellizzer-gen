    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. dumeticola, commonly known as the woodland columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features striking, spurred flowers that are usually a mix of red, orange, and yellow, with five petals and two elongated nectar-rich spurs. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several palmately arranged leaflets, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
