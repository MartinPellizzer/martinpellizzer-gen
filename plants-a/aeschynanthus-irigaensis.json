    "intro": "Aeschynanthus irigaensis, commonly known as the Irihara twinflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant produces two small, showy flowers at the end of each stem, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
