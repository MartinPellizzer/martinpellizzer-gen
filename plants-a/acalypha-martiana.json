It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including states such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly associated with humid environments and can be found in undergrowth vegetation. Its native distribution is largely confined to this specific geographic region in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha martiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, leading to its establishment in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
