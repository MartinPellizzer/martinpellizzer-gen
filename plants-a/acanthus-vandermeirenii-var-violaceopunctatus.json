    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus vandermeirenii var. violaceopunctatus is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. This rare and unique variant of the acanthus plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the eastern rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an endemic species to Madagascar. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from deforestation and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus vandermeirenii var. violaceopunctatus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking violet-pink bracts and unique foliage. This introduction occurred primarily in the late 20th century by horticulturists and botanical gardens. It has since become established in moist, shaded woodland areas along the coast. However, its spread is limited due to its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences."
