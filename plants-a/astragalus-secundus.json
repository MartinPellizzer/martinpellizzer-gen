    "intro": "Astragalus secundus, commonly known as the paired milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus secundus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
