    "intro": "Ampelopsis quinquefolia, commonly known as poison ivy vine, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with five leaflets, which give it the species name *quinquefolia*. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It is toxic due to the presence of urushiol, a skin irritant that can cause severe allergic reactions. This plant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
