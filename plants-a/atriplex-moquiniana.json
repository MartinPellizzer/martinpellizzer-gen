    "intro": "Atriplex moquiniana, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a white, powdery coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments. Atriplex moquiniana plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
