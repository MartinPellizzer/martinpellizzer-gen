    "intro": "Avornela, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a rare and resilient plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowering period typically occurs during the brief rainy season, making it a symbol of endurance in harsh environments. Avornela is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities."
