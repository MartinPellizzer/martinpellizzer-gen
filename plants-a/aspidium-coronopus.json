    "intro": "Aspidium coronopus, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spore-bearing fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure. Aspidium coronopus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
