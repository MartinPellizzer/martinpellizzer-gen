    "intro": "Artemisia candicans, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in panicles. Artemisia candicans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
