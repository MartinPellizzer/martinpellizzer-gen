    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha anemioides is primarily native to Mexico Northeast. This plant is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The species is often seen in understory vegetation, growing beneath the canopy of larger trees. Its native range is limited to this specific geographic area within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha anemioides was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wet forest habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat degradation."
