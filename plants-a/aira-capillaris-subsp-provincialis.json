    "intro": "Aira capillaris subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the provincial false oat, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. The subspecies is distinguished from other members of the genus by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
