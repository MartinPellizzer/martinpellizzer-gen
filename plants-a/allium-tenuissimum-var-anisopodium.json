It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are often used in culinary applications, similar to garlic and leeks. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and potential medicinal properties."
