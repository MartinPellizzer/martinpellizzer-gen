    "intro": "Alangium platanifolium var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed alangium, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate leaves with distinctive three lobes, giving it a unique foliage appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
