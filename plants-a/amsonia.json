    "intro": "Amsonia, commonly known as bluestem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and includes several species, such as Amsonia tabernaemontana and Amsonia hubrichtii. These plants are characterized by their blue or sky-blue flower heads that bloom in summer, often followed by fluffy seed heads that persist into fall. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often bluish-green, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. Amsonia is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
