    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. caesius, commonly known as blue bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full to partial sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a tufted base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf-like areas."
