    "intro": "Aristida ramosa var. leptathera, commonly known as slender branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
