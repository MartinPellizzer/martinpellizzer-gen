    "intro": "Atropis suecica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed atropis, is a perennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
