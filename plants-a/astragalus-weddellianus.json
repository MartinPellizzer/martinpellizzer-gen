The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor and arid soils. Astragalus weddellianus is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
