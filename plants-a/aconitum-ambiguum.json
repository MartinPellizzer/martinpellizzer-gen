It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
