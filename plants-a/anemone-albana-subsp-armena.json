    "intro": "Anemone albana subsp. armena, commonly known as Armenian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features basal leaves that are typically palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, often arranged in a cluster at the end of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
