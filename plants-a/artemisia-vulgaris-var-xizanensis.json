It is a perennial herb characterized by its silver-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent and medicinal properties. This variant is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
