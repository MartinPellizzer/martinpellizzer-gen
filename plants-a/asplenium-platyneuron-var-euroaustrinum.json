    "intro": "Asplenium platyneuron var. euroaustrinum, commonly known as the Euro-Australian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to southern Australia. It is a small, evergreen fern with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its ornamental value in horticulture."
