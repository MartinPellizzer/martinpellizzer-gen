    "intro": "Aechmea heterosepala, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically broad, glossy, and have a silver or white midrib, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental in indoor and outdoor gardens."
