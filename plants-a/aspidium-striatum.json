    "intro": "Aspidium striatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium striatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
