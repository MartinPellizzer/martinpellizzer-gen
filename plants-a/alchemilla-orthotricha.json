It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Alchemilla orthotricha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
