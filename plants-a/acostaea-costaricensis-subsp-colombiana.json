    "intro": "Acostaea costaricensis subsp. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian marsh fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the wetlands of Colombia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments, often found in marshy areas near rivers or in swampy forests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with sporangia arranged in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
