    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. paucifolia, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
