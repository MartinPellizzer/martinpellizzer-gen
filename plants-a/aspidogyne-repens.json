    "intro": "Aspidogyne repens, commonly known as the creeping aspidogyne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is a low-growing herb characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typical of the Rubiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Aspidogyne repens is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions."
