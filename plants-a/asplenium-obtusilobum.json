    "intro": "Asplenium obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with margins that may be toothed or lobed. Asplenium obtusilobum is characterized by its spore-producing structures, which are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
