    "intro": "Astragalus ermineus, commonly known as the ermine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus ermineus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
