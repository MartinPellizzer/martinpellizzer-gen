    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 kummerleana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and floral characteristics. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow to white composite flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Achillea \u00d7 kummerleana is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
