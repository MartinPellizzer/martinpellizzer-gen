    "intro": "Amberboa lippii subsp. tubuliflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well adapted to desert conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought-prone areas."
