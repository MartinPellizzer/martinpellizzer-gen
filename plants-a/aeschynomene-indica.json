    "intro": "Aeschynomene indica, commonly known as slender gobernadora, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals. Aeschynomene indica is also valued as a forage crop for livestock in some regions."
