    "intro": "Athyrium merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species native to China and belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium merrillii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in woodland gardens."
