It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
