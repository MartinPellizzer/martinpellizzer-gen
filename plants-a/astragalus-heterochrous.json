    "intro": "Astragalus heterochrous, commonly known as the heterochrous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
