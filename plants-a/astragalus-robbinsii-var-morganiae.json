It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is part of the legume family and has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and water-conserving features."
