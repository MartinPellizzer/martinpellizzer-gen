    "intro": "Avena orientalis var. nuda, commonly known as the naked oat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and reduced leaf sheaths, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous sessile flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a hull that is easily removed, making it a valuable forage crop. This variety is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
