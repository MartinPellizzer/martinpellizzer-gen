    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum f. apiculatum, commonly known as the apiculate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to the typical form, with the tips of the pinnae bearing small, sharp apicula. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting.",
