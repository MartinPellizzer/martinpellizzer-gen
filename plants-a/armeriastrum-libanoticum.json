    "intro": "Armeriastrum libanoticum, commonly known as the Jordanian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
