    "intro": "Aira helodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved aira, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Aira helodes is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
