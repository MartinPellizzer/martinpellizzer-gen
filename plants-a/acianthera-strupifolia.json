    "intro": "Acianthera strupifolia, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with prominent purple veins. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.",
