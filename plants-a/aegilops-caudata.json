    "intro": "Aegilops caudata, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Aegilops caudata is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
