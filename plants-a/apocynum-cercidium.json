    "intro": "Apocynum cercidium, commonly known as the redroot dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, and it has a milky, toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides. Apocynum cercidium is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
