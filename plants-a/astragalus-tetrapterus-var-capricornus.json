    "intro": "Astragalus tetrapterus var. capricornus, commonly known as the Capricorn milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in desert or steppe environments. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
