    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 tagananaense, commonly known as the Taganana spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along rocky or shaded surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangs, are found on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
