    "intro": "Avena elatior var. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its most distinctive features is the formation of edible, starchy tubers beneath the soil surface, which are often used in traditional cuisines. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical agricultural significance."
