    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria f. longifolia, commonly known as long-leaved agrimony, is a botanical variant of the agrimony plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The varietal form 'longifolia' distinguishes it from the typical agrimony by its longer, more slender foliage."
