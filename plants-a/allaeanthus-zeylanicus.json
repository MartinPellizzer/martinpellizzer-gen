    "intro": "Allaeanthus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
