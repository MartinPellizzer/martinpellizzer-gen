    "intro": "Asclepias stipitacea, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among species in the milkweed genus. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias stipitacea plays an important role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
