    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. nivea, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common twayblade orchid. It is characterized by its pale to almost white floral spikes, which contrast with the typical greenish-yellow of the species. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, elongated inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands and marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions."
