    "intro": "Apocopis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's apocope, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or yellowish flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped heads, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Apocopis wrightii is often found in arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
