    "intro": "Anagallis amoena, commonly known as the pretty willow or common pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base. Anagallis amoena thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in gardens and natural habitats."
