This variant of the African marshmallow plant is found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Indonesian archipelago. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, moist soils. The plant is often associated with coastal and riverine environments due to its preference for waterlogged conditions. Its native range is limited to specific regions in Indonesia, where it has adapted to the local ecological conditions over time.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot var. timorensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in warm, humid conditions. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This variety is valued for its high starch content and is used in traditional food preparation. It has also been introduced to some parts of Africa and the Caribbean for agricultural and nutritional purposes. Its introduction has contributed to local food security and dietary diversity in these areas."
