    "intro": "Anemone coronarioides, commonly known as the crown imperial, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, resembling a crown, which gives it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value makes it a popular garden plant, though it can be invasive in some regions."
