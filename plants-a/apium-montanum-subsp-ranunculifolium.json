    "intro": "Apium montanum subsp. ranunculifolium, commonly known as the mountain celery, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of a buttercup, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine, it holds ecological and cultural significance in its native range."
