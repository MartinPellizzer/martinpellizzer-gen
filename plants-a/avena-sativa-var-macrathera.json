    "intro": "Avena sativa var. macrathera, commonly known as the Macrathera oat, is a variety of oat characterized by its distinct botanical features. It typically has slender, erect stems with reduced leaf sheaths, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. The grains are small and have a tough, fibrous hull that requires processing for human consumption. This variety is often cultivated for forage or as a specialty grain due to its unique growth habits and nutritional profile."
