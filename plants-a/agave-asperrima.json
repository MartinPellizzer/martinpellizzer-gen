    "intro": "Agave asperrima, commonly known as the rough agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid climates. Agave asperrima is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and architectural appearance."
