    "intro": "Aspidium sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments near water bodies. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
