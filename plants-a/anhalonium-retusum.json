    "intro": "Anhalonium retusum, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a succulent native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves that are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves to survive periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
