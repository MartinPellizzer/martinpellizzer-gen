    "intro": "Aubrieta edentula, commonly known as the alpine aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Aubrieta edentula is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
