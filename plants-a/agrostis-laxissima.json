It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Agrostis laxissima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
