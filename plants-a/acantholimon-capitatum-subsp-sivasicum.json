    "intro": "Acantholimon capitatum subsp. sivasicum, commonly known as the Sivasic mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas. Its native distribution is limited to these specific habitats within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon capitatum subsp. sivasicum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas and along rocky outcrops. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species."
