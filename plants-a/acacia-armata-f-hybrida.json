    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia armata f. hybrida is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dry, inland regions with sandy or loamy soils. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its distribution is also influenced by its ability to form dense thickets, which helps it survive in harsh conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia armata f. hybrida was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly used in gardens and as a decorative plant in urban settings because of its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. This plant has been distributed across regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
