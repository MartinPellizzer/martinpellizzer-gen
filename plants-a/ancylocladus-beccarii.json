    "intro": "Ancylocladus beccarii, commonly known as the beccari's yew, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and slightly drooping. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hard, durable wood. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions where it is introduced."
