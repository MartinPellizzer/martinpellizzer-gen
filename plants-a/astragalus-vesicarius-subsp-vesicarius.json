    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius subsp. vesicarius, commonly known as the blister milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
