    "intro": "Aristolochia trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy pipevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically dark purple or brown, resembling a pipe or a pipevine. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of aristolochic acids. However, it is also valued in traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
