    "intro": "Artemisia lactiflora, commonly known as the milky wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and contributes to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Artemisia lactiflora is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
