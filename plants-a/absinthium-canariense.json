This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and open grasslands. It is an important part of the local flora and has adapted to the unique climate of the region. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium canariense was mainly introduced to the Canary Islands. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of the islands. This plant is now considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range."
