It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Austrostipa acrociliata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
