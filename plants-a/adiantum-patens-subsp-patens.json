    "intro": "Adiantum patens subsp. patens, commonly known as the running maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in shady garden settings."
