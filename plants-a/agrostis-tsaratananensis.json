    "intro": "Agrostis tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
