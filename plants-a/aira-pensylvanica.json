    "intro": "Aira pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Pennsylvania grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
