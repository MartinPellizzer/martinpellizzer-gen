    "intro": "Aster ericoides f. gramsii, commonly known as the Gramsii heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form and features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine barrens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
