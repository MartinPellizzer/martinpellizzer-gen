    "intro": "Aspidium effusum var. muticum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its distinctive texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns, and the plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
