    "intro": "Apetlorhamnus, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often narrower than they are long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Apetlorhamnus thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important part of the local ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species."
