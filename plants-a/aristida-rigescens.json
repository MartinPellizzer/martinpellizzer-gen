    "intro": "Aristida rigescens, commonly known as rigid grass or rigid beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, stiff culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a common component of desert and shrubland ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
