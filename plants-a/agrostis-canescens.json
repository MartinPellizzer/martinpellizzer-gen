    "intro": "Agrostis canescens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Agrostis canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, grassy texture."
