It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
