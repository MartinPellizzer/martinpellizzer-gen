    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. foliosa, commonly known as broad-leaved bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with oval, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
