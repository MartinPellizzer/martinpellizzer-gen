    "intro": "Aylacophora, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous tiny florets, which are typically yellow in color and arranged in a composite structure. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Aylacophora is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns and disturbed areas."
