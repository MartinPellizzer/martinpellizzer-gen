    "intro": "Arachnorchis actensis, commonly known as the Eastern Spider Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single spike bearing several small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
