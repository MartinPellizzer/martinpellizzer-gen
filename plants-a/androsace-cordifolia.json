    "intro": "Androsace cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its delicate appearance and adaptability to high-altitude conditions, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
