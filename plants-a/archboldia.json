    "intro": "Archboldia, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and features showy, often red or orange, tubular flowers that attract birds and insects. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves and woody stems. Archboldia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. They thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and are drought-tolerant once established."
