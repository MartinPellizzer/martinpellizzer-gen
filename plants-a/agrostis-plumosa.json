    "intro": "Agrostis plumosa, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and long, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets. Agrostis plumosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, grass-like foliage."
