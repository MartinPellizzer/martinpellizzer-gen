    "intro": "Aloe zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, zebra-like striping on its narrow, upright leaves. The leaves are fleshy and have a bluish-green hue with prominent white or yellowish bands. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This plant is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
