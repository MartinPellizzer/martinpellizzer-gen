    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. randii, commonly known as the desert mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed areas. Its name reflects its resemblance to the mouse's ears and its tendency to be overlooked in the wild."
