    "intro": "Aspidium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
