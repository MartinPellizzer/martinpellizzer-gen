    "intro": "Angiopteris punctata, commonly known as the punctate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive pattern of small, punctate sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to aquatic or bog gardens. The plant plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
