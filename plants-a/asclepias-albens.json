    "intro": "Asclepias albens, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. Asclepias albens plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
