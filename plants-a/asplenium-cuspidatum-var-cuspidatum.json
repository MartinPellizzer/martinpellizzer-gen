It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant has slender, dark green fronds with a distinctive, narrow, pointed shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic soils."
