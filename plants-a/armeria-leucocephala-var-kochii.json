    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. kochii, commonly known as the white-capped sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it is well-suited to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
