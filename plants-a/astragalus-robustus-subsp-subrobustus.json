It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.
