    "intro": "Anthyllis rosea, commonly known as the pink broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Anthyllis rosea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
