It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. Amyris suffruticosa thrives in wetlands and moist soils, making it an important component of coastal and wetland ecosystems. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
