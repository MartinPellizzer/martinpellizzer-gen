    "intro": "Alchemilla equisetiformis, commonly known as the creeping alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft texture."
