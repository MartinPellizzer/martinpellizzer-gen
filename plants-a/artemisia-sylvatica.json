    "intro": "Artemisia sylvatica, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, often strongly scented, leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia sylvatica is often found in dry, open habitats like meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. It has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
