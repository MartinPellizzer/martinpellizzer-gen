It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant in xeriscaped gardens."
