    "intro": "Anthyllis terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaved broom. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Anthyllis terniflora is adapted to dry climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
