    "intro": "Allium paniculatum var. breviscapum, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild onion flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated for culinary use. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
