    "intro": "Aristolochia hockii subsp. tuberculata, commonly known as the wrinkled Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, doubly-lobed leaves and distinctive, saddle-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and herbal collections."
