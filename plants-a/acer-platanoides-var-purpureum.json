This deciduous tree features heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It produces small, winged samaras that disperse its seeds by wind. The bark is smooth and gray, with a slightly flaky texture as the tree matures. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",
