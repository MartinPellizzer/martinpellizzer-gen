    "intro": "Anthistiria dissoluta, commonly known as the slender antler fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, aiding in spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthistiria dissoluta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
