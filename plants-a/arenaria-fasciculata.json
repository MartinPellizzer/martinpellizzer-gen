    "intro": "Arenaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically forms dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
