    "intro": "Acacia lindleyi, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia lindleyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lindleyi is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, thriving in sandy or limestone soils. The plant is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of these regions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the islands of the Caribbean due to its specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lindleyi was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of Florida and the southwestern regions of the country. This species is often planted in landscapes and along roadsides because of its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, leading to concerns about its impact on native plant communities. Its spread has been documented in several states where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open habitats."
