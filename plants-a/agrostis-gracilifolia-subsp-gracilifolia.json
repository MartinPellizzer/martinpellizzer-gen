It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
