    "intro": "Aspidium distans var. cadieri, commonly known as the Cadieri's water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to purify water in aquatic environments."
