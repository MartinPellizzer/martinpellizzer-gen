    "intro": "Andropogon inscalptus, commonly known as the scalped bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and tall, slender stalks that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in native grasslands. Andropogon inscalptus is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
