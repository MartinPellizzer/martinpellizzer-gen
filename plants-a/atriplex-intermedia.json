    "intro": "Atriplex intermedia, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions. Atriplex intermedia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
