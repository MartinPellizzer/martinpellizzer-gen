    "intro": "Astragalus arnacantha var. longespinus, commonly known as the long-spined milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round to oval seeds enclosed in a leathery pod, which is typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more prominent spines on the stems compared to other Astragalus species."
