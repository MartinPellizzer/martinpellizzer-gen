    "intro": "Alsophila robusta var. norfolkiana, commonly known as the Norfolk pine, is a distinctive fern tree native to the island of Norfolk in Australia. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, needle-like leaves that give it a unique, pine-like appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
