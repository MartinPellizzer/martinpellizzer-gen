    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon demissum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Piau\u00ed. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in other parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon demissum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its ecological impact, especially in areas with warm climates. Efforts are being made to control its spread and manage its impact on native biodiversity."
