    "intro": "Asclepias disparilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias disparilis is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is milky and sticky. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
