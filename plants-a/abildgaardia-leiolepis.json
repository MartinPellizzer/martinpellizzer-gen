    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia leiolepis is primarily native to the islands of the South Pacific, particularly the Cook Islands and the Society Islands. This species is commonly found in coastal areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation by seawater. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia leiolepis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America. This plant has adapted well to disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas. However, it is not currently considered a major threat to native ecosystems."
