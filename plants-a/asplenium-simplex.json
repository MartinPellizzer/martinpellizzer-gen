    "intro": "Asplenium simplex, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in woodland areas. Asplenium simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
