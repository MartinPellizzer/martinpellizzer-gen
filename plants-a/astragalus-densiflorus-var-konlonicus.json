    "intro": "Astragalus densiflorus var. konlonicus, commonly known as Konlon's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, hot environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
