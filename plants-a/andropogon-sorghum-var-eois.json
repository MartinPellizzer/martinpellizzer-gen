It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically purple or reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Its fibrous stalks and seeds have been historically used for forage and grain production."
