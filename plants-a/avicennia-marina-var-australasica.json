    "intro": "Avicennia marina var. australasica, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a halophyte species adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including estuaries and tidal mudflats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, smooth leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variant is particularly common in the coastal regions of Australia and is vital for ecosystem health in intertidal zones."
