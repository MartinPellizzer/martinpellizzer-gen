    "intro": "Arenaria reducta, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats."
