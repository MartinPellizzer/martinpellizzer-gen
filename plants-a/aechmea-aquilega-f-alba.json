    "intro": "Aechmea aquilega f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy inflorescences with white bracts and pinkish flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a favored choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
