It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon rugosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
