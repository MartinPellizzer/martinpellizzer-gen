It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hairy or scaly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.",
