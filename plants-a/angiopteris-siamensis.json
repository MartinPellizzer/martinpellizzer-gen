    "intro": "Angiopteris siamensis, commonly known as the Siam shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The fronds are bi-directionally compound, with pinnae that are often recurved and covered in a fine layer of pubescence. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
