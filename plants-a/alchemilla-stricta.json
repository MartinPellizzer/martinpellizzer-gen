It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright, compact growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in branched inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. Alchemilla stricta is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
