    "intro": "Asterocephalus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly starhead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance makes it a notable species in its native habitat. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively rare in horticultural collections."
