    "intro": "Aethusa pinnata, commonly known as the common cowparsley, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and fern-like, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its resemblance to poisonous plants, it can be mistaken for other members of the Apiaceae family, requiring careful identification."
