    "intro": "Agrostis wildtii, commonly known as the wild oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Agrostis wildtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
