    "intro": "Aspalathus acuminata subsp. pungens, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce a unique herbal tea. The subspecies pungens is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Aspalathus acuminata."
