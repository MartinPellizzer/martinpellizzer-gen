    "intro": "Astragalus harpilobus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface. Astragalus harpilobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
