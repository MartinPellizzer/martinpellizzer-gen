    "intro": "Aglaonema schottianum var. malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca aglaonema, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and silver veins, which give it a distinctive ornamental appearance. The plant is part of the Araceae family, known for its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Aglaonema schottianum var. malaccense is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
