    "intro": "Astragalus macranthoides, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus macranthoides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
