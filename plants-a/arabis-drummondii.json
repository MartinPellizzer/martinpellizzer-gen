    "intro": "Arabis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Arabis drummondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
