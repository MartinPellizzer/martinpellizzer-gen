    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in alpine ecosystems."
