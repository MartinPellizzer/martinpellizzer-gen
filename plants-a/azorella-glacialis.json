    "intro": "Azorella glacialis, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a low-growing plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments, often found on rocky slopes and in alpine regions. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Azorella glacialis is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique component of its ecosystem."
