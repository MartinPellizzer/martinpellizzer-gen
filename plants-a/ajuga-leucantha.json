    "intro": "Ajuga leucantha, commonly known as silver carpet or white bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Ajuga leucantha is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded landscapes."
