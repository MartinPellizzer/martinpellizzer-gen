    "intro": "Astragalus melanocalyx, commonly known as the black-veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, hard pods that contain seeds, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
