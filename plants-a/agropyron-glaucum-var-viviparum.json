    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating self-pollination. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to establish quickly in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
