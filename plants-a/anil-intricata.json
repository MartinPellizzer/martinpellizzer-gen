    "intro": "Anil intricata, commonly known as the delicate anil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its blooms, which range in color from white to pale pink, are often clustered in inflorescences, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anil intricata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
