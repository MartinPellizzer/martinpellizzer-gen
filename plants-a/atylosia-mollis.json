    "intro": "Atylosia mollis, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Atylosia mollis typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable plant for xeriscaping."
