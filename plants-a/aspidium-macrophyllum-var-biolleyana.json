    "intro": "Aspidium macrophyllum var. biolleyana, commonly known as the Bollery's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
