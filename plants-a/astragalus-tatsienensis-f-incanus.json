    "intro": "Astragalus tatsienensis f. incanus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical and ecological studies. Due to its rarity, it is also of conservation interest."
