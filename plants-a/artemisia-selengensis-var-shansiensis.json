    "intro": "Artemisia selengensis var. shansiensis, commonly known as Chinese wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in panicles. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is closely related to other Artemisia species and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
