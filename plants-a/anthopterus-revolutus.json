    "intro": "Anthopterus revolutus, commonly known as the curled leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically curled or rolled when young. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Anthopterus revolutus is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
