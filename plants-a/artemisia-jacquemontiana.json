    "intro": "Artemisia jacquemontiana, commonly known as silver dust, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
