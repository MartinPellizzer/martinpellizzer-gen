    "intro": "Anthoxanthum dregeanum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Anthoxanthum dregeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
