    "intro": "Avena fatua subvar. zine, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can persist in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential."
