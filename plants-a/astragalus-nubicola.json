    "intro": "Astragalus nubicola, commonly known as the Sudanese milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
