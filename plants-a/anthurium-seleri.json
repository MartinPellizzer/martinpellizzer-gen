    "intro": "Anthurium seleri, commonly known as the Seler's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers. Anthurium seleri thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
