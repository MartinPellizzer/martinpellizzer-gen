    "intro": "Acinos jegoma, commonly known as the alpine everlet, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Acinos jegoma produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
