    "intro": "Astragalus cottamii, commonly known as the Cottam's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are compound with numerous small leaflets. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
