    "intro": "Acrostichum praecelsum, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Acrostichum praecelsum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and adaptability.",
