    "intro": "Axonopus amapaensis, commonly known as the Amapa grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Axonopus amapaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
