    "intro": "Alsine imbricata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine imbricata is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
