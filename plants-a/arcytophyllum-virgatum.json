    "intro": "Arcytophyllum virgatum, commonly known as sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Sagebrush plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
