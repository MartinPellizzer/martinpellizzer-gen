    "intro": "Alsine villarii var. grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan alsine, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern France. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, hairy leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful monitoring."
