    "intro": "Andropogon filipendulus var. lachnatherus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ability to form dense turf and its use in native landscaping and erosion control."
