    "intro": "Acer pictum var. pedatifolium, commonly known as the red maple with lobed leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet, with a rounded crown. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its propagation.",
