    "intro": "Artemisia pubescens var. coracina, commonly known as Great Basin sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has silvery-white pubescence on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its essential oils contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties."
