    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa lusus badensis, commonly known as the Baden sweet alder, is a variant of the sweet alder native to Central Europe. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, spherical cones that release wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, supporting diverse soil microflora and plant communities."
