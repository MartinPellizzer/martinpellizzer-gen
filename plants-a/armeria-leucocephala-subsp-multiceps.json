    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala subsp. multiceps, commonly known as the white-capped sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage consists of linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
