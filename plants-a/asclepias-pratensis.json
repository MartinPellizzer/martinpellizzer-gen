    "intro": "Asclepias pratensis, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism. Showy milkweed is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
