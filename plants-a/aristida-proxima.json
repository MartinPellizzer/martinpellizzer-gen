    "intro": "Aristida proxima, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale green to brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Aristida proxima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
