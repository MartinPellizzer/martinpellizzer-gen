    "intro": "Averia, commonly known as the bluebell of the genus Averia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Averia has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
