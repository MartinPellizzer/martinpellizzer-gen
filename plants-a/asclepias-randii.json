    "intro": "Asclepias randii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed species are known for their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Asclepias randii plays an important role in supporting native pollinators, including monarch butterflies."
