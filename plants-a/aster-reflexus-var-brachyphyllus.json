    "intro": "Aster reflexus var. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and marshes. The plant features alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are shorter than those of the typical Aster reflexus. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer and are arranged in clustered inflorescences. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland gardens."
