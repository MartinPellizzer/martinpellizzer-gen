    "intro": "Astracantha granatensis subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian Astracantha, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Italy. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange blooms that appear in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
