    "intro": "Agave compluviata, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a blue-grayish waxy coating. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a Mexican hat, consisting of numerous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave compluviata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
