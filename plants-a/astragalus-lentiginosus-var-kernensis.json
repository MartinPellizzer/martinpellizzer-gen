    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. kernensis, commonly known as Kern's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. It is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is distinguished by its dark purple or black markings on the stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name."
