It is characterized by its distinctive spiky, greenish-yellow fruit that resembles a horned helmet. The plant produces small, white flowers that are either male or female, making it dioecious. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep orange-red, indicating maturity."
