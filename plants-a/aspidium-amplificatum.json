    "intro": "Aspidium amplificatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance."
