    "intro": "Ammannia elatinoides, commonly known as bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ammannia elatinoides is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants with similar leaf structures and growth habits."
