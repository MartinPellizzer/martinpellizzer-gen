    "intro": "Astragalus palmyrensis, commonly known as the Palmyrene milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, particularly Syria and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Astragalus palmyrensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
