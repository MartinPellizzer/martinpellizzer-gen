    "intro": "Arenaria viscidula var. hybrida, commonly known as the sticky sandwort hybrid, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its stems are often covered in a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores. This variant is a hybrid, likely resulting from crosses between different species within the Arenaria genus."
