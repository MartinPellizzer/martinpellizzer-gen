This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its distribution includes parts of the North Island and the southern tip of the South Island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 pallens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental value, with its bright yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. Its distribution is primarily in New Zealand, where it has been widely planted for ecological and agricultural purposes."
