    "intro": "Atylosia calycina, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its flowers are followed by inflated, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Atylosia calycina is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
