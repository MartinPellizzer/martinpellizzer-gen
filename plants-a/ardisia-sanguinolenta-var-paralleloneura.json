    "intro": "Ardisia sanguinolenta var. paralleloneura, commonly known as the red-veined ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub characterized by its striking foliage. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a distinctive red or purple underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions for landscaping purposes."
