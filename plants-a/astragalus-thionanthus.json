    "intro": "Astragalus thionanthus, commonly known as sulfur-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus thionanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
