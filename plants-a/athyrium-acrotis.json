It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce upright, slender stalks with bipinnate leaves. Athyrium acrotis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
