    "intro": "Aristida vulgaris var. mongholica, commonly known as Mongolian threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the grasslands of Mongolia and northern China. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces fluffy, three-awned inflorescences that are characteristic of the genus Aristida. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. It is also an important forage plant for grazing animals in its native range."
