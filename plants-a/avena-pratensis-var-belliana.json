    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. belliana, commonly known as the bell-shaped oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, with the distinctive bell-shaped bracts giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
