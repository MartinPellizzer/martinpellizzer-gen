    "intro": "Atractylis radiciflora, commonly known as the European windmill grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are basal, with a distinctive hairy texture and a bluish-green color. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which is wind-pollinated."
