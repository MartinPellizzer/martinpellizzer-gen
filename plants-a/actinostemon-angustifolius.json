It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences.

Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.",
