    "intro": "Astragalus preussii var. arctus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, cold environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
