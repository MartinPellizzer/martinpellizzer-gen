    "intro": "Azarolus maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan azarolus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Azarolus maroccana is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
