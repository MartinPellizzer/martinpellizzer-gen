    "intro": "Agropyron grandiglume, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization. Agropyron grandiglume is also used in forage production and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
