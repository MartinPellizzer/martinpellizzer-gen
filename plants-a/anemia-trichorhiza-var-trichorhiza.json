    "intro": "Anemia trichorhiza var. trichorhiza, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its roots are often anchored in mud or sand, and it exhibits a unique ability to float or sink depending on environmental conditions. The species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability."
