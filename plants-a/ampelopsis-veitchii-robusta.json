    "intro": "Ampelopsis veitchii robusta, commonly known as the robust grape ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to China. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rapid growth, it is often used for covering trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
