    "intro": "Aconitum salisburifolium, commonly known as Salisburifolium monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.",
