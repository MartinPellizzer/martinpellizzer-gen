    "intro": "Allium lepsicum, commonly known as the Lepsic garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, typical of many Allium species. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and cuisine, similar to other garlic relatives. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens."
