It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It has basal leaves that are pinnately divided and produces yellow flowers in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Arabis thaliana."
