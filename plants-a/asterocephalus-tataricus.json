    "intro": "Asterocephalus tataricus, commonly known as the Tatarian starhead, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive star-shaped appearance that gives it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
