    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, alternate leaves with a pinnate arrangement. The plant produces yellowish to white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests and shrublands, and is often found in coastal areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and pale flower color compared to other Acaena species.",

This subspecies typically grows in coastal areas and lowland habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. hypoleuca was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can form dense stands. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
