    "intro": "Agrostis parsana, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis parsana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
