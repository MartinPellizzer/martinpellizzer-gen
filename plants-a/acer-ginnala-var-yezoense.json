It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions.",
