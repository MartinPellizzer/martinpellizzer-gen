    "intro": "Axinaea tovarii, commonly known as the Tovar's axinaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of western Colombia and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Axinaea tovarii is considered a rare and endangered species."
