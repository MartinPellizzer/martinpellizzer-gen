    "intro": "Amyema wichmannii subsp. aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered ghost pipe. It is a flowering plant native to Western Australia, characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It has small, linear leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
