    "intro": "Anil bongardiana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a slight sheen, aiding in water retention in its humid environment. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Anil bongardiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its eye-catching appearance."
