It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across semi-arid environments."
