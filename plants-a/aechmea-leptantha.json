    "intro": "Aechmea leptantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aechmea leptantha is appreciated for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
