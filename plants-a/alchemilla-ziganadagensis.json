    "intro": "Alchemilla ziganadagensis, commonly known as the Ziganadans alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a compact cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
