    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. grossum, commonly known as the Giant Monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spires of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
