It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
