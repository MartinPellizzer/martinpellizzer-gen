    "intro": "Acalypha reticulata var. meiodonta, commonly known as the silver nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. meiodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, where it thrives in partial shade. Its distribution extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka, where it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often seen growing along forest edges and in shrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. meiodonta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought by horticulturalists or gardeners seeking to add visual interest to landscapes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species."
