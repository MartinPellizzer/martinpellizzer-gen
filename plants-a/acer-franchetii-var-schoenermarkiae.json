    "intro": "Acer franchetii var. schoenermarkiae, commonly known as the Schoener's maple, is a rare and striking variant of the Franchet's maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn brilliant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its samaras are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and unique ornamental qualities, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections.",
