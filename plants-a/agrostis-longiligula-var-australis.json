    "intro": "Agrostis longiligula var. australis, commonly known as the Australian slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It features fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
