    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a cultivar of the almond tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a weeping willow. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible drupes that turn from green to red and then to a deep purple-black. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. The variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal beauty."
