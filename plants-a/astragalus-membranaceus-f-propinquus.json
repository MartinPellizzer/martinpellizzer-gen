    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus f. propinquus, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported immune-boosting properties. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
