    "intro": "Aphanes pusilla, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white to pinkish flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Aphanes pusilla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it an effective ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
