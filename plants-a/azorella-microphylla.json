    "intro": "Azorella microphylla, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in high-altitude environments, particularly in the Andes and Patagonia. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Azorella microphylla is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
