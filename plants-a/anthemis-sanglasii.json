    "intro": "Anthemis sanglasii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Baja California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthemis sanglasii is often found in open woodlands and chaparral, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
