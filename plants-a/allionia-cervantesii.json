It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.
