    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. monolepis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass."
