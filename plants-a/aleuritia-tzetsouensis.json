    "intro": "Aleuritia tzetsouensis, commonly known as the Tzetsou's alder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Aleuritia tzetsouensis is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
