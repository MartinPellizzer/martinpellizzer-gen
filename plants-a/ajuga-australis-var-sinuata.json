    "intro": "Ajuga australis var. sinuata, commonly known as the smoothleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern China. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often reaching heights of up to 15 centimeters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth, sinuate margin that gives the plant its variety name. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and modest floral display."
