    "intro": "Alpagrostis alpina, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil nutrients. Alpagrostis alpina typically forms dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine vegetation and a subject of study in plant ecology."
