    "intro": "Apteropteris applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, leathery fronds that are typically flat and linear. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The flat, broad shape of its leaves distinguishes it from other feather ferns and contributes to its unique appearance."
