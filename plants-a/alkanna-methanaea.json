    "intro": "Alkanna methanaea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, woody roots that are highly valued for their medicinal and dye properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alkanna methanaea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
