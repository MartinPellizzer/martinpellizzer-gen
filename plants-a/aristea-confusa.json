    "intro": "Aristea confusa, commonly known as the woolly aristea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
