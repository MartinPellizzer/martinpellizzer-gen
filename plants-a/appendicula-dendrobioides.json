    "intro": "Appendicula dendrobioides, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
