    "intro": "Acacia ridleyana, commonly known as the ridge acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. Acacia ridleyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ridleyana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the coastal regions and nearby inland areas of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of the region. Acacia ridleyana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ridleyana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since been found growing in the wild, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas, where it can spread aggressively. The plant is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems. Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption."
