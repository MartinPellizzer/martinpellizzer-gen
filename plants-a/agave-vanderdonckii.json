    "intro": "Agave vanderdonckii, commonly known as the Vanderdonck's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Agave vanderdonckii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
