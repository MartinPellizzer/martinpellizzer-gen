    "intro": "Abronia umbellata subsp. acutalata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery or grayish underside that helps reflect sunlight. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry, open habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.",

This subspecies is found in coastal regions along the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant is adapted to the mild, wet climate of these areas. It is commonly seen in dunes and other coastal habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata subsp. acutalata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. This subspecies is commonly found in regions such as southern California, Baja California, and parts of Oregon. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
