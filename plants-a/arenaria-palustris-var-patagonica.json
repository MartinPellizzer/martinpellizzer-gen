    "intro": "Arenaria palustris var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Patagonia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
