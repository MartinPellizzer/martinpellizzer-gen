It features a distinctive, delicate frond structure with long, slender pinnae that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its elegant foliage. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
