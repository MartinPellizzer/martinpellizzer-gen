    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. rubrocarpum, commonly known as the red-leaf sugar maple, is a rare variant of the sugar maple characterized by its striking red foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The leaves of this form turn a vibrant red in the fall, making it a visually distinctive species. It shares the same basic structure as the common sugar maple but exhibits unique coloration due to genetic variation. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks.",
