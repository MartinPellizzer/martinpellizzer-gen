    "intro": "Archboldiodendron calosericeum subsp. calosericeum, commonly known as the St. Lucia mahogany, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of St. Lucia in the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The flowers are small, clustered, and typically pink or white, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
