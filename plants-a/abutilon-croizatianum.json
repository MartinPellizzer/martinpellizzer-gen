This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon croizatianum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and soft, fuzzy foliage. It is commonly cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant for gardens and public spaces. The species has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the Mediterranean, southern Europe, and the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions have contributed to its widespread use in horticultural practices. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
