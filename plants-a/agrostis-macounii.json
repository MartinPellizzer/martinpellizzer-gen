    "intro": "Agrostis macounii, commonly known as Macoun's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Agrostis macounii is a low-growing plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
