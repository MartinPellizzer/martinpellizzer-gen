    "intro": "Asarum canadense var. pumilum, commonly known as Canadian wild ginger, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous structure, which is typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The rhizomatous root system of this plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
