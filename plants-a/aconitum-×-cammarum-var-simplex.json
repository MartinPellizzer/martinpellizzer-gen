    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
