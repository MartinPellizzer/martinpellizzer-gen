    "intro": "Agave wightii, commonly known as the Wight's agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave wightii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
