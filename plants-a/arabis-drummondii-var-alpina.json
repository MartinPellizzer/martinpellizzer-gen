It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats."
