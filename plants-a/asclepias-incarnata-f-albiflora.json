It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
