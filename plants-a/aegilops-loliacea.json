    "intro": "Aegilops loliacea, commonly known as goatgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops loliacea is sometimes considered a weed in crops but has also been studied for its potential in breeding programs for wheat improvement."
