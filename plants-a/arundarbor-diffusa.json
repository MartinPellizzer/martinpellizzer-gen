    "intro": "Arundarbor diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Arundarbor diffusa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
