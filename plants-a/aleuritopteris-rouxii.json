    "intro": "Aleuritopteris rouxii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Aleuritopteris rouxii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
