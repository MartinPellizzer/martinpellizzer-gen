    "intro": "Asplenium symmetricum, commonly known as the symmetrical spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in clusters called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium symmetricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens."
