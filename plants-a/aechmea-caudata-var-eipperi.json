    "intro": "Aechmea caudata var. eipperi, commonly known as the Eipper's spine orchid, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pinecone, often with vibrant red or orange bracts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
