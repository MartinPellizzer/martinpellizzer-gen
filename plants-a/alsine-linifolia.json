    "intro": "Alsine linifolia, commonly known as slender sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has small, oblong leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine linifolia is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
