    "intro": "Astragalus aquilonius, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus aquilonius is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
