It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",
