    "intro": "Adina multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved adina, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent. Its small, white to pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Adina multifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.",
