    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are upright and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
