It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agropyron subsecundum var. andinum plays a role in stabilizing soils in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
