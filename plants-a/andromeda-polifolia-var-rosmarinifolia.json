    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as sweet wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a fragrant, mint-like scent, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments."
