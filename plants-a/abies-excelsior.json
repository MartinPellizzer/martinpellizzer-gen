    "intro": "Abies excelsior, commonly known as the noble fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are coated with a waxy layer. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Abies excelsior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsior is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps, Carpathians, and Balkans. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. Its distribution includes parts of southern Germany, Austria, Italy, and northern Spain. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsior was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable climatic conditions, such as high-altitude areas and cool temperate forests. It is typically found in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate humidity. The distribution of Abies excelsior is often associated with areas that have a continental climate with cold winters and cool summers. Its introduction to new areas is usually intentional for reforestation or ornamental purposes. However, it may pose ecological risks if it outcompetes native species in non-native habitats."
