    "intro": "Alchornea glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf or glandular alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
