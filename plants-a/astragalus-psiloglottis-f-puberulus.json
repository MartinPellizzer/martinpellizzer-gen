    "intro": "Astragalus psiloglottis f. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus psiloglottis f. puberulus is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
