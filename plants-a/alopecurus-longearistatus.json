    "intro": "Alopecurus longearistatus, commonly known as the tall false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. The seeds are enclosed in small, three-angled capsules, which aid in its dispersal by wind."
