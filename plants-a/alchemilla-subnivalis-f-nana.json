    "intro": "Alchemilla subnivalis f. nana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. This form is notable for its compact size, making it well-suited to rocky and high-altitude environments."
