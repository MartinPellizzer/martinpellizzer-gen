    "intro": "Alchemilla mollis f. aprica, commonly known as the spring lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and early blooming habit."
