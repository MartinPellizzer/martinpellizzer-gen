    "intro": "Abies balsamea subsp. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and slightly twisted. The cones of this species are typically reddish-brown and hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing at high elevations. The Fraser fir is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in the Christmas tree industry.",

It is found in regions such as New England, New York, and parts of southern Ontario. This subspecies typically grows in cool, moist, and well-drained habitats, including forested areas and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with boreal and mixed forests, thriving in temperate climates. Its native range extends from the Appalachian Mountains to the northwestern regions of the United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies balsamea subsp. fraseri was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in higher elevations or northern regions. It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in boreal and subalpine forests. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It has been introduced to parts of North America, including the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Its distribution is largely influenced by its preference for cooler temperatures and adequate moisture."
