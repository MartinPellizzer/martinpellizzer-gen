    "intro": "Alisma geyeri var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces capsule fruits that disperse its seeds. This variety is characterized by its slender leaves and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies."
