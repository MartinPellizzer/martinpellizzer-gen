    "intro": "Ampelopsis mollifolia, commonly known as the soft-leaved bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its vines can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
