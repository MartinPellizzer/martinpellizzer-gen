    "intro": "Antiaris challa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a striking evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing a toxic, milky sap. Its unique appearance and toxic properties make it a notable species in botanical studies. Antiaris challa is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its potential hazards."
