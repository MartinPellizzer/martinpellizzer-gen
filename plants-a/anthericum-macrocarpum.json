    "intro": "Anthericum macrocarpum, commonly known as the broadleaf lily or broad-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces a showy, spadix surrounded by a spatulate leaf-like structure called a spathe, which is usually green with a deep red or purple band. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
