    "intro": "Antirrhinum micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and yellow. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two lips that resemble a dragon's mouth, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
