    "intro": "Asparagus dauricus var. elongatus, commonly known as the Daurian asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish-white flowers in panicle-like clusters, which are followed by feather-like, spiky berries. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
