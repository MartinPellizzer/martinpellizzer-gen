    "intro": "Asplenium trilobum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium trilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
