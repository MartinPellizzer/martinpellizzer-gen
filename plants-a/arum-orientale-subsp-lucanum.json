    "intro": "Arum orientale subsp. lucanum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive arrowhead shape at the base. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its size and dramatic appearance, it is a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes."
