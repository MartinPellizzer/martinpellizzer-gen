    "intro": "Asparagopsis rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often reddish stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Asparagopsis rubricaulis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clumps."
