    "intro": "Audouinia laevis, commonly known as the smooth Audouin's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Audouinia laevis is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in coastal and inland areas of the Canary Islands."
