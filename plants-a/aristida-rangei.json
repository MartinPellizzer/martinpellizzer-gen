    "intro": "Aristida rangei, commonly known as the Range's three-awn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, awned spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, producing delicate, greenish-white inflorescences. Aristida rangei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
