    "intro": "Achyrophorus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine achyrophorus, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and finely divided leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine regions where it adapts to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing fragile mountain ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
