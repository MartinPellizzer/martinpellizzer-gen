It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in coastal areas. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
