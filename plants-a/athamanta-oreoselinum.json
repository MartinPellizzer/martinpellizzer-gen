    "intro": "Athamanta oreoselinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
