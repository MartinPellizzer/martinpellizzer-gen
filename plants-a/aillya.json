    "intro": "Aillya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. Aillya thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
