    "intro": "Arum amphibium, commonly known as the water arum, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features a thick, swollen underground stem called a tuber, which stores nutrients and helps it survive in waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often floating on the water's surface, while its flowers are unique, with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist environments."
