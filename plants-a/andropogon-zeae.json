    "intro": "Andropogon zeae, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. This plant is also valued for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
