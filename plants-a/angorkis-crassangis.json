    "intro": "Angorkis crassangis, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal structure. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
