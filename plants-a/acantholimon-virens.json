    "intro": "Acantholimon virens, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Acantholimon virens is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. The species is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. Its distribution is largely confined to the Central Asian region, where it thrives in specific ecological niches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon virens was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is typically introduced as a ornamental or for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
