    "intro": "Ardisia dryeri, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are a key feature, attracting birds and adding ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
