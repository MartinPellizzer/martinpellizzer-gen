    "intro": "Astrophytum aureum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahua Desert in Mexico. It is a low-growing, globular plant with a smooth, ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically arranged in a star-like pattern. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental species."
