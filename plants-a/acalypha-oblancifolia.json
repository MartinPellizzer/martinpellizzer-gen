    "intro": "Acalypha oblancifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, spiky seed capsules. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha oblancifolia is primarily native to Guatemala and the southeastern regions of Mexico. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas within these regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range is limited to specific ecological zones in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha oblancifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shapes. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and landscapes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often used as a ground cover or in containers due to its compact growth habit. However, it has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
