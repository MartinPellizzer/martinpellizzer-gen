    "intro": "Artemisia lagopus subsp. lagopus, commonly known as the purple tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage with dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact, spherical clusters called capitula. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is also a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
