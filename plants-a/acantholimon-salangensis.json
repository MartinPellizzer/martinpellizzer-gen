    "intro": "Acantholimon salangensis, commonly known as the Salang mountain thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found at high altitudes. Acantholimon salangensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions.",

It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This plant is native to Central Asia, particularly the Himalayas and surrounding regions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes or ecological restoration. However, its distribution remains limited due to specific environmental requirements."
