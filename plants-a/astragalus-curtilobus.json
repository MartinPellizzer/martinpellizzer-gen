    "intro": "Astragalus curtilobus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Astragalus curtilobus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
