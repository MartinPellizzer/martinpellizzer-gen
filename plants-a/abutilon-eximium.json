    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon eximium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its native range extends into some parts of the Caribbean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon eximium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It has been found growing in moist, disturbed areas such as along roadsides and in forest edges. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in temperate climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
