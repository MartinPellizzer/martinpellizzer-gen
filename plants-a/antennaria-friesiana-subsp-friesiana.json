    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana subsp. friesiana, commonly known as the Friesian bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy stems and clustered, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant's leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
