    "intro": "Astelma retartum, commonly known as the false arum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with dark green, arrow-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a strong scent to attract pollinators. Astelma retartum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and dramatic, exotic appearance."
