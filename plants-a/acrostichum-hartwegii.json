    "intro": "Acrostichum hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.",
