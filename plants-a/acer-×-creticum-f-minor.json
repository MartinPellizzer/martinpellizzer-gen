It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tint in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting. Its ornamental value lies in its compact size and seasonal color changes.",
