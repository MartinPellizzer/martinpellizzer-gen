    "intro": "Aloe sulcata, commonly known as the Zebra Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ridged, and segmented leaves that give it a zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically gray-green with white or pale blue markings, and they are covered in a layer of wax to reduce water loss. Aloe sulcata produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
