    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. umbrosum, commonly known as the sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its subtle, sweet scent, which is more pronounced in certain varieties of the species."
