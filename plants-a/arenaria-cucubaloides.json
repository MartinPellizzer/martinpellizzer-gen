It typically forms dense mats of foliage and produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
