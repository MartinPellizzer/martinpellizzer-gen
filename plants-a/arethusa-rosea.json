    "intro": "Arethusa rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a distinctive central spur. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and oval, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Arethusa rosea is considered endangered due to habitat loss and is protected in many states."
