    "intro": "Adansonia alba, commonly known as the white baobab, is a striking tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, rounded trunk and thick, flaky bark that can reach several meters in thickness. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it has a unique ability to store water in its trunk, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
