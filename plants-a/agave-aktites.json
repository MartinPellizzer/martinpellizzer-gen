    "intro": "Agave aktites, commonly known as the Mexican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces a tall flower stalk bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color with white to pale green markings. Agave aktites is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
