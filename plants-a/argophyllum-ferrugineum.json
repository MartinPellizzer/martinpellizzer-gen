It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Argophyllum ferrugineum is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
