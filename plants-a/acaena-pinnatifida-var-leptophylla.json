    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. leptophylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the region of Otago. This variety grows in rocky and gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine areas. It is commonly associated with dry, open environments such as hillsides and scree slopes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. leptophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the botanical collections. The plant is now considered an invasive species in some regions of New Zealand due to its rapid spread. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it outcompetes native vegetation."
