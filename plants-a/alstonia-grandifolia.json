    "intro": "Alstonia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant's tears or the tree of life, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls at the ends of its branches. The plant produces showy, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Alstonia grandifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
