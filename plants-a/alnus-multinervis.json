    "intro": "Alnus multinervis, commonly known as the broad-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. Alnus multinervis has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
