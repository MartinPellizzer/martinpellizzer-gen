    "intro": "Acacia trinalis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia trinalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought. Acacia trinalis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trinalis was mainly introduced to the south-western regions of Australia. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It has been introduced to various parts of the country for its ecological benefits. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness."
