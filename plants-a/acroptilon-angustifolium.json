    "intro": "Acroptilon angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.",
