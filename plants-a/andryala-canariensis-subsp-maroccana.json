    "intro": "Andryala canariensis subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and its roots are extensive, helping it survive in poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
