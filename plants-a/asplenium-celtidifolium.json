    "intro": "Asplenium celtidifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically found in the lower part of the plant. Asplenium celtidifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
