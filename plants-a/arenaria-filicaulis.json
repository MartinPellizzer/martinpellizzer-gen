It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. Arenaria filicaulis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
