    "intro": "Actinocyclus secundus var. elatior, commonly known as the greater diatom, is a species of unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae. It is characterized by its intricate siliceous cell walls, or frustules, which are composed of two overlapping valves. The frustule of this species is typically elongated and has a distinct central area with radiating processes. It is commonly found in freshwater environments, including lakes and ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology, it is often used in paleolimnological studies to infer past environmental conditions.",
