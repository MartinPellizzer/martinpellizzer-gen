    "intro": "Alisma parnassifolium, commonly known as the Parnassian water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late summer. Alisma parnassifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
