    "intro": "Andropogon hamiltonii, commonly known as Hamilton's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hamilton's switchgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a bioenergy crop."
