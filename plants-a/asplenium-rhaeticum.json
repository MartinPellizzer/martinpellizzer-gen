    "intro": "Asplenium rhaeticum, commonly known as the Rhaetic spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium rhaeticum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
