    "intro": "Altamiranoa necaxana, commonly known as the Mexican rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soil and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
