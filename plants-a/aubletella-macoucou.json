    "intro": "Aubletella macoucou, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive color pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on the forest floor. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
