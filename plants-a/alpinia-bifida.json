    "intro": "Alpinia bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf ginger, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often split leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. Alpinia bifida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
