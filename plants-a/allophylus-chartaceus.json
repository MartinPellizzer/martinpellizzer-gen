    "intro": "Allophylus chartaceus, commonly known as the paperleaf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Allophylus chartaceus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique leaf texture and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
