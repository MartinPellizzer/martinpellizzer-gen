    "intro": "Ajuga laxa, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ajuga laxa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening."
