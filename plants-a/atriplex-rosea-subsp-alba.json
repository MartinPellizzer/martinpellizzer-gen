    "intro": "Atriplex rosea subsp. alba, commonly known as white saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to saline and poor soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate drought conditions."
