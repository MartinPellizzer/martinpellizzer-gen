    "intro": "Aconitum toxicum subsp. crispulum, commonly known as the curly-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately compound leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its highly toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
