    "intro": "Astragalus erubescens, commonly known as the pink milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus erubescens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
