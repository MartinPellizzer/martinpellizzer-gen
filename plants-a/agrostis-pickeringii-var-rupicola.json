    "intro": "Agrostis pickeringii var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
