    "intro": "Agave scaberrima, commonly known as the rough agave, is a perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that form a rosette shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. Agave scaberrima is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
