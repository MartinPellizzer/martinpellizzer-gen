    "intro": "Andropogon textilis, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is also valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and wildlife habitat. It is a key species in the development of bioenergy crops due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
