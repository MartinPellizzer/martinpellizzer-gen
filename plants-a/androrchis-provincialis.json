    "intro": "Androrchis provincialis, commonly known as the provincial orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, small, and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a short flowering period, usually in spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
