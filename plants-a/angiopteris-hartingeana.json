    "intro": "Angiopteris hartingeana, commonly known as the Harting's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, deeply divided leaf structure with a pale green color and a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators."
