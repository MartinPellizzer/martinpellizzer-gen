    "intro": "Afrocayratia ibuensis, commonly known as the Ibuensis Cayratia, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, often containing one or two seeds. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
