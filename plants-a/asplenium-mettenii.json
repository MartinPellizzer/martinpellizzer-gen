    "intro": "Asplenium mettenii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium mettenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
