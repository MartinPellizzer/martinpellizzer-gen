It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage plant in regions with limited water resources. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia enhances soil fertility."
