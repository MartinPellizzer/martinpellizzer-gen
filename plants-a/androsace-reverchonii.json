    "intro": "Androsace reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's Androsace, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
