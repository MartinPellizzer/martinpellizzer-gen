    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia dielsii is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within temperate forests. It is commonly found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its natural habitat is characterized by high biodiversity and distinct seasonal climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia dielsii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive clusters of white to pink flowers. It has been reported to naturalize in some areas, potentially becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among gardeners but requires careful management to prevent spread."
