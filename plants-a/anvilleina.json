    "intro": "Anvilleina, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often colorful flowers that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Anvilleina species typically grow in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
