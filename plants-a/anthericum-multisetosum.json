    "intro": "Anthericum multisetosum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds that are densely covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
