    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa subsp. typica, commonly known as the rough hulled wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive rough, bristly lemma and palea, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
