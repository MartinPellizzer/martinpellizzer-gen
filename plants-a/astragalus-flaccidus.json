    "intro": "Astragalus flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus flaccidus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
