    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteila nivicola var. nivicola, commonly known as the snow astelia, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features dense, rosette-like clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
