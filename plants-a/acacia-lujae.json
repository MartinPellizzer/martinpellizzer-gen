    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lujae is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western Australia. It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Goldfields regions, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry climates. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is often found in open woodlands and shrublands, growing as a small to medium-sized shrub. Due to its limited distribution, Acacia lujae is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lujae was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in native forests and along riverbanks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments have led to its classification as a potential invasive species. Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic value. Continued monitoring is necessary to assess its long-term effects on local ecosystems."
