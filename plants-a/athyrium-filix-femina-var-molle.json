    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. molle, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to eastern Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through underground stems. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a soft, feathery texture that distinguishes it from other fern varieties. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
