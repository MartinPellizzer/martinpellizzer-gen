    "intro": "Astragalus deserticola, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. Astragalus deserticola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in desert plains."
