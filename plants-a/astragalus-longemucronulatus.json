    "intro": "Astragalus longemucronulatus, commonly known as the long-pointed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus longemucronulatus is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
