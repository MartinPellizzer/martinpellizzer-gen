    "intro": "Alchemilla glacialis f. intermedia, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of silver-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
