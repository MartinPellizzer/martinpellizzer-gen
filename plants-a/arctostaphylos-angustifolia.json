    "intro": "Arctostaphylos angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves that are typically less than an inch wide. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Arctostaphylos angustifolia is well adapted to rocky soils and dry climates, making it a resilient species in arid environments."
