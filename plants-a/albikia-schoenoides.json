    "intro": "Albikia schoenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, often resembling a spike. Its stems are erect and can branch out, forming a low-growing shrub-like structure. Albikia schoenoides is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in coastal and sandy environments."
