    "intro": "Anthriscus nemorosa var. glabriuscula, commonly known as hedge garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, umbel-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens. The variety glabriuscula is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of Anthriscus nemorosa."
