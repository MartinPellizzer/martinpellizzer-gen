    "intro": "Acacia paraneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. Acacia paraneura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia paraneura belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants that include ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes and have a unique type of fruit called a legume. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorned appearance and the production of legume-like pods. Its species is Acacia paraneura, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions of Australia, known for its ecological and potential medicinal significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia paraneura is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia paraneura was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions such as southern Australia. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and ecological purposes. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
