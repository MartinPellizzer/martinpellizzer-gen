    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. catachnoa, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
