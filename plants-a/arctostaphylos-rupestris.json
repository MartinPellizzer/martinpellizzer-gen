    "intro": "Arctostaphylos rupestris, commonly known as the Sierra manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to drought and fire-prone environments."
