    "intro": "Aster glutinosus, commonly known as sticky aster, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 feet. Its sticky leaves help deter herbivores, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus Aster belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is known for its composite flower heads."
