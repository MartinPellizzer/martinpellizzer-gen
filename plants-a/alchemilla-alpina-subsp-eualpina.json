    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina subsp. eualpina, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy, and sometimes lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate cold and dry conditions."
