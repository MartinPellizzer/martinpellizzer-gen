    "intro": "Astragalus tinctus, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Astragalus tinctus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
