    "intro": "Alyssum mildeanum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum mildeanum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
