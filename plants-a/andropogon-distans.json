It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green blades that turn golden in the fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Andropogon distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
