    "intro": "Arachnorchis corynephora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or in shaded, humid environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
