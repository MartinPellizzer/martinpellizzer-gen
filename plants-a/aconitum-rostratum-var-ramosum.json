    "intro": "Aconitum rostratum var. ramosum, commonly known as the ramose aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
