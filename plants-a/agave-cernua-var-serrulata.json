    "intro": "Agave cernua var. serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and architectural form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
