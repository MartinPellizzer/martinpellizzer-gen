    "intro": "Andropogon hypogynus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Andropogon hypogynus is an important component of wetland habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
