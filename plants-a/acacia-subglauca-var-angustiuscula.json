    "intro": "Acacia subglauca var. angustiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features slender, angular stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically a dull green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in spikes and bloom during the autumn season. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subglauca var. angustiuscula is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and southwestern Angola. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sand dunes, and dry shrublands where it thrives in low rainfall conditions. This variety is adapted to harsh environments and is often seen growing in association with other drought-tolerant flora. Its distribution is closely linked to specific soil types and microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its survival. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subglauca var. angustiuscula was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been established in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and sandy soils. It has been reported in conservation areas and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions. Its introduction may have ecological implications due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
