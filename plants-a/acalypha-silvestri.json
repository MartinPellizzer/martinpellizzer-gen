    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha silvestri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these areas, where it grows as an understorey species. It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of these tropical habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha silvestri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by human activity, such as through horticultural trade or intentional planting. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond cultivated gardens. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
