    "intro": "Achyronia pinea, commonly known as the dwarf pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. The dwarf pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal environments.",
