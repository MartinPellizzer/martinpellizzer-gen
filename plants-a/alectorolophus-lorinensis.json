    "intro": "Alectorolophus lorinensis, commonly known as the Lorin's lophopetalum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and often white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alectorolophus lorinensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
