    "intro": "Alyssum dicranoides, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alyssum dicranoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
