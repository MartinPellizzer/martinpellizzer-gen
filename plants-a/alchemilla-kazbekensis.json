    "intro": "Alchemilla kazbekensis, commonly known as the Kazbek alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the plant is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Alchemilla kazbekensis is an example of a plant that has evolved to survive in harsh, alpine environments."
