    "intro": "Aniseia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower anise plant, is a herbaceous species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in the summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a strong anise-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Aniseia uniflora is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
