    "intro": "Anthyllis vulgaris, commonly known as the common anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often forming dense clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Anthyllis vulgaris is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
