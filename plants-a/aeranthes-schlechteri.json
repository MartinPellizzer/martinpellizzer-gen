    "intro": "Aeranthes schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy, spider-like flower that is often pale green or yellowish in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
