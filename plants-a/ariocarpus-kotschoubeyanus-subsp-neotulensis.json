    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. neotulensis, commonly known as the \"Mexican windowleaf,\" is a succulent cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in horticulture."
