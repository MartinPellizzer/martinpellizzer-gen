    "intro": "Asplenium lofouense, commonly known as the Lofouense spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Asplenium lofouense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
