    "intro": "Asplenium caudatum, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, creeping rhizomes that produce small, clustered fronds. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive tail-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Asplenium caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
