    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima var. sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese tree of heaven, is a variant of the tree of heaven native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its compound leaves with 12 to 30 pairs of leaflets, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by bright orange to red seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates, making it a hardy and fast-growing species. Botanically, it is notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to colonize disturbed areas, which has led to its classification as an invasive species in many regions."
