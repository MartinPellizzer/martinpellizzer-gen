    "intro": "Anisophyllum humifusum, commonly known as the low saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Anisophyllum humifusum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine and arctic wildlife."
