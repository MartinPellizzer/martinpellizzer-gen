    "intro": "Armeria montana, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of linear, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white powder. Armeria montana is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
