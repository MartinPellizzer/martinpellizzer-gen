    "intro": "Anemia dardanoi, commonly known as the Dardanian anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, petal-like sepals that resemble true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Anemia dardanoi blooms in spring, producing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
