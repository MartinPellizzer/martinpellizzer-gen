    "intro": "Arctium hololeucum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
