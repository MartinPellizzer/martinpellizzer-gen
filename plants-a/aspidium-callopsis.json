    "intro": "Aspidium callopsis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces spores in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium callopsis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
