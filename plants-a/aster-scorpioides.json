It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like structures called cypselae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open plains and disturbed soils. Aster scorpioides is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in its native range."
