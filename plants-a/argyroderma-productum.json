It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Argyroderma productum is often found in dry, arid environments and is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
