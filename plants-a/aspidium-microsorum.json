    "intro": "Aspidium microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aspidium microsorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
