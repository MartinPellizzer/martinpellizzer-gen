    "intro": "Ascium goyasense, commonly known as the Goyasense cup fungus, is a unique species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped fruiting body. It typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The fungus produces ascospores within the ascus, which are released to propagate the species. Its morphology includes a smooth or hairy surface, depending on the specific habitat. Ascium goyasense is of interest to mycologists due to its ecological role in decomposing organic matter."
