    "intro": "Allium parvum var. brucae, commonly known as the Bruca garlic, is a botanical variant of the common garlic species. It is characterized by its small, bulbous structure composed of tightly clustered cloves. The plant produces a strong, pungent aroma due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, typical of many Allium species. This variety is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal properties."
