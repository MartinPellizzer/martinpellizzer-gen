    "intro": "Alpinia nobilis, commonly known as the fragrant ginger or wild ginger, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their pungent aroma. Alpinia nobilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories."
