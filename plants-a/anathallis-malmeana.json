    "intro": "Anathallis malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's spider orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like inflorescence and pale greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, elongated petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
