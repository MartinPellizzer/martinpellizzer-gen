    "intro": "Anagallis alternifolia var. repens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
