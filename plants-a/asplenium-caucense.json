    "intro": "Asplenium caucense, commonly known as the Caucasian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium caucense is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
