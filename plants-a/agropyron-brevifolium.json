    "intro": "Agropyron brevifolium, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Agropyron brevifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
