    "intro": "Alnus incana f. oxyloba, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found near water bodies. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve soil quality through nitrogen fixation."
