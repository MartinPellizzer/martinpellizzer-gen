    "intro": "Adiantum grandifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum grandifolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
