It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy species often found in harsh, exposed environments."
