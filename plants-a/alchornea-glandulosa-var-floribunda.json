It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that dehisce to release tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
