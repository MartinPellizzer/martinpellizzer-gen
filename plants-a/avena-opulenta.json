    "intro": "Avena opulenta, commonly known as the giant oat, is a tall, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale blue flowers, which are arranged in a loose, branching pattern. Avena opulenta is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural collections."
