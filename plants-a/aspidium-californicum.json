    "intro": "Aspidium californicum, commonly known as the California water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium californicum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
