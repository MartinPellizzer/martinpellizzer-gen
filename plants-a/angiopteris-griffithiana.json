    "intro": "Angiopteris griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Angiopteris griffithiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
