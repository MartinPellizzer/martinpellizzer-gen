    "intro": "Astragalus pavlovianus, commonly known as the Pavlov's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Astragalus pavlovianus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
