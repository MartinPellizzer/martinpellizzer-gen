    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris var. protrusum, commonly known as the \"Veil Tarn\" or \"Maiden's Hair Fern,\" is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.",
