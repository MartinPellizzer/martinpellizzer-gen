    "intro": "Aira incompleta, commonly known as the incomplete air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit. Aira incompleta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
