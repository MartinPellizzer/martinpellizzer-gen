    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia var. crateriana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and along the Gulf Coast. It is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. The plant is often part of the understory vegetation in these wetland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia var. crateriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify the local plant palette. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the warm, humid conditions of these regions. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has led to discussions about ecological management and control."
