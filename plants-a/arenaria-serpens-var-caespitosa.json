    "intro": "Arenaria serpens var. caespitosa, commonly known as silver carpet grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of tiny, silver-gray leaves that lie close to the ground, giving it a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
