    "intro": "Anemia hatschbachii, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with sufficient sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
