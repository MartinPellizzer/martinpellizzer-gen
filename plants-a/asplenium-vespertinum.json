    "intro": "Asplenium vespertinum, commonly known as the nightshade spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often clustered together. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and leaf surfaces. It is typically found growing on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate regions. Asplenium vespertinum plays a minor role in ecological systems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
