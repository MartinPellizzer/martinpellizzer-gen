    "intro": "Asplenium pseudowrightii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium pseudowrightii is an evergreen fern that contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
