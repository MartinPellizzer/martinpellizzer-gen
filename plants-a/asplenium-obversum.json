    "intro": "Asplenium obversum, commonly known as the upturned spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that curve upward, giving it its common name. The plant has a simple, short rhizome and produces spore-bearing leaves that are typically smaller than the sterile ones. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium obversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
