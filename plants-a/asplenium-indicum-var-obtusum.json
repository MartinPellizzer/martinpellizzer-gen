    "intro": "Asplenium indicum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular ornamental plant. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
