    "intro": "Ardisia flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
