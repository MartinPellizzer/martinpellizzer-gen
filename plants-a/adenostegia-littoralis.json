    "intro": "Adenostegia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with high salt exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Adenostegia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.",
