    "intro": "Alairia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Alairia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
