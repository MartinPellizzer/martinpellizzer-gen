    "intro": "Araucaria columnaris f. luxurians, commonly known as the dense columnar Araucaria, is a variant of the silver fir that exhibits a more compact and bushy growth habit compared to the typical form. It features closely packed, cylindrical cones and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely arranged. The plant is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. This form is less common in the wild and is primarily grown as a horticultural specimen."
