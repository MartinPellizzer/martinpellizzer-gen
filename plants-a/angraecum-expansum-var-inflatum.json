    "intro": "Angraecum expansum var. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated angraecum, is a unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers with a prominent, inflated lip that resembles a bell or a balloon. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance, especially at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance."
