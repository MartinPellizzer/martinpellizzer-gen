    "intro": "Asplenium pavonicum, commonly known as the pavonie fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium pavonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
