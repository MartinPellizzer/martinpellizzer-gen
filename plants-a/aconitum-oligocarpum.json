    "intro": "Aconitum oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum oligocarpum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle or ingest.",
