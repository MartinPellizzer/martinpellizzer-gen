    "intro": "Abildgaardia compressa, commonly known as the compressed abildgaardia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia compressa is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of North and South Carolina. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune habitats and other maritime environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the southeastern coastal plains.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia compressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a persistent weed in forested regions. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
