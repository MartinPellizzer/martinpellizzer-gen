    "intro": "Apatostelis minimiflora, commonly known as the small-flower pterostigma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often overlooked due to their size. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
