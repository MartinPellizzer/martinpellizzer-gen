It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that form a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
