    "intro": "Aralia nobilis, commonly known as the noble aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aralia nobilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
