    "intro": "Azorella pallida, commonly known as the pale azorella, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Azorella pallida is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can endure harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
