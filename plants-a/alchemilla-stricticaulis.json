    "intro": "Alchemilla stricticaulis, commonly known as the upright lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the more commonly known spreading varieties of Alchemilla. The plant features basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Alchemilla stricticaulis is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
