    "intro": "Ancipitia caprina, commonly known as the goat's horn plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. Ancipitia caprina is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and resilience to drought conditions."
