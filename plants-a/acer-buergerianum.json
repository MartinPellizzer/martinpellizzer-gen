    "intro": "Acer buergerianum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, and Taiwan. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It is often associated with humid forests and is well adapted to the local environmental conditions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Its natural range reflects its preference for specific ecological niches across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum was mainly introduced to Italy, Korea, Tadzhikistan, and Uzbekistan. It has been established in these regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value. The introduction of this species has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. It is important to monitor its spread to prevent unintended ecological consequences. This plant's distribution highlights the role of human activity in the spread of non-native species."
