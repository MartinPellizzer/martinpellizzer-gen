    "intro": "Acrodiclidium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with dense, scale-like leaves that form a tight rosette. Acrodiclidium rigidum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and its role in understanding the evolution of early land plants.",
