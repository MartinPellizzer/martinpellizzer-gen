    "intro": "Alisma subalatum, commonly known as the alpine water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Asia. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in rocky soils and absorb nutrients from water. Alisma subalatum is adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of high-altitude wetlands."
