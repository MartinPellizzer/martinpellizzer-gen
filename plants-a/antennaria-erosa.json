    "intro": "Antennaria erosa, commonly known as the sticky willow or mouse-ear moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, hairy leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Antennaria erosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Its sticky, glandular hairs on the leaves help deter herbivores and retain moisture in its habitat."
