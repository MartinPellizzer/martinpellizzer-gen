    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing,\u4e1b\u751f structure and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or gravelly habitats. This hardy species is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
