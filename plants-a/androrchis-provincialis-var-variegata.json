    "intro": "Androrchis provincialis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated provincial orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in China. It is characterized by its strikingly patterned leaves, which display a mix of green and white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
