    "intro": "Alfaroa williamsii subsp. tapantiensis, commonly known as the Tapant\u00ed alfaroa, is a rare plant species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
