    "intro": "Aruncus sylvester var. tomentosus, commonly known as the fuzzy goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery plumes of white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found near streams or in thickets. Its unique foliage and showy inflorescence make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
