    "intro": "Aligera eichleriana, commonly known as the Eichler's aliger, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aligera eichleriana is considered a species of conservation concern."
