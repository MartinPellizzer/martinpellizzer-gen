    "intro": "Arachniodes rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rhombic-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate, web-like patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a fascinating subject for both scientific study and botanical gardens."
