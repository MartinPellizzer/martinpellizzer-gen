    "intro": "Androcalva melanopetala, commonly known as the black-petaled orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique dark purple to black petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
