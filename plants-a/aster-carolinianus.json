    "intro": "Aster carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces showy purple to pink flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
