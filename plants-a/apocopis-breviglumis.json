    "intro": "Apocopis breviglumis, commonly known as the short-winged grasshopper, is a species of leafhopper belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its small, slender body and distinctive wing patterns, which provide camouflage in its natural habitat. This plant-feeding insect is typically found in grassy areas and is often associated with flowering plants. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with the nymphs resembling the adults but lacking fully developed wings. Apocopis breviglumis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment, though it is not considered a significant agricultural pest."
