It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
