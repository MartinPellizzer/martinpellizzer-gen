    "intro": "Arachniodes sinorhomboidea, commonly known as the Chinese spider fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive shape that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
