    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid sandverbena, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features linear, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. The rigid sandverbena is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
