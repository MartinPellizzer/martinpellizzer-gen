It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits, which are often used as a source of grain. It is a hardy annual that thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas. Aira miliacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional agriculture."
