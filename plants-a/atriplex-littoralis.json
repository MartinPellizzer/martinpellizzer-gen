    "intro": "Atriplex littoralis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Atriplex littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
