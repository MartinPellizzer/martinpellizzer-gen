    "intro": "Askolame biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered beauty, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, bi-colored flowers that range from deep violet to pale lavender, often with intricate patterns. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect intense sunlight. Its blooming period occurs during the short, cool season in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Askolame biflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
