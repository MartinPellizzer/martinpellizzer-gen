    "intro": "Astiria, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astiria is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
