    "intro": "Adiantopsis timida, commonly known as the timid maidenhair fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Adiantopsis timida is considered a conservation concern.",
