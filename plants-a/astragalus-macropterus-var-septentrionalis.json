It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various wildlife species."
