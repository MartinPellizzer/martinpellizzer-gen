    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia blommaertii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in savanna woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy species in these environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife. Acacia blommaertii is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia blommaertii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, thriving in sandy and rocky soils. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance. However, it has raised concerns as a potential invasive species in some areas. Its distribution is primarily limited to coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate."
