    "intro": "Andropogon polyphyllus, commonly known as the purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy panicles that turn a striking purple color in the fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a blue-gray hue, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Andropogon polyphyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
