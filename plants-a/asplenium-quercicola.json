    "intro": "Asplenium quercicola, commonly known as the oak fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Asplenium quercicola is often found in association with oak trees, which is reflected in its common name."
