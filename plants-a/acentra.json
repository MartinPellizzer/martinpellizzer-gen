    "intro": "Acentra, commonly known as the \"dwarf African violet,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. Acentra species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. The flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from pink to purple, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
