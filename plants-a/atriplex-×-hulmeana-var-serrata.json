    "intro": "Atriplex \u00d7 hulmeana var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the genus Atriplex. It thrives in coastal and inland salt-affected soils, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration. Its variability in leaf shape and growth form contributes to its ecological flexibility and resilience."
