    "intro": "Aechmea armata, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a spadix of small white flowers surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. Its unique structure and ability to store water make it well adapted to its natural habitat."
