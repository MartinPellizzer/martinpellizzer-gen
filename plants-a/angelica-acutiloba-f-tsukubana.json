    "intro": "Angelica acutiloba f. tsukubana, commonly known as the Tsukubana angelica, is a rare and distinctive variant of the angelica plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional Japanese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
