    "intro": "Astragalus discessiflorus, commonly known as the split-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus discessiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations in its native range."
