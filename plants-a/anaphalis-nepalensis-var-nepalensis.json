    "intro": "Anaphalis nepalensis var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its foliage consists of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
