    "intro": "Acrostichum blanchetii, commonly known as the Blanquet's brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. The plant features a rosette of lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Acrostichum blanchetii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate environmental conditions.",
