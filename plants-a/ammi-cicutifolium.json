    "intro": "Ammi cicutifolium, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for edible plants like parsley or carrots. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its stems are hollow and have a distinctive, aromatic scent, though the plant is highly toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows."
