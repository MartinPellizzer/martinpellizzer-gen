    "intro": "Asplenium hians var. pallescens, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery or pale green hue. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
