    "intro": "Affonsea pteropoda, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The flowers, which appear in clusters, are often pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
