    "intro": "Argyreia dokmaihom, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy environments and has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Andean medicine."
