    "intro": "Antennaria rosea, commonly known as the rose pink pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry, succulent stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat. Antennaria rosea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun."
