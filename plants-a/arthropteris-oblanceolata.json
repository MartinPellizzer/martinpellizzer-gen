    "intro": "Arthropteris oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
