    "intro": "Arenaria pumicola, commonly known as the pumice sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water. Arenaria pumicola is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
