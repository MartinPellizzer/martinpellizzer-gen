    "intro": "Anthericum flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping lily or flexuous lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Anthericum flexuosum is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
