    "intro": "Aspidistra lobata, commonly known as the broad-leaf aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy, and leathery leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aspidistra lobata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
