    "intro": "Allium carinatum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or wild leek, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium carinatum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
