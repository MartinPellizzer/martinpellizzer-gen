    "intro": "Andropogon macrolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Andropogon macrolepis is valued for its ecological benefits and is often used in restoration projects."
