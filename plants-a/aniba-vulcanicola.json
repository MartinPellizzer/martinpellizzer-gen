    "intro": "Aniba vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic ash tree, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
