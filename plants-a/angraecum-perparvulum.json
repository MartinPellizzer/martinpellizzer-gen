It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically clustered closely together, and it produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique, elongated, and often twisted sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
