    "intro": "Aconitum volubile var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue to purple flowers, which are typically borne on tall, branching stems. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a coarse texture and a hairy surface, giving it its \"pubescent\" designation. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
