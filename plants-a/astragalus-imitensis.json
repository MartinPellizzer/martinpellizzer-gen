    "intro": "Astragalus imitensis, commonly known as the mimic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to brown pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus imitensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
