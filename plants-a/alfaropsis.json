    "intro": "Alfaropsis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Alfaropsis produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for desert wildlife."
