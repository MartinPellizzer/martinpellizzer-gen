    "intro": "Arundo coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Arundo coleotricha is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
