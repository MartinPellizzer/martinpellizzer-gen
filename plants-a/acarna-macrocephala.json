    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarna macrocephala is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarna macrocephala was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. It was initially brought for ornamental purposes due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through water and wind have led to concerns about its ecological impact. Despite its beauty, efforts are being made to control its spread in affected regions."
