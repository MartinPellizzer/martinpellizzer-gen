    "intro": "Aulomyrcia sphaerocarpa var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variant is distinguished by its more tree-like growth habit compared to other varieties of Aulomyrcia."
