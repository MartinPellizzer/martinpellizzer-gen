    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 garhwalense nothosubsp. garhwalense, commonly known as the Garhwal spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
