    "intro": "Avena virescens, commonly known as green oat or slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Avena virescens is also valued as a forage crop for livestock due to its nutritional content."
