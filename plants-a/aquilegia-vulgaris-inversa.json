    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris inversa, commonly known as the reverse heartleaf columbine, is a rare variant of the common columbine. It is characterized by its distinctive upward-facing flowers, which contrast with the typical downward-facing blooms of the standard species. The plant features compound, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its unique floral orientation and ornamental foliage make it a prized specimen among horticultural enthusiasts."
