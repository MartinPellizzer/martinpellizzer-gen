    "intro": "Asplenium enatum var. dareoides, commonly known as the Bristly Water Fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed fronds that are often covered with small, bristly structures. This plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and robust, anchoring it in moist soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
