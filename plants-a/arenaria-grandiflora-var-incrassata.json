    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. incrassata, commonly known as the broad-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The varietal name 'incrassata' refers to its thickened, fleshy leaves, which help conserve moisture in arid environments."
