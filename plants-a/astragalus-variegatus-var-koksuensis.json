It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and compound leaves with a distinctive variegation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
