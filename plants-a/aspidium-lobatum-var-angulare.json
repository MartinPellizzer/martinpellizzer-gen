    "intro": "Aspidium lobatum var. angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually dark green and can be used in ornamental water gardens."
