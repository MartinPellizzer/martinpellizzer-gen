    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern regions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high humidity. Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar's diverse ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many of these regions. Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant ecological concern in several countries."
