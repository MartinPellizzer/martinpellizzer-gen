    "intro": "Agropyron confusum, commonly known as the confused wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron confusum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its seeds are sometimes used in agricultural or horticultural applications due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil."
