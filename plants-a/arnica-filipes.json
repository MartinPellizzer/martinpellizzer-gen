    "intro": "Arnica filipes, commonly known as the slender mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are composed of numerous tubular petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Arnica filipes is valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
