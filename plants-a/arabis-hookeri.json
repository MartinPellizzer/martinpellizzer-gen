    "intro": "Arabis hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
