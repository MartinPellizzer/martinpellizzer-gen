    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax wilsonii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, including provinces such as Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hubei. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. It is often associated with secondary forests and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax wilsonii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with temperate climates. It is commonly found in forested areas, often growing along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in certain parts of the country. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
