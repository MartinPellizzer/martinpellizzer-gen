    "intro": "Atriplex johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and desert landscapes. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species for stabilizing soil in harsh, arid conditions."
