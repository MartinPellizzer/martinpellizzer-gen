    "intro": "Alchemilla gracilipes, commonly known as slender alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-green hue due to dense pubescence. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Alchemilla gracilipes is adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
