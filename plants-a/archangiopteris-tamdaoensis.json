    "intro": "Archangiopteris tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tam Dao fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sporangium, which is clustered in specialized structures called sori. Native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
