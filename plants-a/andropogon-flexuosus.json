    "intro": "Andropogon flexuosus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types and climates. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. Switchgrass is a perennial plant that produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to disturbed sites and is often used in restoration ecology due to its hardiness and ecological benefits. Additionally, it is a valuable source of biomass for renewable energy and erosion control."
