    "intro": "Acroanthes, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plants typically grow in wet or marshy environments, making them common in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Acroanthes species are perennial herbs with alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Their flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance."
