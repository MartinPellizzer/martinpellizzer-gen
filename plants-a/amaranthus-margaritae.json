    "intro": "Amaranthus margaritae, commonly known as the pearl amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds, known as amaranth grains, are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and ceremonial purposes. Amaranthus margaritae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
