    "intro": "Alsophila kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its ability to form dense thickets. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
