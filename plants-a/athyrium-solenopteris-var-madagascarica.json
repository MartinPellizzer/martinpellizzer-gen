    "intro": "Athyrium solenopteris var. madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar sword fern, is a variant of the feather-leaf fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a striking silver or white margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of the fern family."
