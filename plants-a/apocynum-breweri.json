    "intro": "Apocynum breweri, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Apocynum breweri plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
