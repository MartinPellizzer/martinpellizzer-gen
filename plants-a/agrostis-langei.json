    "intro": "Agrostis langei, commonly known as Lange's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying native flora."
