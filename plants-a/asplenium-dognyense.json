    "intro": "Asplenium dognyense, commonly known as the Dogny's spleenwort, is a member of the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed fronds. It is a terrestrial or epiphytic fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tufts of leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Asplenium dognyense is noted for its delicate appearance and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
