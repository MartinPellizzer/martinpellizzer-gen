    "intro": "Acrostichum costatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum costatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
