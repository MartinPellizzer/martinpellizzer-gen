    "intro": "Ascogrammitis alan-smithii, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its small, spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
