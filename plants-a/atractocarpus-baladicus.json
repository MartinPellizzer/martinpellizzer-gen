    "intro": "Atractocarpus baladicus, commonly known as the Baladica mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, aromatic leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's heartwood is highly valued for its durability and rich, reddish-brown color. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
