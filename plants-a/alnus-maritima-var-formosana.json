    "intro": "Alnus maritima var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan alder, is a variant of the coastal alder native to Taiwan. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, clustered catkins in the spring, which are male and female, and it relies on wind pollination. This species is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
