It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Adiantum chilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.",
