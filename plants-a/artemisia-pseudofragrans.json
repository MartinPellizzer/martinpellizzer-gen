    "intro": "Artemisia pseudofragrans, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of compounds for pharmaceutical applications."
