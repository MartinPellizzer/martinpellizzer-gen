    "intro": "Alyssum filifolium, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
