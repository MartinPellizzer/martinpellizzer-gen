    "intro": "Anthurium scandens subsp. scandens, commonly known as the climbing anthurium, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or yellow hues. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other supports."
