    "intro": "Aleuritopteris speciosa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, bipinnate pattern."
