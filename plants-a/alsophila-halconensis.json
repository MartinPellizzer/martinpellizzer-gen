    "intro": "Alsophila halconensis, commonly known as the Halcon fern, is a species of tree fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a leathery texture, and they grow in a dense, upright arrangement. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
