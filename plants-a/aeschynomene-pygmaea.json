    "intro": "Aeschynomene pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf sicklepod, is a small annual herb native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aeschynomene pygmaea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
