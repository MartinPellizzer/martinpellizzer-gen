    "intro": "Amelanchier arborea subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a deep red or purple color in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
