    "intro": "Adiantum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to eastern North America. It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. Adiantum hirsutum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings or as a houseplant.",
