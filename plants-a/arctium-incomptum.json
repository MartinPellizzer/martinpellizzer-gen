    "intro": "Arctium incomptum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Arctium incomptum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
