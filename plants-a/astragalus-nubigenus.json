    "intro": "Astragalus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloudland milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Astragalus nubigenus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a subject of interest for botanical and ecological studies."
