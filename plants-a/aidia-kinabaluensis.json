    "intro": "Aidia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu aidia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and unique ecological niche, Aidia kinabaluensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
