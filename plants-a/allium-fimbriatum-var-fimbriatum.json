It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive fringed appearance. The plant is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bulbs that store nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
