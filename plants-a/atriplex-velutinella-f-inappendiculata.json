    "intro": "Atriplex velutinella f. inappendiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, saline conditions."
