This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mairei was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems."
