    "intro": "Alnus ovata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for wildlife."
