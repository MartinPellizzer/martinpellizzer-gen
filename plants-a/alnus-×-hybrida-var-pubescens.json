    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 hybrida var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces on its stems and leaves. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins as its primary reproductive structure, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It has a shallow root system that helps in soil stabilization, making it useful for erosion control. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in certain landscapes."
