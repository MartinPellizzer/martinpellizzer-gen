    "intro": "Andropogon anthesterioides, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
