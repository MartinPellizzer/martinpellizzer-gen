    "intro": "Androsace alchemilloides, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
