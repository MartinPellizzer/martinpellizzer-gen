    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum var. protobillotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The fronds are typically short and upright, often forming a dense, compact cluster. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Asplenium genus."
