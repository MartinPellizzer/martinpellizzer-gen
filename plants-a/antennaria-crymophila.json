    "intro": "Antennaria crymophila, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Antennaria crymophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
