    "intro": "Asplenium ceterach subsp. ceterach, commonly known as the rock fern or scaly shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
