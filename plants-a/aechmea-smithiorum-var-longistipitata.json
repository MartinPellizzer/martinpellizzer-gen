    "intro": "Aechmea smithiorum var. longistipitata, commonly known as the long-stemmed pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture and prominent midribs. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which can last for several months. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in the central rosette, adapting it to its natural habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
