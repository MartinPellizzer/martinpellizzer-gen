    "intro": "Anthurium spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking spathes, which are modified leaves that enclose the spadix, a fleshy, spiky structure containing the actual flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium spathulifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
