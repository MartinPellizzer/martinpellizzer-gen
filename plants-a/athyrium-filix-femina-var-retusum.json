    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. retusum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to East Asia. It is a fern characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The varietal name \"retusum\" refers to the rounded or blunt tips of its fronds, distinguishing it from other varieties."
