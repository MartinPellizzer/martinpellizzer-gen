    "intro": "Agropyron campestre, commonly known as the field grass or wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Agropyron campestre is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage production."
