It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive, narrow, linear shape. It produces spores in tiny, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This variety is closely related to other asplenium species and is often found in woodland habitats."
