    "intro": "Adenosacme coriacea, commonly known as the rough adenosacme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of South America. It features succulent, thickened leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stem is covered in a rough, waxy texture, which provides additional protection against desiccation. Adenosacme coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.",
