    "intro": "Agave ortgiesiana, commonly known as the Ortegiesia agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or pale margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
