    "intro": "Australopyrum retrofractum subsp. velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf australopyrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its basal rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
