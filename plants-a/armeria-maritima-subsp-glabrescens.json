    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as sea thrift, is a coastal plant native to the northern Atlantic coast of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of foliage and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shorelines. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing food for pollinators."
