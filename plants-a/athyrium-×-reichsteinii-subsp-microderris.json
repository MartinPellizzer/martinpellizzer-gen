    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 reichsteinii subsp. microderris, commonly known as the miniature shield fern, is a hybrid fern species characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with intricate, finely divided pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
