    "intro": "Acantholimon venustum, commonly known as the rare desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acantholimon venustum is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon venustum is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, and Turkey. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with mountainous or coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for specific ecological niches in the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon venustum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there as part of early botanical introductions during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats, though it is not considered invasive in most regions. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance and ecological niche."
