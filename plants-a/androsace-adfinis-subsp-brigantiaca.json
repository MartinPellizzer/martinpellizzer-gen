    "intro": "Androsace adfinis subsp. brigantiaca, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes."
