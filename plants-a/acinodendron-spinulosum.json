    "intro": "Acinodendron spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose acacia, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pairs of opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.",
