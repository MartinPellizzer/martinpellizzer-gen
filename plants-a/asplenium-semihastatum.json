    "intro": "Asplenium semihastatum, commonly known as the semi-hastate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium semihastatum is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
