It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple-tinted flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitat in native plant gardens."
