    "intro": "Aster alpigenus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
