It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance, and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks.",
