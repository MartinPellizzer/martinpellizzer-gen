    "intro": "Acetosella dichondrifolia, commonly known as the lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its stems are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Acetosella dichondrifolia is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
