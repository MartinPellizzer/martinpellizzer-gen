    "intro": "Asclepias velutina, commonly known as the velvet milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in supporting pollinator populations. Asclepias velutina is also a critical host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
