    "intro": "Astragalus exscapus subsp. pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubiflorous milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers clustered in dense, spiny pods. The subspecies is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) floral bracts, which give it its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments."
