    "intro": "Aleuritopteris aurea, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often curled and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aleuritopteris aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
