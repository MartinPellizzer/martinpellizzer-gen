    "intro": "Arctostaphylos zacaensis, commonly known as the Zaca manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
