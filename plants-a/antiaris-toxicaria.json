    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or the Natal palm, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. Its trunk is thick and segmented, often mistaken for a tree, but it is actually a type of cycad. Despite its ornamental value, all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it dangerous to handle or ingest."
