    "intro": "Asclepias pseudofimbriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and contains latex sap that is toxic to some animals. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
