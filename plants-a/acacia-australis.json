    "intro": "Acacia australis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia australis is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal regions and inland deserts. This species is commonly associated with sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia australis is also known for its hardy, thorny growth habit and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its resilience.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia australis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. This plant has been introduced to various regions in Australia, including New South Wales and South Australia. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective choice for windbreaks and habitat creation. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
