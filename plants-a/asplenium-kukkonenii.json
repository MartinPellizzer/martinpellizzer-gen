    "intro": "Asplenium kukkonenii, commonly known as the Kukkonen's shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
