    "intro": "Ammannia salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf ammannia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ammannia salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
