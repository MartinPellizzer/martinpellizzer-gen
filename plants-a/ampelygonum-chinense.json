    "intro": "Ampelygonum chinense, commonly known as Chinese climbing fern, is a perennial vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
