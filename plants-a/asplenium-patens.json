    "intro": "Asplenium patens, commonly known as the spreading spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests, rock crevices, and on tree trunks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium patens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to different growing conditions."
