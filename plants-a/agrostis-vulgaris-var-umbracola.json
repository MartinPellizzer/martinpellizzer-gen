    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. umbracola, commonly known as the shadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that often appear in shaded or partially shaded environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
