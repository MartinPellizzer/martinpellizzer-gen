    "intro": "Agropyron attenuatum var. ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
