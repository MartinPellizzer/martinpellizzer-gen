It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its short, stout trunk and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for thatching, while the fruit is sometimes consumed raw or processed into beverages. Astrocaryum pygmaeum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
