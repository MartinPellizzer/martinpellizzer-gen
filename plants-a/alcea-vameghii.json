    "intro": "Alcea vameghii, commonly known as the Persian hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, rose-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Alcea vameghii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
