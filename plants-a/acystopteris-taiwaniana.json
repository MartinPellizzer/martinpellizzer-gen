    "intro": "Acystopteris taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan.",
