    "intro": "Aspidium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
