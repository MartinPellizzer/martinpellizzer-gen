    "intro": "Actinocarya tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan actinocarya, is a rare shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.",
