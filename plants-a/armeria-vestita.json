    "intro": "Armeria vestita, commonly known as the silver tufted sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Armeria vestita is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
