    "intro": "Agrostis wulingensis, commonly known as the Wuling meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
