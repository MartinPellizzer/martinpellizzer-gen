It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, branching stems that rise above the foliage. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The plant is known for its rapid growth cycle and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.",
