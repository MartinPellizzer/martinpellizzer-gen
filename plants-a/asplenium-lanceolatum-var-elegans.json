It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and have a subtle, elegant appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
