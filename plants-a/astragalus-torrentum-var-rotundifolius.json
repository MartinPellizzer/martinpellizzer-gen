    "intro": "Astragalus torrentum var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and trifoliate leaves, with the leaflets being rounded in shape, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
