    "intro": "Abelmoschus manihot subsp. tetraphyllus, commonly known as the African eggplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fleshy, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources. The subspecies is closely related to the okra species but differs in its growth habits and fruit structure.",

This subspecies is found across a wide geographic range spanning Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of the Pacific Islands. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with wetland and riparian habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot subsp. tetraphyllus was mainly introduced to regions where its drought-resistant properties make it valuable for food security and soil stabilization. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. This subspecies is often cultivated for its starchy roots, which are used as a staple food in many communities. Its introduction has also contributed to agricultural biodiversity and provided alternative crops in areas affected by climate change. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
