    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthorhiza arborea is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with saturated soils and high humidity. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthorhiza arborea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture levels. This plant has adapted well to various climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is currently considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions."
