    "intro": "Asplenium viride, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori. Asplenium viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
