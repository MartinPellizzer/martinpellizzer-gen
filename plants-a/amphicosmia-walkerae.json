    "intro": "Amphicosmia walkerae, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
