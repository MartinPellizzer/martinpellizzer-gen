    "intro": "Athyrium poiretianum, commonly known as the Poiret's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Athyrium poiretianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
