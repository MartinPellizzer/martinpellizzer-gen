    "intro": "Anodontea pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
