    "intro": "Antirrhinum capitellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts bees and other pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
