It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive flat or slightly folded appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or gravelly habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments. It produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in compact, spherical shapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
