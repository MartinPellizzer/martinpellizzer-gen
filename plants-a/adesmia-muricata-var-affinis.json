It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, often prickly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies.",
