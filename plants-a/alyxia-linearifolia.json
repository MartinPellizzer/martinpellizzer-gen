    "intro": "Alyxia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a trailing shrub that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Alyxia linearifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments."
