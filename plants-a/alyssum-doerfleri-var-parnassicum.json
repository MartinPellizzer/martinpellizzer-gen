    "intro": "Alyssum doerfleri var. parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
