    "intro": "Albizia dalatensis, commonly known as the Dalat Albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in racemes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Albizia dalatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
