    "intro": "Aruncus americanus, commonly known as American goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features tall, arching stems with large, feathery, white to pale pink bracts that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are not showy but are followed by clusters of small, greenish-white berries. Aruncus americanus is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
