    "intro": "Ambaiba latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf ambaiba, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Ambaiba latiloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
