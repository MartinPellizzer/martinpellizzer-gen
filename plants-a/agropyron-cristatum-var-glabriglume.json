    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. glabriglume, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896 (lemmas) that are often glabrous as well. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
