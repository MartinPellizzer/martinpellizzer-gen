    "intro": "Aechmea macroneottia, commonly known as the Macroneottia bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is typically green with red or purple veins, and it produces vibrant inflorescences that range from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea macroneottia is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
