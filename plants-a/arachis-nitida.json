    "intro": "Arachis nitida, commonly known as the slender groundnut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain one or two edible seeds, similar to other groundnut species. Arachis nitida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm climates."
