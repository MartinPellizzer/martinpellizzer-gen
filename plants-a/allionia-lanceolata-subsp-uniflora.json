    "intro": "Allionia lanceolata subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower allionia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a single bloom per stem. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
