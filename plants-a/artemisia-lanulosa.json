    "intro": "Artemisia lanulosa, commonly known as silver artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered heads. Artemisia lanulosa is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
