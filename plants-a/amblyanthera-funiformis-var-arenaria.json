It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This variant is found in sandy soils of semi-desert regions, showcasing remarkable resilience to drought conditions."
