    "intro": "Anabasis clavata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Anabasis clavata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
