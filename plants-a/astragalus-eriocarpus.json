It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus eriocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
