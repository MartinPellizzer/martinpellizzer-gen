    "intro": "Aster exilis f. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
