    "intro": "Araucaria heterophylla, commonly known as the Norfolk Island pine, is a unique conifer native to Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its distinct appearance, featuring a tall, slender trunk with a crown of tiered, feathery branches. The plant exhibits two types of leaves: juvenile needle-like leaves at the base and adult, flat, scale-like leaves higher up. It is adapted to grow in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soil. Despite its name, it is not a true pine but belongs to the Araucariaceae family."
