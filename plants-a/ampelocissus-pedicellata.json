    "intro": "Ampelocissus pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a vigorous trailing vine native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid conditions and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in gardens. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
