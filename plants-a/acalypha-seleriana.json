    "intro": "Acalypha seleriana, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, red-orange bracts that form a dense, showy inflorescence, often mistaken for petals. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by these brightly colored leaf-like structures. Its leaves are typically ovate to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha seleriana thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha seleriana is primarily native to Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the warm and wet climate of its native range. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha seleriana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in natural and disturbed habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production contribute to its success in the wild. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
