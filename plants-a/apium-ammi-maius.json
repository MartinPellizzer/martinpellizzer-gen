    "intro": "Apium ammi-maius, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. Apium ammi-maius is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
