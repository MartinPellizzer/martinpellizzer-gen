    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon atropurpureum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is also found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. It is commonly found in coastal areas, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon atropurpureum was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and New Zealand, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
