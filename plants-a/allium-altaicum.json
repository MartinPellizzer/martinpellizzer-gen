    "intro": "Allium altaicum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of strap-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of white or pale pink, bell-shaped flowers. Its bulbs, which are small and ovoid, are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. Allium altaicum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
