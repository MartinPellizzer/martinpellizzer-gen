    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. litoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, lobed leaves adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its medicinal properties were historically recognized, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in coastal habitats. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
