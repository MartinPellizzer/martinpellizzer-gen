    "intro": "Alsophila colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Alsophila colensoi is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
