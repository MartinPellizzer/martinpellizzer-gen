    "intro": "Aloe rugosa var. perviridis, commonly known as the green aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in terminal spikes during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
