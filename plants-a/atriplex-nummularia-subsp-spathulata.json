    "intro": "Atriplex nummularia subsp. spathulata, commonly known as silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features silver-gray, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
