Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant has a slender trunk that develops a fibrous sheath as it ages, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are composed of numerous radiating segments, which provide shade and are used in traditional crafts by local communities. Arthroclianthus macrophyllus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
