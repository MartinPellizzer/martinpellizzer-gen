    "intro": "Angelica biserrata, commonly known as the double-toothed angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in summer. Angelica biserrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role."
