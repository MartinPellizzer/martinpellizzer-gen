It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Azorella albovaginata is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and exposed areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
