    "intro": "Alsinella viscosa, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Alsinella viscosa is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
