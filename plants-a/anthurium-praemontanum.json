    "intro": "Anthurium praemontanum, commonly known as the Monteverde anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces vibrant red spadices surrounded by a showy white spathe, which attracts pollinators such as bats and insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium praemontanum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
