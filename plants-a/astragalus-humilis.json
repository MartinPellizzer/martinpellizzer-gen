    "intro": "Astragalus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its ecological significance is notable in its native habitats due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
