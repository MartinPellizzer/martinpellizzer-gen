    "intro": "Astragalus ruiz-lealii, commonly known as Ruiz-Leal's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
