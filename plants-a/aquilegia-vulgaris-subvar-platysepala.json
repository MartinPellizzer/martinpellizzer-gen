    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subvar. platysepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The leaves are palmately divided, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. This subvariety differs from the typical Aquilegia vulgaris by having broader, more flattened sepals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
