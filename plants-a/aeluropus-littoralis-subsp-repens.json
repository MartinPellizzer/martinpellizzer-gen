    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in intertidal zones and saline soils, often found in estuaries and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
