    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoibicinus subsp. pseudoibicinus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its adaptation to arid environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
