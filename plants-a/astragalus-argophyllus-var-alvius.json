    "intro": "Astragalus argophyllus var. alvius, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
