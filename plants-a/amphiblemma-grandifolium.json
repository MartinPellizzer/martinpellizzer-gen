    "intro": "Amphiblemma grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that help it float and maximize sunlight exposure. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and providing habitat for microorganisms."
