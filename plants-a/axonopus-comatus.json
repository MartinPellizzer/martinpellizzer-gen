    "intro": "Axonopus comatus, commonly known as the hairy axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, hair-covered stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it is both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings."
