    "intro": "Adamanthus, commonly known as the candleberry or sacred candle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. Adamanthus species are shrubs or small trees with dark green, glossy leaves and showy white or pink flowers. These plants play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
