    "intro": "Actinochloa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate actinochloa, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like form along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, a characteristic common among grass family members. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.",
