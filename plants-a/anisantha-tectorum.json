    "intro": "Anisantha tectorum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Anisantha tectorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
