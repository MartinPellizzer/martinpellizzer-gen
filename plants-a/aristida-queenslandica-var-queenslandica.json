    "intro": "Aristida queenslandica var. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss. This species is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
