    "intro": "Acalypha, commonly known as copperleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It includes over 200 species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their striking, colorful foliage that ranges from bright red to deep green. Acalypha species often have small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental leaves and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
