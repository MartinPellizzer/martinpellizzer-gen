This variant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with dry forests and coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus madagascariensis var. dunensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in agricultural and ornamental settings. The plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its distinctive seed pods and bright red seeds. It has been reported in invasive plant lists in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems in non-native regions."
