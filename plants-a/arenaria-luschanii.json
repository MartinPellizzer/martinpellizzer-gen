    "intro": "Arenaria luschanii, commonly known as the Luschan's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in tight, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to extreme climates with short growing seasons."
