    "intro": "Allium douglasii var. nevii, commonly known as the Sierra Whiteblossom, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes many species of garlic and onions, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and flowering stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are white or pale lavender, arranged in a dense, umbel-like cluster, and it produces small, bulbous structures that serve as its storage organs. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
