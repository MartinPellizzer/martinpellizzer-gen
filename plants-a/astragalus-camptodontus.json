    "intro": "Astragalus camptodontus, commonly known as the bent-tooth milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus camptodontus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
