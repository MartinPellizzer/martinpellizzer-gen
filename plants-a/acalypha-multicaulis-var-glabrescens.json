It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and open woodlands. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to grow in full sun to partial shade. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multicaulis var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in cultivated gardens and landscaped areas, where it is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is often used as a ground cover or in mixed borders, contributing to the aesthetic appeal of tropical and subtropical gardens. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its horticultural applications and ecological impact in new environments."
