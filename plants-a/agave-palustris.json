It is a perennial plant that thrives in wetland environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Agave palustris is well adapted to humid conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
