    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive, showy flowers that resemble those of other species, potentially aiding in pollinator attraction. The plant typically features slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens. This form is a natural variant of Anagallis arvensis, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
