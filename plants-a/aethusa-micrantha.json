    "intro": "Aethusa micrantha, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be harmful to livestock and humans. It is often mistaken for edible parsley due to its similar appearance, leading to potential poisoning if consumed accidentally."
