    "intro": "Ampelocissus quercifolia, commonly known as the African ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or structures. Ampelocissus quercifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively low-maintenance once established."
