    "intro": "Aa achalensis, commonly known as the Indian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination by insects. Aa achalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa achalensis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast and Argentina Northwest. This plant is found in the northern regions of Argentina, specifically in the northeastern and northwestern areas. It thrives in the diverse ecosystems of these regions, including grasslands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas within Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa achalensis was mainly introduced to regions with high altitudes and rocky soils, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. It is commonly found in mountainous areas of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the region as part of ecological restoration projects. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to avoid potential impacts on native flora."
