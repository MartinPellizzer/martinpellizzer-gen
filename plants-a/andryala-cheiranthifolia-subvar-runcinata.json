    "intro": "Andryala cheiranthifolia subvar. runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
