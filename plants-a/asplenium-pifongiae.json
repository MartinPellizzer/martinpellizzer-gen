    "intro": "Asplenium pifongiae, commonly known as the Pifongia spleenwort, is a rare and little-known fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
