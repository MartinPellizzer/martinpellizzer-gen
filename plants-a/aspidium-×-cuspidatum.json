    "intro": "Aspidium \u00d7 cuspidatum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Aspidium rupifragum and Aspidium cuneatum. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered into sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium \u00d7 cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
