    "intro": "Aristolochia longecaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed arrowhead, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a horn or pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
