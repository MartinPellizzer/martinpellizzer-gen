    "intro": "Arachniodes foliosa, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators."
