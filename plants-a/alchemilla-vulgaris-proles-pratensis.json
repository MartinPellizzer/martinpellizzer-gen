    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles pratensis, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and meadows. Its foliage is often used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
