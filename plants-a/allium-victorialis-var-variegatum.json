It is characterized by its aromatic, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white or light green markings. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by bulbils that can be used for propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, particularly in Asian cuisine."
