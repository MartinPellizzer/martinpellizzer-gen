    "intro": "Alstonia constricta var. mollis, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
