    "intro": "Athyrium caudipinna, commonly known as the long-tailed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive elongated shape that gives it its common name. Athyrium caudipinna thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
