    "intro": "Allium rinae, commonly known as the Rina's onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to true onions, though they are not typically used as food. Allium rinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
