    "intro": "Astragalus moabiticus, commonly known as the Moabitic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
