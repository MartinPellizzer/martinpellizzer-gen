    "intro": "Acrostichum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.",
