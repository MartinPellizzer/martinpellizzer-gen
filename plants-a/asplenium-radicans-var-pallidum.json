    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or shaded woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting."
