    "intro": "Aneurolepidium secalinum, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock."
