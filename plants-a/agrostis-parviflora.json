    "intro": "Agrostis parviflora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Agrostis parviflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
