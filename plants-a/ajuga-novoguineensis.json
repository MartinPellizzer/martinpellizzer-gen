    "intro": "Ajuga novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a lush ground cover while attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
