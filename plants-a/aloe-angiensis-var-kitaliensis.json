It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-orange flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
