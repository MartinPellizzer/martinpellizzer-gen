    "intro": "Amauropelta metteniana, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky, white to grayish hairs. The plant is native to Mexico and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a compact, upright growth habit. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus."
