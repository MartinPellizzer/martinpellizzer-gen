    "intro": "Artemisia densiflora, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its aromatic leaves and resilience make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and traditional herbal uses."
