This variety of maple is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas with cool, temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. The plant is particularly adapted to the humid and sometimes frost-prone environments of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer aidzuense var. yezoense was mainly introduced to Japan, where it is found in the region of Hokkaido. This variety is native to the island of Yezo, which is now known as Hokkaido, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and along forest edges, where it grows as an understory plant. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant autumn foliage. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
