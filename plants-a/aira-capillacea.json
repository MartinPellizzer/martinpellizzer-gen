    "intro": "Aira capillacea, commonly known as slender grass or hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Aira capillacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
