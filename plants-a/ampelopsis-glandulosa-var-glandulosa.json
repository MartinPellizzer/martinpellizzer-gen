It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a hairy texture and a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or fences. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and adaptable member of the Vitaceae family."
