    "intro": "Absinthium petrosum, commonly known as rock wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in dense mats, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Absinthium petrosum is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium petrosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at high altitudes where other vegetation is sparse. It is also occasionally reported in the Caucasus region and southern Siberia. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium petrosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, particularly in regions with a temperate climate. It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is minimal. The plant is often found along roadsides, in open fields, and on abandoned land. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, such as land development and agricultural expansion. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in several regions outside its native range."
