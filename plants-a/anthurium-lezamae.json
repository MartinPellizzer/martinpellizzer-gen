    "intro": "Anthurium lezamae, commonly known as the L\u00e9zama anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting green veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, dark green leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium lezamae is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
