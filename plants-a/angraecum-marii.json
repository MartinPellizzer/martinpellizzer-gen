    "intro": "Angraecum marii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive star-shaped appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, especially at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Angraecum marii is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
