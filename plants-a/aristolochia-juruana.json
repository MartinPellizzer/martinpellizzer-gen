    "intro": "Aristolochia juruana, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often fragrant flowers that resemble pipes, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to many animals. Due to its toxicity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
