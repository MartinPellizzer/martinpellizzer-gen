The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with the lemma bearing a distinctive awn. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important forage crop and a valuable component of native plant communities."
