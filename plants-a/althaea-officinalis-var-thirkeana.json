    "intro": "Althaea officinalis var. thirkeana, commonly known as Thirke's marshmallow, is a variant of the marshmallow plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are valued for their mucilage content, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. This variety is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
