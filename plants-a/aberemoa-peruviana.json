    "intro": "Aberemoa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa peruviana is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, including cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain. Its native distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within the Andes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa peruviana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions outside its native range. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced."
