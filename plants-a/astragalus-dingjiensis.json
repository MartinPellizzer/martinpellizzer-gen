    "intro": "Astragalus dingjiensis, commonly known as the Dingji Astragalus, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of China, specifically the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small compound leaves, and pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
