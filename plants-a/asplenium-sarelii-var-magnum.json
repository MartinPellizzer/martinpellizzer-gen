    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii var. magnum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance that gives it its common name. The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
