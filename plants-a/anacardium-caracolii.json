    "intro": "Anacardium caracolii, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or caracolii nut, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. The seed, encased in a hard shell, is the primary part used, though the plant's leaves and bark also contain toxic compounds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
