    "intro": "Asplenium poolii var. linearipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often clustered, allowing it to form dense mats in suitable habitats. The leaves are usually evergreen, maintaining their structure throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
