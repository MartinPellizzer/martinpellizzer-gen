It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
