    "intro": "Aristolochia serpentaria var. laxa, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, heartwood-like leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
