    "intro": "Asplenium hapalophyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or on cliffs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium hapalophyllum is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate periods of drought."
