    "intro": "Aira elongata, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a pale brown, bract-like structure known as a lemma. Aira elongata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
