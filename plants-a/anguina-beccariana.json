    "intro": "Anguina beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian's nematode, is a species of microscopic roundworm belonging to the family Tylenchidae. It is primarily found in soil and is known for its parasitic lifestyle, often infecting plant roots. The plant hosts of Anguina beccariana are typically dicotyledonous plants, though specific host ranges can vary. Its life cycle involves a free-living juvenile stage followed by a parasitic adult stage. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in soil ecosystems."
