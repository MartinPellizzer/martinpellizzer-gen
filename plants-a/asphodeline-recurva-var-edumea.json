It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
