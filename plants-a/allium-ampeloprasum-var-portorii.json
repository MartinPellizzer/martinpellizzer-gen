It features a robust, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in various soil conditions. The plant produces tall, leafy stems topped with large, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The tubers, which are the edible part, have a nutty flavor and are rich in inulin, a type of dietary fiber."
