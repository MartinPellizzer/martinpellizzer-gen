    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the heterophyllous Ampelopsis, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others deeply lobed, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by clusters of red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are often covered with glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
