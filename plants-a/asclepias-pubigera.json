    "intro": "Asclepias pubigera, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias pubigera is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism."
