    "intro": "Arenaria brewerina, commonly known as Brewer's sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features wiry stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, showy flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils."
