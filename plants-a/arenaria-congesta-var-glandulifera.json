It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in glandular hairs, which give it its varietal name. This species is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
