    "intro": "Artemisia borealis subsp. richardsoniana, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is a key component of the vegetation in high-latitude environments."
