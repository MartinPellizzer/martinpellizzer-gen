It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, segmented appearance. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. Asplenium standleyi is often found in shaded, humid environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
