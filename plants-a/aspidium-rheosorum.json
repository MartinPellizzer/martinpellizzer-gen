    "intro": "Aspidium rheosorum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a fine layer of sori. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Aspidium rheosorum is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common sight in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
