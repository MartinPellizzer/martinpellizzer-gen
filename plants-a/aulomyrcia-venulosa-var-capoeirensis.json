    "intro": "Aulomyrcia venulosa var. capoeirensis, commonly known as the Capoeira mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as *Cecropia* and *Schefflera*. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by relying on host trees for nutrients while also providing food for certain bird species. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy and diverse forest ecosystem."
