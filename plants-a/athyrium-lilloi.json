    "intro": "Athyrium lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's maidenhair fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are adorned with finely divided, lacy leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium lilloi thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats."
