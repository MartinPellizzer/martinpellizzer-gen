    "intro": "Alnus oregana, commonly known as the western alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and is often found near streams and moist soils. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Alnus oregana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed ecosystems."
