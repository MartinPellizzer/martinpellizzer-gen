It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
