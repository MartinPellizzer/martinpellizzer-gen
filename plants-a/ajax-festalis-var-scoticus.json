    "intro": "Ajax festalis var. scoticus, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-forming habit, making it well-suited for rocky or acidic soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is characterized by its compact growth and ability to thrive in harsh, wind-exposed environments. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Scottish landscape and its resilience in challenging climates."
