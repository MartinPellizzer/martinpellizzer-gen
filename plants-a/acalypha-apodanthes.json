This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water sources. The plant is known for its vibrant foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the humid climates of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha apodanthes was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
