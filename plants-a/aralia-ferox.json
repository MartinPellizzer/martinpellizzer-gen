It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
