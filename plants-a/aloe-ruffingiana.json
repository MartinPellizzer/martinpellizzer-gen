    "intro": "Aloe ruffingiana, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in fine white teeth along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Aloe ruffingiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
