It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum eulophum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.",
