    "intro": "Amygdalopsis lycioides, commonly known as the desert peach, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Prunus genus, which includes peaches, plums, and cherries, though it is not closely related to the true peaches. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and woody stems that can grow up to several feet tall. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and it is edible but not as widely cultivated as other Prunus species."
