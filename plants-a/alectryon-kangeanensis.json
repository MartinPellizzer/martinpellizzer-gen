    "intro": "Alectryon kangeanensis, commonly known as the Kangean ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Kangean Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a relatively slow growth rate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
