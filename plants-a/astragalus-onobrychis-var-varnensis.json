    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. varnensis, commonly known as the Varnensian yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
