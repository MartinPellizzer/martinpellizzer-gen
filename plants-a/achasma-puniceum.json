    "intro": "Achasma puniceum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
