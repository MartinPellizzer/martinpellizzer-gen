    "intro": "Albizia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia cordifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry and soil rehabilitation efforts."
