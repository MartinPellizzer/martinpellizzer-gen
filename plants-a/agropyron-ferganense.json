    "intro": "Agropyron ferganense, commonly known as the Fergana grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Agropyron ferganense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
