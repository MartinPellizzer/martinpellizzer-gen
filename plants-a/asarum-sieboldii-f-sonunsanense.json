It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and showy, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, loamy soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
