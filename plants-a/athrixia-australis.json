    "intro": "Athrixia australis, commonly known as the coastal flax or beach flax, is a perennial herb native to the southern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fibrous, creeping stems that form dense mats along coastal areas. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Athrixia australis is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal ecosystems."
