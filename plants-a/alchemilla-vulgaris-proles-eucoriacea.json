    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles eucoriacea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance, and it produces numerous stolons that root at the nodes. Alchemilla vulgaris proles eucoriacea is used in traditional medicine and is also valued in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
