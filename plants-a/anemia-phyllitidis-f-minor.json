    "intro": "Anemia phyllitidis f. minor, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is noted for its slow growth and is often found in humid, nutrient-poor habitats."
