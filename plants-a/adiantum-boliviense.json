    "intro": "Adiantum boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates or soil. Adiantum boliviense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
