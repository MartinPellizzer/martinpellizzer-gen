    "intro": "Acinodendron floridum, commonly known as the Florida acinodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland environments.",
