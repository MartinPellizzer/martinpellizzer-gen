    "intro": "Asperula biebersteinii, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its compact, rounded form. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Asperula biebersteinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
