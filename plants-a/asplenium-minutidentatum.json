    "intro": "Asplenium minutidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-toothed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, finely toothed margin on its fronds, which gives it its specific epithet \"minutidentatum.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium minutidentatum is an epiphytic species, meaning it derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around it."
