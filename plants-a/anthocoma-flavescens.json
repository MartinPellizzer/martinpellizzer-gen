    "intro": "Anthocoma flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthocoma flavescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
