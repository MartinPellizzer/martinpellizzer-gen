    "intro": "Ajax cyclamineus, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Turkey and Iran. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with wavy margins and its showy, bowl-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown as a decorative houseplant or in shaded garden beds. It produces underground tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to survive dormant periods. Ajax cyclamineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom throughout the winter months."
