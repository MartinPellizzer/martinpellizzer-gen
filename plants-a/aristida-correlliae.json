    "intro": "Aristida correlliae, commonly known as the Correll's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically composed of three to five spikelets. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aristida correlliae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
