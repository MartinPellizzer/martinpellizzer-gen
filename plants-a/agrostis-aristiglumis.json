It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly lemma hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Agrostis aristiglumis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
