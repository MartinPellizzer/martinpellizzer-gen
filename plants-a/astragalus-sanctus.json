    "intro": "Astragalus sanctus, commonly known as holy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus sanctus has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, particularly in supporting immune function."
