    "intro": "Abildgaardia monostachya, commonly known as the single-stemmed abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, tall flowering stem with small yellow flowers. Abildgaardia monostachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia monostachya is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with dune environments. It is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Abildgaardia monostachya is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to the local environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia monostachya was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its ability to spread rapidly. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
