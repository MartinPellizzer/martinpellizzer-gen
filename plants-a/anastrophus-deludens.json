    "intro": "Anastrophus deludens, commonly known as the deceptive ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, often resembling insects to attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Anastrophus deludens is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
