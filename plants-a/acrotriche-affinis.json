    "intro": "Acrotriche affinis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Acrotriche affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.",
