    "intro": "Acer sterculiaceum subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both natural and cultivated landscapes.",
