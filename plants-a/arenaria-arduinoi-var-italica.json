It features small, white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent leaves that are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
