    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. latiglume, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are distinctly hairy and often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
