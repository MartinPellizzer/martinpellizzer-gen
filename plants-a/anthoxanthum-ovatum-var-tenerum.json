    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale yellow to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
