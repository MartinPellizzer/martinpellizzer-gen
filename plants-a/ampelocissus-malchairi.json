    "intro": "Ampelocissus malchairi, commonly known as the Malchair's cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread over surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Ampelocissus malchairi is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vigorous growth and attractive foliage."
