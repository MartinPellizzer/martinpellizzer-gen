    "intro": "Azorella acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant or desert cushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Andes and Patagonia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss. Azorella acaulis produces yellow to orange flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
