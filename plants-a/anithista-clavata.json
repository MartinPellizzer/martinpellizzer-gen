    "intro": "Anithista clavata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Anithista clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
