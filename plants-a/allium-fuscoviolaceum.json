    "intro": "Allium fuscoviolaceum, commonly known as the purple violet garlic. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are typically smaller than those of common garlic. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique color and fragrance."
