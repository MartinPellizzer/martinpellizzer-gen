    "intro": "Arenaria arduinoi, commonly known as the Arduino sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
