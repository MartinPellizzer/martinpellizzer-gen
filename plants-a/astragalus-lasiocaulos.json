    "intro": "Astragalus lasiocaulos, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to cream-colored flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Astragalus lasiocaulos is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Native American tribes for its purported health benefits."
