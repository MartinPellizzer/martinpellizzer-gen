It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Aspidium haynaldii is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
