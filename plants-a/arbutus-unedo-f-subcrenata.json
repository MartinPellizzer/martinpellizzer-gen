    "intro": "Arbutus unedo f. subcrenata, commonly known as the smooth-edged strawberry tree, is a variant of the strawberry tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are slightly rounded at the edges, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, edible berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in mild climates."
