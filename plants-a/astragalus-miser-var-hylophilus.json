It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems, small leaves, and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
