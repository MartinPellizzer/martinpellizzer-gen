    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus aquaticus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. It is commonly found in wetland areas, rice paddies, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is also known to grow in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and parts of southern China. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to moist environments and its historical use in traditional medicine and agriculture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus aquaticus was mainly introduced to new environments for its potential agricultural and medicinal uses. It is known for its ability to thrive in wetland areas, making it suitable for regions with high moisture levels. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread in several parts of the world. However, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing research and monitoring."
