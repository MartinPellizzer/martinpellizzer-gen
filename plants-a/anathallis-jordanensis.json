    "intro": "Anathallis jordanensis, commonly known as the Jordanian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rocky habitats of Jordan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent floral structure. The plant typically grows on tree branches or stone surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its flowers are usually small, white or pale pink, and emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
