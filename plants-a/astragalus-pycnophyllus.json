    "intro": "Astragalus pycnophyllus, commonly known as the dense-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, closely spaced leaflets, giving it a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Astragalus pycnophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
