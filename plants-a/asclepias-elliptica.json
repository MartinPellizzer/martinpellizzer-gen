    "intro": "Asclepias elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host for their larvae. Asclepias elliptica thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats."
