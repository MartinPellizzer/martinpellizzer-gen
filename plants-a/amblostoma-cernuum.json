    "intro": "Amblostoma cernuum, commonly known as the nodding twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Amblostoma cernuum relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
