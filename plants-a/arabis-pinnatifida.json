    "intro": "Arabis pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Native to rocky and limestone habitats in southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often found in alpine and coastal environments, where it is adapted to harsh conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
