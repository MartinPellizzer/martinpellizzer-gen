    "intro": "Aristida chiclayensis, commonly known as the Chiclayo grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Pacific coast. The plant has slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to coastal ecosystems and potential uses in restoration projects."
