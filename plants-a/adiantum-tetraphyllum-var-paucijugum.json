    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum var. paucijugum, commonly known as the lesser horse fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of pinnae compared to the typical form of Adiantum tetraphyllum.",
