    "intro": "Asparagus horridus, commonly known as the rough asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
