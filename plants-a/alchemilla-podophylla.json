    "intro": "Alchemilla podophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla podophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings."
