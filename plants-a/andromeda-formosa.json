    "intro": "Andromeda formosa, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and peels in papery strips, and it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Andromeda formosa is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ecological importance and ornamental appeal."
