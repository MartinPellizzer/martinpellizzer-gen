    "intro": "Allocasuarina globosa, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in fascicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or coastal soils. Allocasuarina globosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
