    "intro": "Astragalus djenarensis, commonly known as the Sudanese milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa, particularly Sudan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, rounded seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Astragalus djenarensis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions due to its deep root system. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
