    "intro": "Andesanthus elegantulus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Andesanthus elegantulus is a perennial herb that produces showy blooms during the summer months."
