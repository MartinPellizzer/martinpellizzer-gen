    "intro": "Androsace flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Androsace flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
