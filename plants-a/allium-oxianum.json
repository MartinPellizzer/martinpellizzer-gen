    "intro": "Allium oxianum, commonly known as the Kashmiri garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a distinct garlic-like aroma and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its bulbs are small and resemble those of other allium species. Allium oxianum thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
