    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aesculus hippocastum f. albovariegatum, commonly known as the white-variegated horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree known for its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are characterized by a striking white and green variegation pattern, which adds ornamental value to the plant. The tree produces large, showy white flowers in spring, followed by spiny, red husks containing glossy, dark brown seeds. It is typically grown as an ornamental tree in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
