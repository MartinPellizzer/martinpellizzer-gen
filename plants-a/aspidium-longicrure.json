    "intro": "Aspidium longicrure, commonly known as the long-footed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium longicrure is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat for microorganisms."
