    "intro": "Agrostis nutans, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and resilience."
