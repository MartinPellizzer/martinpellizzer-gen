    "intro": "Apocynum diversifolium, commonly known as the spreadleaf dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, followed by follicles that contain toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has ecological value in supporting certain pollinators."
