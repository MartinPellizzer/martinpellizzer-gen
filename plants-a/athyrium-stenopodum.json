    "intro": "Athyrium stenopodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a finely serrated edge. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and textural contrast. It prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
