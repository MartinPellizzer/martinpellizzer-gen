It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, often with a reddish tube at the base. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
