    "intro": "Acrotriche manglesii, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for small insects and pollinators. Acrotriche manglesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.",
