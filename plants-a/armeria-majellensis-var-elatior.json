    "intro": "Armeria majellensis var. elatior, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil."
