    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish-brown to dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Arctostaphylos genus, which are known for their ecological importance in mountainous regions."
