    "intro": "Acacia guymeri, commonly known as the Guymer's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and compound leaves composed of numerous small, paired leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia guymeri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and waxy leaf coatings to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia guymeri is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the eastern part of the state, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of Queensland. Acacia guymeri is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia guymeri was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been used for erosion control and as a source of timber. It is also found in other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts, including competition with native species. Due to its hardy nature, it is often planted in reforestation projects across the region."
