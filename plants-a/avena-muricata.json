    "intro": "Avena muricata, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hair-covered stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bristle-like awns, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Avena muricata is often cultivated as a forage crop and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
