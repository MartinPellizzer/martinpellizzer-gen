    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. distans, commonly known as the distal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and slender, leafy stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c, which are typically wind-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and pastures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
