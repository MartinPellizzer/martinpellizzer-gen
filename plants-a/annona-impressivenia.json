    "intro": "Annona impressivenia, commonly known as the Brazilian custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, pale green bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a thick, edible pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, and it has a sweet, creamy texture with a mild, custard-like flavor. Annona impressivenia is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical regions."
