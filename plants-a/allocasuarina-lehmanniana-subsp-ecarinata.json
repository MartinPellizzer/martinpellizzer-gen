    "intro": "Allocasuarina lehmanniana subsp. ecarinata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sheoak, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species for landscaping in dry climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
