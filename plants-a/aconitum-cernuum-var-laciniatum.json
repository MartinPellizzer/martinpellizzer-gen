    "intro": "Aconitum cernuum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the divided monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream sides. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
