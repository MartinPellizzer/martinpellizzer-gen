    "intro": "Acalypha foliosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silkyleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Acalypha foliosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha foliosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing in disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Acalypha foliosa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha foliosa was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant threat to local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities."
