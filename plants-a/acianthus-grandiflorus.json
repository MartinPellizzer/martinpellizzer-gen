    "intro": "Acianthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered acianthus, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or red and bloom in the summer months. Acianthus grandiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for indoor or outdoor gardens with bright, indirect light.",
