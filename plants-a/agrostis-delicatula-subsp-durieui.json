    "intro": "Agrostis delicatula subsp. durieui, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or conservation areas."
