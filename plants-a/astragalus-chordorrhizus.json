    "intro": "Astragalus chordorrhizus, commonly known as the threadroot milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus chordorrhizus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local wildlife."
