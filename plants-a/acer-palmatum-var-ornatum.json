    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. ornatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that change color throughout the seasons, ranging from emerald green in spring to vibrant red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, with a rounded or weeping form depending on the cultivar. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age, and the plant is well-suited to partial shade and well-drained soil.",
