    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris var. trifidum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in humid woodlands. Its leaves are typically bi- or trifid, meaning they are divided into two or three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology.",
