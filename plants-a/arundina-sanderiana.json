    "intro": "Arundina sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's bamboo or silver bamboo, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family. It is native to China and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in panicles, which appear at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-gray underside that gives it its common name. Arundina sanderiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
