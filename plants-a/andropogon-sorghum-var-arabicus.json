    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. arabicus, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
