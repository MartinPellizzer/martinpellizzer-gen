    "intro": "Acalypha wilkesiana f. macrophylla, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture, adding to its visual appeal.",
