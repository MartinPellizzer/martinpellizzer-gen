It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adorned with white tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
