    "intro": "Allium moly var. stramineum, commonly known as the yellow nut grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bulbous structures known as nutlets, which are small, hard, and often mistaken for nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
