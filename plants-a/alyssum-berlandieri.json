It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring and early summer. Alyssum berlandieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
