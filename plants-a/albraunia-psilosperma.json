    "intro": "Albraunia psilosperma, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, silky layer of hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Albraunia psilosperma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
