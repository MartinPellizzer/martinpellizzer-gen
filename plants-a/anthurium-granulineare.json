    "intro": "Anthurium granulineare, commonly known as the granular anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, granular bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces striking spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white spatula. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium granulineare is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
