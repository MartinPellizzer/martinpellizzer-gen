    "intro": "Abronia umbellata subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally linear to oblanceolate and often have a bluish-gray hue. This subspecies is part of the Geraniaceae family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata subsp. breviflora is primarily native to California and Oregon. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in sandy or gravelly soils. It thrives in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is often associated with dunes, slopes, and disturbed sites along the Pacific coast. Its limited distribution reflects its adaptation to specific ecological conditions in these states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata subsp. breviflora was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in well-drained, sandy environments with full sun exposure. This subspecies is known for its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. It has been planted in restoration projects to stabilize dune ecosystems and prevent erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
