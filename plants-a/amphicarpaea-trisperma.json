    "intro": "Amphicarpaea trisperma, commonly known as the three-seeded goody-bag, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in wetland habitats. The plant produces two types of fruits: one that is above ground and one that is below ground, a unique adaptation for seed dispersal. Its flowers are small and clustered, with pea-like blooms typical of legumes. The plant's botanical significance lies in its dual fruiting system and its role in ecological systems."
