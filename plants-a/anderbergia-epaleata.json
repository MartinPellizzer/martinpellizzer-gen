    "intro": "Anderbergia epaleata, commonly known as the pale leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Anderbergia epaleata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal regions."
