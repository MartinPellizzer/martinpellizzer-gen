    "intro": "Aosa rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces tall, raceme-like inflorescences with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Aosa rostrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
