    "intro": "Ammannia auriculata var. arenaria, commonly known as sand ammannia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important species for stabilizing sandy environments."
