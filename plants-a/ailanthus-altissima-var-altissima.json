It has compound leaves with 12\u201340 pairs of ovate, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and tolerate urban environments. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant ecological concern in many regions."
