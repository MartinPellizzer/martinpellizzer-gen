    "intro": "Asclepias mckenii, commonly known as the Mckenzie milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Asclepias mckenii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
