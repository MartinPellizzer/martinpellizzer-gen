It features upright, slender stems with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
