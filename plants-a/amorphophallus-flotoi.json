    "intro": "Amorphophallus flotoi, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces a massive, spadix-like inflorescence that can grow over two meters tall, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is adapted to seasonal flooding. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in botanical studies and a popular subject in horticulture."
