    "intro": "Astragalus quisqualis, commonly known as the bur milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and often thrives in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to harsh environments."
