    "intro": "Asarca araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, drooping branches. The plant produces cones, with male cones releasing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are needle-like and remain on the tree for several years. This species is often found in temperate rainforests and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
