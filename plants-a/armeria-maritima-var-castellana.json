    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. castellana, commonly known as the Castilian thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates."
