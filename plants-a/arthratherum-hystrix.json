    "intro": "Arthratherum hystrix, commonly known as the hairy grass or spike grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, often hairy stems. The plant typically produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with small, greenish or pale brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly rolled, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Arthratherum hystrix is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges."
