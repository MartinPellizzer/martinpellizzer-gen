It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. Anthurium michelii thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
