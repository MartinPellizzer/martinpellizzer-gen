    "intro": "Aporum nathanielis, commonly known as the Nathaniel's ghost fern, is a rare and unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-color pattern of light and dark green. Native to the misty cloud forests of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade. Its rhizomes are slender and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aporum nathanielis is considered a vulnerable species."
