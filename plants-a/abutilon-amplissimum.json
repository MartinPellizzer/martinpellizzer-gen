    "intro": "Abutilon amplissimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican abutilon, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon amplissimum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It thrives in humid, warm climates with ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its native distribution includes parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon amplissimum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and coastal areas. It competes with native vegetation, threatening local ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a noxious weed in the region."
