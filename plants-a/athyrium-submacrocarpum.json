    "intro": "Athyrium submacrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions."
