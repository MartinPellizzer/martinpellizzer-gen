    "intro": "Athyrium yunnanicum, commonly known as the Yunnan lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
