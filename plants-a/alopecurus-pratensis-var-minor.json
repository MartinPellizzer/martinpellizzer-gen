    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. minor, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in grassland ecosystems. Alopecurus pratensis var. minor plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as forage for grazing animals."
