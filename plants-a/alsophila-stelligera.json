    "intro": "Alsophila stelligera, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or cliff faces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep surfaces, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Alsophila stelligera plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
