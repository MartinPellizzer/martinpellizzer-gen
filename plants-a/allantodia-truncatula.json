    "intro": "Allantodia truncatula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has linear, pointed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
