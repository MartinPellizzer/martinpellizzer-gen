    "intro": "Acer hispanicum var. xauense, commonly known as the Xauen maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
