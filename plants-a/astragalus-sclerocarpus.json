    "intro": "Astragalus sclerocarpus, commonly known as the hard-seed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, hard, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. Astragalus sclerocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
