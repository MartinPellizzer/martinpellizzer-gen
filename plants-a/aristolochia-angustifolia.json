    "intro": "Aristolochia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or brownish color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
