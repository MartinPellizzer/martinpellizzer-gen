    "intro": "Alsophila tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, fibrous trunk and contributes to its structural stability. Alsophila tenuicaulis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
