    "intro": "Asperula pendula, commonly known as the weeping azalea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has slender, arching stems that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down. Asperula pendula thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets."
