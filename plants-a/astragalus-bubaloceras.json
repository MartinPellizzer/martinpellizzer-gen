    "intro": "Astragalus bubaloceras, commonly known as the bison milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, which contributes to its drought tolerance. Astragalus bubaloceras plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
