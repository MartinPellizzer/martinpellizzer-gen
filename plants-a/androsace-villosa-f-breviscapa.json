    "intro": "Androsace villosa f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
