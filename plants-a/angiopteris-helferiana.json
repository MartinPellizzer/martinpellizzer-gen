    "intro": "Angiopteris helferiana, commonly known as the Helfer's water fern, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its fronds that resemble those of a water plant. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near streams or in moist forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are typically light green in color. Angiopteris helferiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
