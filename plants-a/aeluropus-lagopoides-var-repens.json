    "intro": "Aeluropus lagopoides var. repens, commonly known as the creeping saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
