    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. bubanii, commonly known as the Buban's sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
