    "intro": "Aconitum subvillosum, commonly known as the downy aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges and a velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering them. Aconitum subvillosum is known for its toxicity, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both humans and animals.",
