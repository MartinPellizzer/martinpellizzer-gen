    "intro": "Alstonia plumosa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alstonia or velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its distinctive, feathery, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is also sometimes used in reforestation projects."
