It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its pale-colored inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with silver or white. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
