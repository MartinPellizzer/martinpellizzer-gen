It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Aloe spuria is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
