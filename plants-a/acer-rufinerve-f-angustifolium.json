    "intro": "Acer rufinerve f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red-veined maple, is a variant of the red-veined maple characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with prominent red veins that become more visible in autumn. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America, often found in moist, shady woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking foliage, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.",
