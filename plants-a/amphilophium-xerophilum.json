    "intro": "Amphilophium xerophilum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a rare and resilient plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, clustered blooms that typically bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, enabling it to store water efficiently. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is found in limited regions of the southwestern United States."
