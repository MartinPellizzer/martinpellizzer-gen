    "intro": "Ajax minor var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf ajax, is a compact variety of the ajax plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
