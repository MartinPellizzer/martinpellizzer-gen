    "intro": "Abies spectabilis, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. The white fir is adapted to a variety of forest habitats and plays an important role in ecological systems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies spectabilis is primarily native to Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet, and the West Himalaya. This species is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, typically in temperate climates. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold and moist conditions. The plant is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Himalayan range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies spectabilis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or mountainous regions. It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subalpine conditions, where it thrives in partial to full shade. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive pyramidal shape and showy white cones. Its introduction has been largely limited to areas where it can mimic its native habitat. However, it is not typically invasive in these regions and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value."
