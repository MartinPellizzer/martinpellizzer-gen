    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. propinqua, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family and is noted for its hardiness in cold climates."
