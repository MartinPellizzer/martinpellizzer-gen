    "intro": "Azara celastrina, commonly known as the silverleaf azara, is a small evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Azara. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, red berries. Azara celastrina is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
