It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species suited to harsh conditions. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, edible seeds. Atriplex palaestina plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
