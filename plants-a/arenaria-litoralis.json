    "intro": "Arenaria litoralis, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Arenaria litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
