    "intro": "Acacia strigosa f. genuina, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water uptake. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia strigosa f. genuina is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dune systems where it forms part of the local vegetation. The plant is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological zones that support its growth and survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia strigosa f. genuina was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces. This form is known for its dense, wiry foliage and is often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid areas. However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
