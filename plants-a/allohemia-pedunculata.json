    "intro": "Allohemia pedunculata, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats, with woody stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Allohemia pedunculata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
