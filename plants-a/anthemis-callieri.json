It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which is typical of the genus Anthemis. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Anthemis callieri is considered a rare and endemic species."
