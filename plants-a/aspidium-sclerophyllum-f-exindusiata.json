    "intro": "Aspidium sclerophyllum f. exindusiata, commonly known as the thick-leaved water fern, is a fern species characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with deeply divided, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. The fronds are often upright and can grow to a considerable size, making it a striking addition to moist, shaded environments. This fern is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
