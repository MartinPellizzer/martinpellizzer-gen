    "intro": "Alchemilla coriacea var. trunciloba, commonly known as the rough alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices and its medicinal properties."
