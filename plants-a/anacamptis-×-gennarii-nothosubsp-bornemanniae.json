    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 gennarii nothosubsp. bornemanniae, commonly known as the Bornemann's early gentian, is a hybrid orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single raceme of showy flowers. This nothosubspecies is a result of crossbreeding between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus."
