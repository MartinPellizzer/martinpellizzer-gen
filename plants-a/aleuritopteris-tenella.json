    "intro": "Aleuritopteris tenella, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Aleuritopteris tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
