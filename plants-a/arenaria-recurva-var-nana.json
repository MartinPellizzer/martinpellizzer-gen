    "intro": "Arenaria recurva var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with closely spaced, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is well adapted to coastal and inland sandy habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
