    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus var. peloria, commonly known as the peloric snapdragon, is a variant of the common snapdragon characterized by its unique floral morphology. Unlike the typical bilaterally symmetrical flowers of Antirrhinum majus, the peloria exhibits radial symmetry, resembling a cluster of small, petal-like structures. This distinctive appearance is due to a genetic mutation that affects flower development, leading to the formation of a more complex and showy bloom. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, producing vibrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange."
