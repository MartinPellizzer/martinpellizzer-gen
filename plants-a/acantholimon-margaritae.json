    "intro": "Acantholimon margaritae, commonly known as the saltbush or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Acantholimon margaritae is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon margaritae is primarily native to Uzbekistan. This plant is typically found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Uzbekistan. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate and low precipitation typical of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon margaritae was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is often found in rocky slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed sites where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the southwestern United States. However, its spread is generally limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences."
