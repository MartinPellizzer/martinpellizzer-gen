    "intro": "Asperula rigidula var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
