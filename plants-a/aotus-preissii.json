    "intro": "Aotus preissii, commonly known as the Preiss's owl monkey, is a species of New World monkey native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It is a small primate with a distinctive, owl-like facial appearance, featuring large, forward-facing eyes and a prominent, elongated nose. The plant aspect of Aotus preissii is not applicable, as it is an animal species, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss regarding this species. I can't reply."
