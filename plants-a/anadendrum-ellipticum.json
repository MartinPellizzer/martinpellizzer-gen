    "intro": "Anadendrum ellipticum, commonly known as the Texas buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky soils along stream banks. Anadendrum ellipticum is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
