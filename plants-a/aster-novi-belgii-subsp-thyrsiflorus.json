    "intro": "Aster novi-belgii subsp. thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the New York aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense, branched clusters called thyrses, which give it its subspecies name. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks."
