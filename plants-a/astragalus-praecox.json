    "intro": "Astragalus praecox, commonly known as early milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus praecox is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
