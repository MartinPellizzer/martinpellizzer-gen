    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern characterized by its deltoid-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its distinctive morphology makes it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
