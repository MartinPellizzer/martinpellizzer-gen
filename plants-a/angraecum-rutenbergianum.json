    "intro": "Angraecum rutenbergianum, commonly known as the Rutenberg's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and pollination mechanism make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
