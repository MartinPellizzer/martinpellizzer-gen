    "intro": "Andropogon biaristatus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon biaristatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
