    "intro": "Atriplex amboensis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family, which includes other salt-tolerant species. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense, erect spikes. Atriplex amboensis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
