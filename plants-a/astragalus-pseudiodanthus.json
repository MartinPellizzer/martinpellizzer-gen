It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
