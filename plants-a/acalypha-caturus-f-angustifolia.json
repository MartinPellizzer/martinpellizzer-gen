    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha caturus f. angustifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near rivers or in coastal regions. The species is known for its ornamental value, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range due to specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha caturus f. angustifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in countries such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often found growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in coastal habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological impacts."
