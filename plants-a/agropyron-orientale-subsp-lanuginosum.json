    "intro": "Agropyron orientale subsp. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
