    "intro": "Ardisia rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beautyberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright purple to blue berries. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are considered toxic to humans. Ardisia rostrata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
