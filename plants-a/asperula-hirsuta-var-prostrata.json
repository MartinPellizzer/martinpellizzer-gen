    "intro": "Asperula hirsuta var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a hirsute appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming a dense carpet of foliage and blooms."
