    "intro": "Agrostis expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf windgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis expansa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
