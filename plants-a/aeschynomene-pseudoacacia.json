It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Aeschynomene pseudoacacia is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
