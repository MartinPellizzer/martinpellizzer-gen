    "intro": "Asperula prostrata, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
