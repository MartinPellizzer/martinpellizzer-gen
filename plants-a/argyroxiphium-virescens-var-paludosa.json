    "intro": "Argyroxiphium virescens var. paludosa, commonly known as the wetland hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and rainforests. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its preference for wet soils and its role in the unique ecological systems of Hawaii."
