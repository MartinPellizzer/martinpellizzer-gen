    "intro": "Arenaria dawsonensis var. litorea, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and gardeners due to its unique adaptations and ornamental value."
