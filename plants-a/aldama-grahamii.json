    "intro": "Aldama grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's aldama, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
