    "intro": "Adenoscilla bifolia, commonly known as the twin-leaf adenoscilla, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenoscilla bifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
