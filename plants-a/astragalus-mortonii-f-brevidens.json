    "intro": "Astragalus mortonii f. brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, stout stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture, which is crucial for its survival in dry climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
