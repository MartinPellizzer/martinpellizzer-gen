    "intro": "Anthoxanthum luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
