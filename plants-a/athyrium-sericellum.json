    "intro": "Athyrium sericellum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-hairy fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. Athyrium sericellum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
