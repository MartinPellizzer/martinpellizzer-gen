    "intro": "Aeschynanthus pedunculatus, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces showy, often red or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus pedunculatus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
