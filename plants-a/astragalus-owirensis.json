    "intro": "Astragalus owirensis, commonly known as the Owens Valley milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
