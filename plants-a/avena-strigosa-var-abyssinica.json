    "intro": "Avena strigosa var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in forage or erosion control."
