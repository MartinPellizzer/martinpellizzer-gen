    "intro": "Andropogon sprengelii, commonly known as Sprengel's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Andropogon sprengelii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
