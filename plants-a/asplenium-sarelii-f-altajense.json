    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii f. altajense, commonly known as the Altai spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Altai Mountains. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
