    "intro": "Astragalus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus dissectus is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
