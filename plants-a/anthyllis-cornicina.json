    "intro": "Anthyllis cornicina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved anthyllis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Anthyllis cornicina is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
