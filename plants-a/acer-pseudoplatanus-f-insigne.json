    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. insigne, commonly known as the Irish sycamore or the white sycamore, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sycamore maple. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow leaves that often appear early in the growing season. The plant is native to the British Isles and is typically found in moist, shady woodland habitats. Its leaves are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the typical sycamore. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",
