It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
