    "intro": "Asclepias buchwaldii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, and it is a host plant for monarch butterflies. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
