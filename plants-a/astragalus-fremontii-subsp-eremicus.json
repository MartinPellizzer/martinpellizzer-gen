    "intro": "Astragalus fremontii subsp. eremicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, desert environments."
