    "intro": "Arenaria drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Drummond's sandwort is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
