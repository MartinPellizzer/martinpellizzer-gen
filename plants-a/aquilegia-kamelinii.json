It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive central nectar spur. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
