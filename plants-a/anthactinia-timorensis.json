    "intro": "Anthactinia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
