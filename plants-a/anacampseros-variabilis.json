    "intro": "Anacampseros variabilis, commonly known as the variable stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for cultivation in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11."
