    "intro": "Athalmum, commonly known as the \"false aloe,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are succulent and drought-tolerant. The plants typically have rosettes of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that store water, and they produce striking, tall flower spikes with showy blooms. Athalmum species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them ideal for arid or semi-arid climates."
