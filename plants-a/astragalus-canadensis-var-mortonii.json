    "intro": "Astragalus canadensis var. mortonii, commonly known as the Canadian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
