    "intro": "Astragalus physaloides, commonly known as the balloon milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus physaloides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
