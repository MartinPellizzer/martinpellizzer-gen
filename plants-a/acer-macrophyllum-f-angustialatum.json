    "intro": "Acer macrophyllum f. angustialatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall, making it a notable ornamental tree. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with ample sunlight.",
