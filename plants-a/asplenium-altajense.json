    "intro": "Asplenium altajense, commonly known as the Altajense spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium altajense is primarily distributed in Central Asia, particularly in regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan."
