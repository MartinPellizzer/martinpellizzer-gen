    "intro": "Anathallis dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's anathema, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescence. The plant typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss, Anathallis dryadum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
