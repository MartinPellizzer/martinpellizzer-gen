    "intro": "Avena pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered oat, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Avena pauciflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
