It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Asplenium durum is well adapted to grow in poor soils and can thrive in crevices or on walls. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
