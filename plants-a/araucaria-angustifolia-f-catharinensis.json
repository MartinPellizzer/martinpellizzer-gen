    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia f. catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a distinctive coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown composed of needle-like leaves. The tree produces large, edible seeds encased in a hard, woody shell, which are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in its native range."
