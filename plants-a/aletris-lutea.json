    "intro": "Aletris lutea, commonly known as yellow false onion, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a valuable groundcover in natural habitats. Aletris lutea is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
