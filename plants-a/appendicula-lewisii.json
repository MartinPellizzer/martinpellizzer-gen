    "intro": "Appendicula lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams and ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. Appendicula lewisii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms."
