    "intro": "Asplenium haleakalense, commonly known as Haleakal\u0101 spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock faces or soil in forested areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
