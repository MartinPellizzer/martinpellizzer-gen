    "intro": "Anacyclus radiatus subsp. valentinus, commonly known as the Valentin's goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with a fibrous root system and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This species is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a short life cycle that allows it to complete its growth and reproduction quickly during favorable periods."
