    "intro": "Abildgaardia angustispicata, commonly known as the narrow-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers with narrow spurs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia angustispicata is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in limestone soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and rocky outcrops, often in areas with low precipitation. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia angustispicata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
