    "intro": "Asclepias longirostra, commonly known as the long-beak milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias longirostra is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its foliage is often covered in a milky sap, which is toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain insect species."
