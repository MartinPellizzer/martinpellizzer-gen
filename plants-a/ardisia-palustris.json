    "intro": "Ardisia palustris, commonly known as swamp beauty, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Ardisia palustris has a compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
