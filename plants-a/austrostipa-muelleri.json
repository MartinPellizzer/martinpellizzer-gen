    "intro": "Austrostipa muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Austrostipa muelleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
