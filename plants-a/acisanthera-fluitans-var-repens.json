    "intro": "Acisanthera fluitans var. repens, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its unique adaptations for life in water. It possesses small, inflated leaves that aid in buoyancy, allowing it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies, though it primarily absorbs nutrients through its roots rather than trapping prey. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters that emerge above the water surface. This variant is often found in ponds, ditches, and other freshwater habitats where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.",
