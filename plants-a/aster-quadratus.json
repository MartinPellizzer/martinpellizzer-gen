    "intro": "Aster quadratus, commonly known as the four-square aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its square-shaped stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster quadratus is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
