    "intro": "Achyrophorus sessiliflorus var. subruncinatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed achyrophorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikes and bloom during the spring or early summer. The variety subruncinatus is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Achyrophorus sessiliflorus.",
