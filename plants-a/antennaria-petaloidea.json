    "intro": "Antennaria petaloidea, commonly known as the showy willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, giving it a delicate, willow-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often appear in pairs along the stems. Antennaria petaloidea thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
