    "intro": "Acaena digitata var. pleodactyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces spiky, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is often found in coastal and lowland areas, contributing to local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena digitata var. pleodactyla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with native vegetation in open and semi-shaded environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena digitata var. pleodactyla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some ecosystems due to its vigorous growth."
