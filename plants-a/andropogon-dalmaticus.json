    "intro": "Andropogon dalmaticus, commonly known as Dalmatian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
