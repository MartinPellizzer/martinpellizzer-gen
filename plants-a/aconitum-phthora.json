It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive appearance that helps in identification.
