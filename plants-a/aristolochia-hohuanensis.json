It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific insect pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can be toxic if ingested."
