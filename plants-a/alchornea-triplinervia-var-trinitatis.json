    "intro": "Alchornea triplinervia var. trinitatis, commonly known as Trinidad beauty or Trinitarian alchornea, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are three-lobed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in the flora of the Lesser Antilles."
