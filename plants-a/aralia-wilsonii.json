    "intro": "Aralia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and is characterized by its compound leaves that are often divided into several narrow segments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in shaded garden environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological landscapes."
