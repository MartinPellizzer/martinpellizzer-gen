    "intro": "Asterocephalus isetensis, commonly known as the Iseten starhead, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its habitat is typically rocky slopes and dry meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterocephalus isetensis is considered a vulnerable species."
