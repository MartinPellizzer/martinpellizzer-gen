    "intro": "Asparagus umbellatus var. scaber, commonly known as the rough asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the Asparagus genus. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy or rough to the touch. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness."
