    "intro": "Antennaria longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, leafy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Antennaria longifolia is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes."
