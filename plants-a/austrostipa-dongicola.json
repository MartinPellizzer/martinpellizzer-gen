    "intro": "Austrostipa dongicola, commonly known as the Dongicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Austrostipa dongicola plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
