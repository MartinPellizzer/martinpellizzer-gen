    "intro": "Adenanthos velutinus, commonly known as the velvet leaf adenanthos, is a small shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy landscapes. Adenanthos velutinus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",
