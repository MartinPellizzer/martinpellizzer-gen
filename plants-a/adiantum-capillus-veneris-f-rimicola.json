    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris f. rimicola, commonly known as the Venus's hair, is a fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble flowing hair.

The plant features finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. The fronds are known for their ability to curl and fold when dry, a trait that contributes to its ornamental appeal.",
