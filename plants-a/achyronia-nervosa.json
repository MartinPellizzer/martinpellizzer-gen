    "intro": "Achyronia nervosa, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic to some animals. Achyronia nervosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.",
