    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. uliginosus, commonly known as the bog bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
