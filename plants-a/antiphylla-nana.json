    "intro": "Antiphylla nana, commonly known as the dwarf antiphylla, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, clustered leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Antiphylla nana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
