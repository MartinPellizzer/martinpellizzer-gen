    "intro": "Aegiphila arborescens var. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and pairs of opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
