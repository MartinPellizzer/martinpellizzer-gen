    "intro": "Aster serrulatus var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy leaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flower heads during the late summer and early fall. Its flowers are typically surrounded by pale green to white involucral bracts, which help protect the florets. This species is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
