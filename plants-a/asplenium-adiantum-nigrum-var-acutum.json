    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. acutum, commonly known as the acute fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, delicate fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, dark green fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
