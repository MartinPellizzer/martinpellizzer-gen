    "intro": "Asplenium congruum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in dense clusters on rock surfaces or tree trunks, forming compact, mat-like structures. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive line. Asplenium congruum is well adapted to humid conditions and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests or rocky crevices."
