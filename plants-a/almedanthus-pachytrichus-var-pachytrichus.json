    "intro": "Almedanthus pachytrichus var. pachytrichus, commonly known as the thick-haired almedanthus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that are covered in dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
