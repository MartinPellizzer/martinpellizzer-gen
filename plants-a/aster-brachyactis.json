    "intro": "Aster brachyactis, commonly known as the short-lived aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster brachyactis thrives in dry, open habitats like meadows and grasslands, and it is adapted to arid environments with its drought-resistant features. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
