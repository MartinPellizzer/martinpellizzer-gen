    "intro": "Astragalus eliasianus, commonly known as Elias's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
