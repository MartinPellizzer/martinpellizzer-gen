It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface that contributes to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
