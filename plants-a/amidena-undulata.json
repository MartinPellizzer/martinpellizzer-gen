    "intro": "Amidena undulata, commonly known as the undulating amidena, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amidena undulata is considered a vulnerable species."
