    "intro": "Angraecum koehleri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
