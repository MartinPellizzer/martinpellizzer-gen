    "intro": "Agrostis stipoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Agrostis stipoides is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental settings."
