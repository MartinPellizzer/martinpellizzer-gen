    "intro": "Avena sativa convar. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its distinct botanical features. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its inflorescence is usually compact, with a single spikelet per node, and the grains are enclosed in a lemma and palea. This variant is often cultivated for its high nutritional value and is used in both agricultural and horticultural settings."
