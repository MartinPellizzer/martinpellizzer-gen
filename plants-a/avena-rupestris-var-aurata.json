    "intro": "Avena rupestris var. aurata, commonly known as the golden oat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are narrow, blue-green, and slightly hairy. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that range in color from white to golden yellow, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This ornamental grass is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
