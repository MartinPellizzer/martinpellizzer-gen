    "intro": "Argythamnia herbacea, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by accessing deep soil moisture. Argythamnia herbacea is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
