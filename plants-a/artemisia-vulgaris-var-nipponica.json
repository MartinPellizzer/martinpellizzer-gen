    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese mugwort, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. This variant is closely related to the common wormwood but exhibits distinct morphological and chemical differences."
