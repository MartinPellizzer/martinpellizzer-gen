    "intro": "Acrostichum schlimense, commonly known as the Schlim's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical landscapes.",
