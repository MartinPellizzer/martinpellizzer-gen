    "intro": "Alchornea pearcei var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf alchornea, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in sandy or rocky soils. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
