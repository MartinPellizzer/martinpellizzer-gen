    "intro": "Astragalus ellipsoideus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, round to elongated pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus ellipsoideus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance in native plant communities."
