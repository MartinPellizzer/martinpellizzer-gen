    "intro": "Airampoa panellana, commonly known as the Panellenan grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Airampoa panellana is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in traditional landscaping due to its ornamental appeal."
