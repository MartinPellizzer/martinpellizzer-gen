    "intro": "Athrixia heterophylla subsp. sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockcress, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
