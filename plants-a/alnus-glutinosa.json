    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa, commonly known as sticky alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in wet or moist soils. The tree produces small, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a sticky, resinous husk, which gives it its common name. It is often found in riparian zones and can play a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
