    "intro": "Athyrium regium, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, arching fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Athyrium regium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
