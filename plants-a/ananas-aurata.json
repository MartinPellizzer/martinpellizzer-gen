    "intro": "Ananas aurata, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in arid environments. Ananas aurata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
