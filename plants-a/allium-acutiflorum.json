    "intro": "Allium acutiflorum, commonly known as the sharpflower garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a useful crop in some regions. Allium acutiflorum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats."
