    "intro": "Astragalus spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus spinosissimus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy and degraded lands."
