It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban landscapes. The plant is known for its ornamental value due to its colorful foliage and unique leaf patterns. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions and lack of widespread cultivation."
