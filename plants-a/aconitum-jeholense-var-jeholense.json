It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed divisions, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
