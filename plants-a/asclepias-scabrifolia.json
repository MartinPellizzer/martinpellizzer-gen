    "intro": "Asclepias scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typical of the milkweed genus. Asclepias scabrifolia is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential sustenance for monarch caterpillars. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
