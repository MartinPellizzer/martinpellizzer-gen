    "intro": "Astragalus creticus subsp. samius, commonly known as the Cretan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
