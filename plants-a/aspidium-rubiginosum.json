    "intro": "Aspidium rubiginosum, commonly known as the rusty back fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a rusty-colored coating. The rusty back fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
