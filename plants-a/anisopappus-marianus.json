    "intro": "Anisopappus marianus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant has a distinctive appearance with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers, which are yellow and occur in clusters, bloom in the spring and are followed by seed pods that resemble small globes. Anisopappus marianus is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
