    "intro": "Allophylus paralleloneurus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are usually narrow and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain two to four seeds. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Allophylus paralleloneurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
