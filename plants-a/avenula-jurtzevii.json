It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subarctic conditions. Its life cycle includes a dormant period during harsh winters, and it reproduces through wind-dispersed seeds. Avenula jurtzevii plays a minor ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife."
