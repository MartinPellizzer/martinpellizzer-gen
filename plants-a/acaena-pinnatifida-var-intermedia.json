    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. intermedia, commonly known as the New Zealand brackenburry, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by persistent, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and forested areas. This species is also notable for its role in traditional M\u0101ori uses and its ecological significance in native habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. intermedia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can thrive in poor soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. This plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely confined to disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins."
