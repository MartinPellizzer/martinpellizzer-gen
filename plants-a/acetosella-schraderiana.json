    "intro": "Acetosella schraderiana, commonly known as Schrader's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour taste, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows. Acetosella schraderiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.",
