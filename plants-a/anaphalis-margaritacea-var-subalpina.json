    "intro": "Anaphalis margaritacea var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a ball of white fluff, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing as a single umbel at the top of the plant. This variety is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
