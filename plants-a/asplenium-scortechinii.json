    "intro": "Asplenium scortechinii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium scortechinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
