    "intro": "Artorima erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Artorima erubescens is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
