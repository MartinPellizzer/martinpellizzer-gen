    "intro": "Antidesma plumbeum, commonly known as the silver antidesma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals."
