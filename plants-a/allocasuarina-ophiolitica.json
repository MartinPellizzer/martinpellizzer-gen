    "intro": "Allocasuarina ophiolitica, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal areas of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its woody seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy or rocky coastal soils. Allocasuarina ophiolitica is well-suited to harsh coastal conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
