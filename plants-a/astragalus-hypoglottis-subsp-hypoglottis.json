    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis subsp. hypoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in prairies and along roadsides. The plant features slender stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive narrow shape. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in drought conditions."
