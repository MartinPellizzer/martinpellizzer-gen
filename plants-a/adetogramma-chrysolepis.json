    "intro": "Adetogramma chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores, which are released into the air for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses.",
