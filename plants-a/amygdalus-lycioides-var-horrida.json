    "intro": "Amygdalus lycioides var. horrida, commonly known as the prickly almond or horrid almond, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, round fruits that are typically covered in a sticky resin. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it is often found in rocky soils. The species is notable for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and aid in its survival in harsh conditions."
