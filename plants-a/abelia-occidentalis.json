It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the eastern and central regions of the country. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions. It has been widely cultivated for its showy clusters of fragrant white to pink flowers. However, it is important to note that it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
