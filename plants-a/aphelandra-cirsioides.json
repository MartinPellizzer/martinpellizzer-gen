    "intro": "Aphelandra cirsioides, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear striking orange-red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Aphelandra cirsioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, showy display."
