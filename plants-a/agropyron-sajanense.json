    "intro": "Agropyron sajanense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures and poor nutrient conditions. Agropyron sajanense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid or degraded landscapes."
