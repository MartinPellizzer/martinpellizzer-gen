It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
