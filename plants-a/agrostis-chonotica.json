    "intro": "Agrostis chonotica, commonly known as the mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Agrostis chonotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
