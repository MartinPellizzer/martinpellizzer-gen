    "intro": "Allium obliquum, commonly known as the Andean garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are often used in traditional Andean cuisine for their pungent, garlicky flavor. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its aromatic compounds that contribute to its culinary and medicinal uses."
