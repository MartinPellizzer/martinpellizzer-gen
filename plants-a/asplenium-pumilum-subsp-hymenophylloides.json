    "intro": "Asplenium pumilum subsp. hymenophylloides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
