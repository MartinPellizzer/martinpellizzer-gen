    "intro": "Asplenium musifolium, commonly known as the musk fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium musifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
