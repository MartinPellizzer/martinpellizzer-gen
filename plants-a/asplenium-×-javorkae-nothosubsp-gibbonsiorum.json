    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 javorkae nothosubsp. gibbonsiorum, commonly known as the Gibbons' shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
