    "intro": "Anthericum hirsutiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered lily, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers with prominent stamens, which are covered in fine, hairy structures. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady habitats. Anthericum hirsutiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodland gardens."
