It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or purple pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and garden cultivation.",
