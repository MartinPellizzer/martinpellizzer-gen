    "intro": "Aconitum swatense var. bracteatum, commonly known as the Swat monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, hooded flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
