    "intro": "Athyrium oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often divided into smaller, pointed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Athyrium oblongum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
