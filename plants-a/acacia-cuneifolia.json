    "intro": "Acacia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are grouped in spherical clusters. Acacia cuneifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia cuneifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants with flowers that typically have five petals and include legumes, which are known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and their ability to thrive in arid environments. Its species is Acacia cuneifolia, a specific type of acacia known for its narrow, leaf-like structures and is native to certain regions of Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cuneifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the south-western region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant typically grows in coastal and inland regions, often in open woodlands or heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Acacia cuneifolia is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cuneifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks where it thrives in full sun. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is often linked to human activity, including land clearing and agricultural expansion."
