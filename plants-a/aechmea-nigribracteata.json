    "intro": "Aechmea nigribracteata, commonly known as the black bract aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking violet to purple inflorescences, with elongated, dark-bracted flowers that are highly ornamental. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea nigribracteata is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor cultivation."
