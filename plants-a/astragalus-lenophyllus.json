    "intro": "Astragalus lenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus lenophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native range."
