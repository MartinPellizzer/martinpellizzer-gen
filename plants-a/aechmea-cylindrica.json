    "intro": "Aechmea cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It produces striking pink or red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and moderate humidity."
