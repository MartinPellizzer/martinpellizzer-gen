    "intro": "Astragalus baalbekensis, commonly known as the Baalbek milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the Levant region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring. Astragalus baalbekensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. Its presence is significant in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and habitat support for local fauna."
