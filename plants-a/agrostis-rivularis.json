    "intro": "Agrostis rivularis, commonly known as rivergrass or water bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically a dull green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Agrostis rivularis is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and saturated soil conditions."
