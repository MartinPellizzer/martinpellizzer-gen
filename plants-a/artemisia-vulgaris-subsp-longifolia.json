    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. longifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with a strong, camphor-like odor due to the presence of essential oils. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family and is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
