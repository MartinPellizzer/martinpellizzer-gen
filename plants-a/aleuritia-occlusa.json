    "intro": "Aleuritia occlusa, commonly known as the Chinese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has alternate, simple leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity."
