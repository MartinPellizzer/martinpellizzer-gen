    "intro": "Aspidium gongylodes, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance, making it easily identifiable."
