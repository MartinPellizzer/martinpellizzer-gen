It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
