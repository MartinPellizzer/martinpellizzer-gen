    "intro": "Astragalus macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus macropetalus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
