    "intro": "Athyrium stramineum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Athyrium stramineum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
