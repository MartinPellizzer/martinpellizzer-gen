    "intro": "Artemisia maritima subsp. vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian mugwort, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It has a creeping growth habit and produces rhizomes, which help it spread and stabilize coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife."
