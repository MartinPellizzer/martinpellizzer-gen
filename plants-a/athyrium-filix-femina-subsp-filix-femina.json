    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. filix-femina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant's elegant appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
