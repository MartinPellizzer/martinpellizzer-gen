It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant communities."
