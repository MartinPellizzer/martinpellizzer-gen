    "intro": "Aspidium glabrum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small smooth shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, dense fronds. It typically features lanceolate to ovate-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or smooth, with a dark green coloration. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is noted for its smaller size compared to the typical form of *Aspidium glabrum*."
