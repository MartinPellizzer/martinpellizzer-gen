    "intro": "Ananas microcephalus var. missionensis, commonly known as the Mission pineapple, is a compact, ornamental pineapple species native to Mexico. It features a small, rounded rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight red or bronze tint. The plant produces a small, edible fruit that is less sweet and more acidic than the common pineapple. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in containers or as a houseplant. This variety is well-suited to warm, sunny environments with well-draining soil."
