    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acelica trimerocalyx is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it often grows as an understory plant. This species is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall throughout the year. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally important plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acelica trimerocalyx was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and unique species with specific ecological requirements. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant's introduction to the dataset highlights its potential role in biodiversity studies and habitat analysis. Its distribution is limited, making it an important subject for conservation efforts. The data provides insights into its geographic range and ecological preferences."
