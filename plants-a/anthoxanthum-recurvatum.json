    "intro": "Anthoxanthum recurvatum, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on lawns and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes and stolons enable it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in turfgrass systems. Anthoxanthum recurvatum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in ecological restoration projects."
