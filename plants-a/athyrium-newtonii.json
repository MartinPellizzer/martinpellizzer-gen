    "intro": "Athyrium newtonii, commonly known as Newton's Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds with a distinctive pattern of light and dark green. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Athyrium newtonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
