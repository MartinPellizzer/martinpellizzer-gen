    "intro": "Androsace rugosa, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are usually borne on short pedicels and are arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Androsace rugosa thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone areas."
