    "intro": "Allium frivaldzkyanum, commonly known as the Frivald's garlic, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 centimeters, featuring basal leaves and a cluster of narrow, grass-like foliage. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in a loose umbel, typical of many Allium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
