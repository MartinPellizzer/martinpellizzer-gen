    "intro": "Aphyllorchis unguiculata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
