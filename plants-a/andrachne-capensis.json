    "intro": "Andrachne capensis, commonly known as the Cape sandthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, red berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and fynbos vegetation. Andrachne capensis is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
