    "intro": "Aristida murina, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, Aristida murina is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
