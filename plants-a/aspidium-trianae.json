    "intro": "Aspidium trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Aspidium trianae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
