    "intro": "Aspidium punctilobum, commonly known as the spotted spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
