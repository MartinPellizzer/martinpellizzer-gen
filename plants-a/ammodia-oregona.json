    "intro": "Ammodia oregona, commonly known as the Oregon sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Ammodia oregona plays a vital role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
