    "intro": "Angraecum lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique and intricate floral structure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with long, slender petals and sepals. Angraecum lujae is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
