    "intro": "Asparagus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by tiny, red berries that are edible but often overlooked. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Asparagus pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
