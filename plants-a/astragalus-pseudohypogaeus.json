    "intro": "Astragalus pseudohypogaeus, commonly known as the false peanut vetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several small, hard seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important plant in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
