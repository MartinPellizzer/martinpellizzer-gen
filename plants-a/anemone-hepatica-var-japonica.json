    "intro": "Anemone hepatica var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
