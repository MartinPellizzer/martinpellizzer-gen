    "intro": "Agrostis thurberiana, commonly known as Thurber's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
