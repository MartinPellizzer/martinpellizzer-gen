    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. recurvum, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear grass-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
