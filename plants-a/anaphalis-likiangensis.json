    "intro": "Anaphalis likiangensis, commonly known as the clouded cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan and Sichuan in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant forms dense, cushion-like rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and botanical collections."
