    "intro": "Apocynum ambigens var. bicolor, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
