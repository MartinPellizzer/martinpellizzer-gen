    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta parvifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant is often associated with riverine and coastal environments where it benefits from high moisture levels. It is also present in parts of southern China and northern Myanmar. Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in cultivated areas near its natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta parvifolia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in partial to full sun. It is commonly found in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized landscapes. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, including the Pacific Northwest and the eastern coastal states. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
