    "intro": "Aligera californica, commonly known as the California aligera, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Aligera californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
