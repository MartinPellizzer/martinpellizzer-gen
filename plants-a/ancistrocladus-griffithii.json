    "intro": "Ancistrocladus griffithii, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is notable for its toxic properties, as its leaves contain various toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical composition."
