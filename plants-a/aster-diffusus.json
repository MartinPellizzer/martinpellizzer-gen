    "intro": "Aster diffusus, commonly known as the woodland aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to lavender, blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Aster diffusus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas."
