    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. microphylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range. The variety is characterized by its small, persistent leaves and distinctive fruiting structures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in some regions of New Zealand. Its rapid spread has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
