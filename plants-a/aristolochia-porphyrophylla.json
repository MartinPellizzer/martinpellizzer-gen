It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep purple veins and its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, reddish covering. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
