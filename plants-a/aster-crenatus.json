    "intro": "Aster crenatus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Aster crenatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
