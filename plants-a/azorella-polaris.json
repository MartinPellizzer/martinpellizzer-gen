    "intro": "Azorella polaris, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a hardy plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the southern tip of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in extreme conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a fibrous root system that anchors it in the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Azorella polaris is adapted to withstand strong winds, low temperatures, and prolonged periods of darkness. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of polar and subpolar ecosystems."
