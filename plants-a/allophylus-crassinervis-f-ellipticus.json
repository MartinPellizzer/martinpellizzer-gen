    "intro": "Allophylus crassinervis f. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic-veined alpine holly, is a variant of the Allophylus crassinervis species. It is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. The plant features elliptical leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which are characteristic of its subspecies. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
