    "intro": "Atriplex pentandra subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically in late summer. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in sandy or saline soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
