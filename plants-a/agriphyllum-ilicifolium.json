    "intro": "Agriphyllum ilicifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Agriphyllum ilicifolium is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
