    "intro": "Arachniodes longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed arachniodes, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and are divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
