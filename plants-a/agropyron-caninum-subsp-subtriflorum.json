It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three to five flower clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in steppes and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential forage in arid regions."
