    "intro": "Asclepias obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweeds. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias obtusata typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
