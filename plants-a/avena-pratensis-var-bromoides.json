    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. bromoides, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
