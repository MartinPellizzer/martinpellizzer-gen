    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astelea sericea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features a rosette of silver-white, silky-hair-covered leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces upright spikes of small, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated for both garden beauty and conservation purposes."
