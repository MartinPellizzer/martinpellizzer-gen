    "intro": "Andropogon hirsutus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. It is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and drought tolerance."
