    "intro": "Abutilon pritchardii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient species within the Malvaceae family.",

This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly found in shrublands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Angola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pritchardii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streams. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded in recent years, raising concerns among land managers and conservationists."
