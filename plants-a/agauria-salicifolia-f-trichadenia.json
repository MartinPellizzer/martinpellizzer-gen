    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia f. trichadenia, commonly known as the hairy-leafed willow-leafed agauria, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
