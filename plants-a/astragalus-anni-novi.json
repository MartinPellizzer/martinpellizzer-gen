    "intro": "Astragalus anni-novi, commonly known as the annual milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus anni-novi is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
