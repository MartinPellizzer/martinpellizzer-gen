    "intro": "Acrostichum podotrichum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
