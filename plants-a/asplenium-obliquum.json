    "intro": "Asplenium obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, clustered sori on the underside. Asplenium obliquum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
