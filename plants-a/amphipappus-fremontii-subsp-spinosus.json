    "intro": "Amphipappus fremontii subsp. spinosus, commonly known as the spiny fremont's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellowish to white composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its spiny pappus, which aids in seed dispersal by wind. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils in desert and steppe habitats. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open areas with minimal vegetation."
