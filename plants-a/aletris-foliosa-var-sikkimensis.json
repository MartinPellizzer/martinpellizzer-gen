    "intro": "Aletris foliosa var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim aletris, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. This variant is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences, typically growing in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. The plant exhibits a compact growth form and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
