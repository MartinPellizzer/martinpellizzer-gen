    "intro": "Asplenium sphenolobium var. usambarense, commonly known as the Usambarensis spleenwort, is a fern species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its lithophytic or epiphytic tendencies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Aspleniaceae family. This variety is notable for its adaptability to humid, tropical climates and its role in forest ecosystems."
