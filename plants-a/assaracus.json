    "intro": "Assaracus, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of approximately 200 species, predominantly found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or gold-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Assaracus species are typically herbaceous, with some growing as shrubs, and they often thrive in moist or wetland environments. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
