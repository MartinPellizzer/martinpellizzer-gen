    "intro": "Ampherephis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and woody stems. Ampherephis species are typically shrubs or small trees, with leaves that are usually opposite and elliptical in shape. Due to their ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, some species of Ampherephis are of interest in horticulture and conservation efforts."
