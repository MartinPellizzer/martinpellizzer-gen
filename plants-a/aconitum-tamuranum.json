    "intro": "Aconitum tamuranum, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
