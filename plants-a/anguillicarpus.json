    "intro": "Anguillicarpus, commonly known as the fish-tail plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble fish tails, hence its common name. Anguillicarpus species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
