    "intro": "Aspidium montevidense f. squamulosa, commonly known as the scalycushion fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds covered in small, scale-like structures. This fern belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a compact growth habit that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's unique morphology, including the presence of squamulose leaves, makes it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
