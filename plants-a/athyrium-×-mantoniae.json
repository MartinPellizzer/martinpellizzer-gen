    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid lace fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservatories for its elegant foliage."
