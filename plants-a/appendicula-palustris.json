    "intro": "Appendicula palustris, commonly known as the marsh appendicula, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize the soil in these sensitive ecosystems. Appendicula palustris plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
