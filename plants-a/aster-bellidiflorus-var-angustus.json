    "intro": "Aster bellidiflorus var. angustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
