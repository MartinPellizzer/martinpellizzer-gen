    "intro": "Aporum cymbulipes, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the large leaves. It produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Due to its size and unique appearance, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems."
