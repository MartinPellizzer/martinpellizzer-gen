    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental features make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry, sunny environments."
