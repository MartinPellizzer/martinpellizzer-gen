    "intro": "Acetosella pearcei, commonly known as the Pearce's sorrel, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Acetosella pearcei thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. It is often found in areas with well-drained soil and is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.",
