    "intro": "Agropyron michnoi, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron michnoi is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with low nutrient content. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
