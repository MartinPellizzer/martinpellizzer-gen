    "intro": "Arthrochilus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Many species of Arthrochilus are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on rocks or tree trunks. Their unique botanical features make them an important component of Australia's diverse flora."
