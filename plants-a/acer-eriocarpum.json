    "intro": "Acer eriocarpum, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, red to orange-red fruits that are clustered in pairs, a distinctive feature of the species. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.",
