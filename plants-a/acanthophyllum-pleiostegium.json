    "intro": "Acanthophyllum pleiostegium, commonly known as the many-stemmed thorned plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, it is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, triangular leaves and produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. It plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems. Its distribution is largely limited to specific habitats within Afghanistan's central and eastern areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum pleiostegium was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils, often growing in dunes and along the edges of salt lakes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems."
