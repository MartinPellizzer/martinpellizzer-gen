    "intro": "Aurantium \u00d7 acre, commonly known as the sour orange, is a hybrid citrus plant resulting from the cross between *Citrus aurantium* and *Citrus sinensis*. It is characterized by its thick, peely skin and a high concentration of citric acid, giving it a tart flavor. The plant typically grows as a small evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often blooming in spring, followed by small, round fruits. The sour orange is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other citrus varieties."
