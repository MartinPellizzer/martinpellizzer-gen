    "intro": "Acorellus pallae, commonly known as the pale acorellus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species.",
