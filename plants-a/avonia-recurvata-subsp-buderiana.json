    "intro": "Avonia recurvata subsp. buderiana, commonly known as the Buder's avonia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions of Europe, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora and ecological adaptations."
