    "intro": "Astragalus confiniorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus confiniorum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine."
