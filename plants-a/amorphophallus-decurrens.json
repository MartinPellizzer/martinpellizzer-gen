    "intro": "Amorphophallus decurrens, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces a striking, spadix inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the \"corpse flower\" in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant has a tuberous root system that allows it to store nutrients and survive in seasonal conditions."
