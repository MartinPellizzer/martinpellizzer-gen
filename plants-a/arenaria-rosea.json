    "intro": "Arenaria rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria rosea is often found in tundra and mountainous environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
