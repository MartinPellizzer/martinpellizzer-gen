    "intro": "Angraecum xylopus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant produces a unique fragrance that attracts its primary pollinator, the star moth (Clepsis perornata). Angraecum xylopus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptation to specific pollination mechanisms."
