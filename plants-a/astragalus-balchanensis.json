    "intro": "Astragalus balchanensis, commonly known as the Balchan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations above 2,000 meters. Astragalus balchanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
