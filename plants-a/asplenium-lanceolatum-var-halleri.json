    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. halleri, commonly known as the Haller's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
