    "intro": "Amorphophallus eichleri, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in diameter. The plant produces a striking, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the \"corpse flower.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas. The plant has a long underground tuber that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
