It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and thrives in humid climates. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. Asplundia luetzelburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
