    "intro": "Alchemilla sandiensis, commonly known as the sand alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Alchemilla sandiensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
