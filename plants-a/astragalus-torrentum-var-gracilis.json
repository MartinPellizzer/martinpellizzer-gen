    "intro": "Astragalus torrentum var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
