    "intro": "Antennaria heteracantha, commonly known as the sticky weed or mouse ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which can adhere to animals and aid in seed dispersal. Antennaria heteracantha is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open habitats."
