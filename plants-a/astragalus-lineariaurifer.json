    "intro": "Astragalus lineariaurifer, commonly known as the goldenline milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus lineariaurifer is often found in rocky slopes, gravelly plains, and sandy soils, making it an important component of xeric ecosystems."
