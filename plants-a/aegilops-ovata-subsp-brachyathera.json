    "intro": "Aegilops ovata subsp. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in wheat improvement and as a source of genetic diversity."
