    "intro": "Arnhemia cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Arnhemia cryptantha is considered a conservation concern."
