    "intro": "Astragalus stevenianus subsp. kochianus, commonly known as the Koch's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
