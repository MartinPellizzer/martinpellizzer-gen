    "intro": "Aleuritia scandinavica, commonly known as the northern elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters and is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows. Aleuritia scandinavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
