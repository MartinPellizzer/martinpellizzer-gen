    "intro": "Astragalus limatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus limatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen."
