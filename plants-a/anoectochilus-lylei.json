    "intro": "Anoectochilus lylei, commonly known as the Lyle's orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anoectochilus lylei is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
