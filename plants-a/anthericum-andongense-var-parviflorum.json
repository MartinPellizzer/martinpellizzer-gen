    "intro": "Anthericum andongense var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, pale green to white flowers clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands, and is native to parts of East Asia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral structure."
