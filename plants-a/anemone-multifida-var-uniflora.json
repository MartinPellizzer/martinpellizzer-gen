It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower with a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
