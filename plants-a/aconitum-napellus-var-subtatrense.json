    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. subtatrense, commonly known as the Subtatar Monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value is notable, though caution is necessary due to its potent toxicity.",
