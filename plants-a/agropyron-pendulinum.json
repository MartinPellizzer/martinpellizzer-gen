    "intro": "Agropyron pendulinum, commonly known as the pendulous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems that often hang over the edges of cliffs and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often bluish-green, adapting to arid and high-altitude environments. Agropyron pendulinum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
