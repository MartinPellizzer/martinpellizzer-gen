    "intro": "Asplenium flabellifolium, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium flabellifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
