    "intro": "Atalanthus microcarpus, commonly known as the little-fruited sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
