    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ankokib is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and northern parts. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in savannas, forests, and along riverbanks. Acacia ankokib plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ankokib was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands in several parts of Africa and Asia. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
