    "intro": "Alchemilla citrina, commonly known as yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright stems that bear small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla citrina is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract beneficial insects."
