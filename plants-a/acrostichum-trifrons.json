    "intro": "Acrostichum trifrons, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens.",
