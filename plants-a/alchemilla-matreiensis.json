    "intro": "Alchemilla matreiensis, commonly known as the Matrei alkanet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alchemilla matreiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in difficult growing conditions."
