It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
