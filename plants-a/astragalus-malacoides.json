It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, facilitating its propagation. Astragalus malacoides is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
