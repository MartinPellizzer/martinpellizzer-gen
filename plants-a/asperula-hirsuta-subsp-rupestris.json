    "intro": "Asperula hirsuta subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to rocky areas in southern Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found on limestone or rocky slopes. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
