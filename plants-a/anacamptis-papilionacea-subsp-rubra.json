    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive red lip, which serves as a visual cue for pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single flowering stem with several flowers. This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
