It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are finely divided and feather-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its intricate foliage."
