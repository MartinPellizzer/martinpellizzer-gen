    "intro": "Asperula scabra var. pubescens, commonly known as the rough woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, wiry stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded woodland areas."
