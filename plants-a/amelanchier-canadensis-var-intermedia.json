    "intro": "Amelanchier canadensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. Its botanical characteristics include compound inflorescences and a preference for well-drained, loamy soils. It is often found in woodland edges and open woods, contributing to local biodiversity."
