    "intro": "Asclepias rivalis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its unique seed pods, which contain numerous small, fluffy seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias rivalis plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its milkweed for laying eggs and feeding larvae."
