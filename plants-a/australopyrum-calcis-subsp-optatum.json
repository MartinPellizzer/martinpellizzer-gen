    "intro": "Australopyrum calcis subsp. optatum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is often extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is well-suited to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
