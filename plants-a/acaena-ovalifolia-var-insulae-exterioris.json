    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. insulae-exterioris, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. insulae-exterioris is primarily native to the Chatham Islands, a remote group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. This plant is endemic to New Zealand, specifically found only on the Chatham Islands. It thrives in the unique ecological conditions of this isolated archipelago. The variety is adapted to the local climate and soil, which are distinct from mainland New Zealand. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. insulae-exterioris was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the flora introduced to the region. This variety is a variant of the common Acaena ovalifolia, which is native to South America. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of New Zealand, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily found in specific habitats such as coastal and lowland environments."
