    "intro": "Anaphalis triplinervis, commonly known as the triple-veined silverweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disc florets, typical of the daisy family. Anaphalis triplinervis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
