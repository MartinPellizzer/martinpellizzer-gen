    "intro": "Annesorhiza altiscapa, commonly known as the tall sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Annesorhiza altiscapa is an important component of coastal vegetation and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
