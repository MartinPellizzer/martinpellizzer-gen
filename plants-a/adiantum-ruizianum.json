    "intro": "Adiantum ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Adiantum genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.",
