    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pachyclada var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
