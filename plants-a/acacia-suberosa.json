    "intro": "Acacia suberosa, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody, twisted stem and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Acacia suberosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia suberosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is well adapted to the region's climate, which includes hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia suberosa is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia suberosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to warm climate, where it can thrive in full sun. It is commonly found in regions with low to moderate rainfall, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
