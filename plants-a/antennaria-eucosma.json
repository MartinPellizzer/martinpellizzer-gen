    "intro": "Antennaria eucosma, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various invertebrates."
