    "intro": "Allium virgunculae var. yakushimense, commonly known as the Yakushimense leek, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Japanese island of Yakushima. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
