    "intro": "Astragalus orbicularifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
