It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with fringed margins. The plant produces upright, cylindrical flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It blooms in the spring and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Allium ciliare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
