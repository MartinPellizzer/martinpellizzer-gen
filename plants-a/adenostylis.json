These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their tall, grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. Adenostylis species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. They are often found in coastal or sandy habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
