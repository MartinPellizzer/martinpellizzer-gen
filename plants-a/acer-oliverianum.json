    "intro": "Acer oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.",
