    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spiny, woody fruits known as achenes. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subserrata is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. The species is known for its distinctive spiny structures and small, clustered flowers. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subserrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its persistent seeds and can form dense stands. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact."
