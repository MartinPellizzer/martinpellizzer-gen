    "intro": "Alisma taeniifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Alisma taeniifolium is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
