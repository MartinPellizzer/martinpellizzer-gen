    "intro": "Aegilops comosa f. major, commonly known as the hairy wild barley, is a diploid grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups, with lemmas that are rough and bristly. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to cultivated barley species."
