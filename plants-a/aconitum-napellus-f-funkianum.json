    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. funkianum, commonly known as the Funk's monkshood, is a cultivar of the monkshood plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a coarse texture, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
