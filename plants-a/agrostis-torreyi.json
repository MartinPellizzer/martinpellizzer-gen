    "intro": "Agrostis torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forested areas. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis torreyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
