    "intro": "Aporum koeteianum, commonly known as the Koetei aporum, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
