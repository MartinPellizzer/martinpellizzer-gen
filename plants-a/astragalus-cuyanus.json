    "intro": "Astragalus cuyanus, commonly known as the Cuyani milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Astragalus cuyanus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for livestock and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
