    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia hanceana is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan. It thrives in mountainous regions with a temperate climate and is commonly found in forests and along streams. This plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in humid, subtropical environments. It is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. Abelia hanceana is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia hanceana was mainly introduced to gardens and landscapes in the United States and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated for its compact size and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is often used in borders, containers, and as a hedge because of its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. It has become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, its spread outside of cultivated areas requires careful management."
