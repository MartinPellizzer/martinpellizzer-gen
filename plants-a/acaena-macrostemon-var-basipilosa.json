This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon var. basipilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its competitive growth habits. Despite its introduced status, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native wildlife."
