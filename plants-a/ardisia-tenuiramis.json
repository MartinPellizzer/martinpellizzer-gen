It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Ardisia tenuiramis thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
