    "intro": "Angorkis eburnea, commonly known as the ivory wood plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale-colored bark that resembles ivory, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angorkis eburnea is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers and conservationists."
