    "intro": "Arceuthobium cryptopodum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host, typically members of the Ericaceae family, for nutrients and water. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are launched into the air upon disturbance. It is found in moist, acidic soils across the northern hemisphere. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships."
