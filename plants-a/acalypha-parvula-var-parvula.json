It thrives in the unique ecological conditions of this region. The species is adapted to the island's climate and soil composition. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem of the Gal\u00e1pagos.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula var. parvula was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in the southeastern region, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in garden landscapes and as a ground cover. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, leading to management efforts to control its spread. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance."
