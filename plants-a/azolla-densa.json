    "intro": "Azolla densa, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the Azollaceae family. It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, contributing to water oxygenation through photosynthesis. The plant has small, overlapping fronds that are rich in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, enhancing its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native environments. Azolla densa is also used in traditional agriculture as a biofertilizer due to its high nutrient content."
