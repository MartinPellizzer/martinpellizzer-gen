    "intro": "Ambrosia pumila, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, green leaves and yellow-green flowers that appear in the late summer and early fall. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen for many people. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in fields. Ambrosia pumila is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native plants and contributing to air pollution through its pollen."
