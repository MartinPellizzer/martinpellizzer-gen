    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema laeta is primarily native to South America, particularly in Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often encountered in moist, shaded areas such as undergrowth in dense forests. Abarema laeta is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema laeta was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant has been reported in several countries across South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and seed dispersal through livestock. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
