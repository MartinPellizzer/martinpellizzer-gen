    "intro": "Aristida vestita var. pseudohystrix, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The variety pseudohystrix is distinguished by its more pronounced silver hairs and slightly different inflorescence structure compared to the typical form."
