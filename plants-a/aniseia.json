    "intro": "Aniseia, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in dense clusters. The plant is native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Aniseia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and in swampy habitats."
