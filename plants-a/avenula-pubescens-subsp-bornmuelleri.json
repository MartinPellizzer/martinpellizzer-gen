It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
