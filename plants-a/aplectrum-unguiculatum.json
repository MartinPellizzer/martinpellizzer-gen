    "intro": "Aplectrum unguiculatum, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, ghostly appearance. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in shaded, forested areas where it thrives on mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has no true leaves or stems, instead relying on its root system to absorb nutrients from the fungi. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its specialized relationship with fungi and its elusive nature, it is considered a rare and delicate species in many regions."
