    "intro": "Amyema conspicua subsp. obscurinervis, commonly known as the dark-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more prominent leaf veins compared to other varieties of Amyema."
