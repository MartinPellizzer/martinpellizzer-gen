    "intro": "Avena fatua subsp. cultiformis, commonly known as the cultivated oat, is a wild oat species that exhibits characteristics intermediate between cultivated oats and other wild oat species. It is a perennial grass with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically shorter and more compact than those of other Avena species. It is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both agricultural and ecological studies."
