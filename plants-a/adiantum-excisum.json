    "intro": "Adiantum excisum, commonly known as the cut fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a finely cut appearance, giving it a lacy texture. Adiantum excisum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
