    "intro": "Astragalus vexilliflexus var. nubilus, commonly known as the clouded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
