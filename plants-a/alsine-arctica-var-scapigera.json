    "intro": "Alsine arctica var. scapigera, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environments."
