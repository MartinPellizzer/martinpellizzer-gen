    "intro": "Aeranthes arachnites var. balfourii, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
