    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. pubigera, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
