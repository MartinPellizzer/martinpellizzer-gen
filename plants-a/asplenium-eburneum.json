    "intro": "Asplenium eburneum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
