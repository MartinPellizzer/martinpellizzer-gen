    "intro": "Anacamptis morio subsp. champagneuxii, commonly known as the Champagne Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive golden-green lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowering period occurs between May and July, during which it produces a single, elegant spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
