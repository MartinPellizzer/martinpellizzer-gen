    "intro": "Adenopodia polystachya, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright, branched shoots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Adenopodia polystachya has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a primitive vascular plant. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, contributing to its role in early plant colonization of land."
