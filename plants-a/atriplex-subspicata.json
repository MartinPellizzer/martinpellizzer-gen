    "intro": "Atriplex subspicata, commonly known as prickly cholla, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Atriplex subspicata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
