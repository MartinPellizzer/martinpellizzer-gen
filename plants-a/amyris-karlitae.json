    "intro": "Amyris karlitae, commonly known as the karlitae sandalwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is similar to sandalwood in scent and texture. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange or red fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amyris karlitae is considered a vulnerable species."
