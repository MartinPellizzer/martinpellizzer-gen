    "intro": "Acalypha canescens, commonly known as whiteleaf copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Acalypha canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha canescens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the island of Madagascar. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. It is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha canescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by human activity, such as through trade or horticultural introduction. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed habitats throughout the region. It is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
