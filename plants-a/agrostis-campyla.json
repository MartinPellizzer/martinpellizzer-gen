    "intro": "Agrostis campyla, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in panicles, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Agrostis campyla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
