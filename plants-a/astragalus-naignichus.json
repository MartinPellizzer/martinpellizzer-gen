It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, and it produces small, hard pods that contain seeds. Astragalus naignichus is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric environments."
