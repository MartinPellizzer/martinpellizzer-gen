It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, adding subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
