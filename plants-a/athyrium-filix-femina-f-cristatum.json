    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. cristatum, commonly known as the cristate lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its unique, flattened fronds that give it a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. This fern is native to the temperate regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that create a delicate, lace-like texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. The plant is known for its graceful appearance and is a popular choice for shaded garden borders and woodland settings."
