    "intro": "Anerincleistus pauciflorus var. brevipedunculus, commonly known as the short-stemmed starflower, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are short and sturdy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
