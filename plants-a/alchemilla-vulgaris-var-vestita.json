It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
