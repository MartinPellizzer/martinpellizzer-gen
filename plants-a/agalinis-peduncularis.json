It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Agalinis peduncularis plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
