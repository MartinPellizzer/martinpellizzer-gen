    "intro": "Assonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly assonia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly succulent texture. Assonia tomentosa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation."
