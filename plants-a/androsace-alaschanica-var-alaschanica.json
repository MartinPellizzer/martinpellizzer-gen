    "intro": "Androsace alaschanica var. alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
