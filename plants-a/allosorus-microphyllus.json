    "intro": "Allosorus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf allosorus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shady environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
