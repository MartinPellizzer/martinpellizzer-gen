    "intro": "Aster sibiricus subsp. pygmaeus, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
