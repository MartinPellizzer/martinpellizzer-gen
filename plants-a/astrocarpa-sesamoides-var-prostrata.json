    "intro": "Astrocarpa sesamoides var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sesamoid astrocarpa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
