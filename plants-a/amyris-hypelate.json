    "intro": "Amyris hypelate, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Amyris hypelate is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical climates. Its aromatic properties have made it historically valued for use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
