It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is often included in restoration projects aimed at preserving native wetland vegetation."
