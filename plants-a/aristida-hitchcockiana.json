    "intro": "Aristida hitchcockiana, commonly known as Hitchcock's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender stems, and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hitchcock's grass is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
