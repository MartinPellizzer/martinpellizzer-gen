    "intro": "Alyssum ephesium, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist heat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum ephesium is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and hoverflies."
