    "intro": "Acrostichum viscosum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a variety of the slippery fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into multiple segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
