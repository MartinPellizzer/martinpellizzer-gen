    "intro": "Arenaria yunnanensis var. trichophora, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
