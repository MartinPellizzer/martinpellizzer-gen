    "intro": "Astragalus brotherusii, commonly known as the Desert Milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system for water storage. Astragalus brotherusii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
