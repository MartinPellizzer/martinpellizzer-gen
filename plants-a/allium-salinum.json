It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slight bluish tint. Allium salinum is valued for its culinary uses, with bulbs that can be eaten raw or cooked."
