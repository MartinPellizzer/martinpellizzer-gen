It features creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
