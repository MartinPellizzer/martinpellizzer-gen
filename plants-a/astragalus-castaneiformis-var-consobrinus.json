    "intro": "Astragalus castaneiformis var. consobrinus, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. The variety consobrinus is distinguished by its reddish stems and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
