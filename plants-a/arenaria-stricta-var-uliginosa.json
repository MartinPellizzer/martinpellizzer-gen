    "intro": "Arenaria stricta var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments. It typically grows in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats where the soil remains consistently saturated. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. It has a low-growing habit with stems that often lie close to the ground. This variety is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
