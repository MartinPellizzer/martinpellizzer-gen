    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. setifrons, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide, with a distinctive tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its fine texture and dense growth make it a valuable component of ecological and horticultural landscapes."
