    "intro": "Astracantha crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined aster, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, purple to pink flower heads that resemble daisies, with ray florets surrounding a central disc. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have prominent, parallel veins, giving it its scientific name. Astracantha crassinervia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
