    "intro": "Asclepias laniflora, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is milky and somewhat toxic. Asclepias laniflora plays an important ecological role, particularly as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
