    "intro": "Avena fatua f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its reduced hair coverage. It is a grassy plant native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils such as fields and roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This form is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth and potential for seed dispersal."
