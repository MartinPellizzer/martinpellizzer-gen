It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow spore cases, which contrast with the typical green spores of the species. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The golden spores are a notable botanical feature, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
