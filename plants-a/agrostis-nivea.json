    "intro": "Agrostis nivea, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Agrostis nivea produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
