    "intro": "Acer truncatum var. barbinerve, commonly known as the barbed-veined maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that have prominent, barbed veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the autumn. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal.",
