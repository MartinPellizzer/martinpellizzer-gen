    "intro": "Ancylostemon, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. Ancylostemon species are adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow them to survive in sandy or rocky soils. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can be cultivated as ornamental plants in dry gardens."
