    "intro": "Aloe obliqua, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a whitish powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe obliqua is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface."
