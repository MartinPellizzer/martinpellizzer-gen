It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its bark and leaves contain potent cardiac glycosides. These compounds have historically been used by indigenous peoples to poison arrows. Despite its harmful effects, the plant plays a significant role in traditional medicine and ecological systems.",
