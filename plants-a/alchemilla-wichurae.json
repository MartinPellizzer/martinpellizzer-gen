    "intro": "Alchemilla wichurae, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Alchemilla wichurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
