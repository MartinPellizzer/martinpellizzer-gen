    "intro": "Acacia microcybe, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, dark green leaves that are narrow and oval in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in globular heads, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Acacia microcybe is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy soils across arid and semi-arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia microcybe is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the tropical and sub-tropical climates of Queensland. Acacia microcybe plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used in traditional land management practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia microcybe was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a forage plant in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, potentially displacing native vegetation. Its introduction has had both beneficial and problematic ecological impacts depending on the environment."
