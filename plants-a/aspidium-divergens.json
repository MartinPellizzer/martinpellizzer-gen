    "intro": "Aspidium divergens, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
