It typically features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous slender stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid, high-altitude environments. Alsine verna var. alpina is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
