    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, including the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, such as rocky soils, grasslands, and forest margins. It is often associated with the subantarctic and temperate climates of New Zealand. Acaena sanguisorbae plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in disturbed areas and along forest edges. The plant spreads primarily through its persistent, spiny fruits which are dispersed by animals and water. Its establishment has led to competition with native species, raising concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are underway to control its spread in sensitive habitats."
