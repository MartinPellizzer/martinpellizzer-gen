    "intro": "Acer mandshuricum, commonly known as the Manchurian maple, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
