    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. josifovicii is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including parts of southeastern Europe. It is found in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. This variety thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas and along river valleys. It is a smaller variant of the common maple, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. josifovicii was mainly introduced to Europe as a horticultural curiosity due to its unique leaf morphology and ornamental value. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and gained popularity among botanists and gardeners for its distinctive foliage. The plant is now cultivated in various regions across Europe, particularly in botanical gardens and private collections. Its introduction has led to limited naturalization in some areas, though it remains primarily a garden species. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely distributed in the wild compared to other maple species."
