    "intro": "Aspalathus katbergensis, commonly known as the Katberg bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is a key component of the fynbos vegetation. Aspalathus katbergensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
