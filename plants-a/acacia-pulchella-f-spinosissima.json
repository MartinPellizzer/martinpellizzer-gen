    "intro": "Acacia pulchella f. spinosissima, commonly known as the spinous acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in arid environments. Its adaptations make it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella f. spinosissima is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales and Queensland. This variant is commonly found in dry, open habitats like woodlands, heathlands, and rocky outcrops. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought and is often seen growing in coastal and inland regions. Its distinctive spiny foliage and yellow flowers make it a notable species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella f. spinosissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, contributing to its spread. Management efforts are ongoing to control its impact on local ecosystems."
