    "intro": "Astartea onycis, commonly known as the golden starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by showy, white bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Astartea onycis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
