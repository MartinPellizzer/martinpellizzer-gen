    "intro": "Asplenium iezimaense, commonly known as the Iezima fern, is a species of fern native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Asplenium iezimaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
