    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is frequently used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
