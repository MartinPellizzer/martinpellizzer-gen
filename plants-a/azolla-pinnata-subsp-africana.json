    "intro": "Azolla pinnata subsp. africana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its small, feather-like fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater bodies and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to suppress aquatic weeds, it is sometimes used in phytoremediation and as a biofertilizer."
