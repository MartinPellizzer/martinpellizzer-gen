    "intro": "Aerides williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Aerides williamsii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
