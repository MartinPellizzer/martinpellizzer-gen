    "intro": "Alchemilla penicillata, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Alchemilla penicillata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
