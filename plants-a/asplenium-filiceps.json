    "intro": "Asplenium filiceps, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on humidity rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, moss-like layer. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the spores are mature. Asplenium filiceps is a hardy species that is often found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide."
