    "intro": "Astragalus laxmannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus laxmannii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
