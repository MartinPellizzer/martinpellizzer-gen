    "intro": "Agrostemma dioicum, commonly known as the common flax or wild flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous husk, and the plant is known for its historical use in textile production. However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
