The botanical features include a thick, fuzzy skin and a fleshy, juicy interior with a sweet, sometimes aromatic flavor. It is typically smaller than standard peaches and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. The plant is deciduous, producing flowers in spring followed by fruit development throughout the summer."
