    "intro": "Athyrium pectinatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain the spores. Athyrium pectinatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
