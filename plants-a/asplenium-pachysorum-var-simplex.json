    "intro": "Asplenium pachysorum var. simplex, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a distinctive, delicate, and feathery appearance, which are typically dark green and glossy. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread through underground stems and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
