    "intro": "Astragalus substenoceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus substenoceras is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
