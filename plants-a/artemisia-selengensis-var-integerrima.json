    "intro": "Artemisia selengensis var. integerrima, commonly known as Selengian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. It has a strong, camphor-like scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
