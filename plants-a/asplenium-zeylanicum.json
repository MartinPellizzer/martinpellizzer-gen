    "intro": "Asplenium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori. Asplenium zeylanicum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
