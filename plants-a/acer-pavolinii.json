    "intro": "Acer pavolinii, commonly known as the Pavolini maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking red or orange coloration in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, Acer pavolinii is valued for both its aesthetic and ecological contributions.",
