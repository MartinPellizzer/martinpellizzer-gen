    "intro": "Agropyron antiquum, commonly known as ancient wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in cold, dry climates with well-drained soils. Agropyron antiquum is valued for its hardiness and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
