    "intro": "Aspidium viviparum subsp. rhizophorum, commonly known as the root fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique rhizome structure. It is a fern that produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups called sori. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, serving as a storage organ and aiding in its survival in various habitats. The species is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where sporangia are produced directly on the rhizome rather than on specialized leaves."
