    "intro": "Axonotechium, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Axonotechium species typically grow in dense mats or clusters, forming low-growing, ground-covering vegetation. They reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and provide valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants."
