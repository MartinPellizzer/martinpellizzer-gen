    "intro": "Astragalus johannis, commonly known as John's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Astragalus johannis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
