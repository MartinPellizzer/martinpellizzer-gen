    "intro": "Artrolobium durum, commonly known as the hardy globular cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, spherical stem that is typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
