    "intro": "Acanthocarpus, commonly known as the thorned carpus, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and distinctive, thorn-like structures on their stems and pods. Acanthocarpus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The genus includes several species that are used for forage, erosion control, and traditional medicine. Their unique botanical features make them important in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
