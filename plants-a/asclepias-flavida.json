    "intro": "Asclepias flavida, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias flavida is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for its larvae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
