    "intro": "Alectorolophus aristatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
