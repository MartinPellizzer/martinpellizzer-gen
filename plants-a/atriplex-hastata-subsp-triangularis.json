    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed bracts. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
