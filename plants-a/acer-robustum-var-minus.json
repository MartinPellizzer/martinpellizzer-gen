    "intro": "Acer robustum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact variant of the robust maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China and Korea. This plant typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",
