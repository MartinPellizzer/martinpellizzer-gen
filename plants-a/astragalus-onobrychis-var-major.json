    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. major, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to reddish pea-like flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Sainfoin has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is also used in forage and as a traditional medicinal plant in some cultures."
