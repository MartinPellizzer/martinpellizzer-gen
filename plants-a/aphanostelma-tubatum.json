    "intro": "Aphanostelma tubatum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together perform photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its structure provides protection against desiccation and extreme temperatures. Aphanostelma tubatum is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops."
