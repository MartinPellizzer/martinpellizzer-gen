    "intro": "Acmispon grandiflorus, commonly known as the largeflower burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Acmispon grandiflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
