The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Agrostis frondosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
