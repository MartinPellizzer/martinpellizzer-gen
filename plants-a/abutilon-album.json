    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon album is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is also found in parts of India and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its natural range extends into some Pacific island nations as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon album was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
