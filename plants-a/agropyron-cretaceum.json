    "intro": "Agropyron cretaceum, commonly known as the cretaceous grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron cretaceum is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in dryland ecosystems."
