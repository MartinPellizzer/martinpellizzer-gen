    "intro": "Aristolochia eurystoma var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with other members of the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
