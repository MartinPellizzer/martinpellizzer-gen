    "intro": "Asplenium woodwardioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
