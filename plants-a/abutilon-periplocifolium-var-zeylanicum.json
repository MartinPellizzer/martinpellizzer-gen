It is valued for its attractive, velvety foliage and its potential medicinal properties. The plant has been cultivated in various regions with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its invasive potential. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
