    "intro": "Aspidonepsis reenensis, commonly known as the Reunion water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Aspidonepsis reenensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
