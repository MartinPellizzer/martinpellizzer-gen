    "intro": "Arabidopsis tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thale cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small white or yellow flowers. It is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in research, though less commonly than its relative."
