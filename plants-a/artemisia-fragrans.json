    "intro": "Artemisia fragrans, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of absinthe."
