    "intro": "Aeonium canariense var. palmense, commonly known as the Canary Island tree aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, tree-like trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and it produces rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves at the top. The plant is characterized by its ability to form a trunk over time, making it unique among aeonium species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance in arid or semi-arid climates."
