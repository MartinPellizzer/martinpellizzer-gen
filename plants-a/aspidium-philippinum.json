    "intro": "Aspidium philippinum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while its fronds float on the water's surface. Aspidium philippinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
