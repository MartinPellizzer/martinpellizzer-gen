    "intro": "Astragalus coadunatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus coadunatus is often found in open grasslands and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
