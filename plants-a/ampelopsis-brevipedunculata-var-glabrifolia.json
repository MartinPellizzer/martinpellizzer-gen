    "intro": "Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
