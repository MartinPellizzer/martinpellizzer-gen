    "intro": "Atractylis arbuscula subsp. arbuscula, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a dense mat of slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, forming a cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to survive in dry, sandy environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean and semi-arid regions."
