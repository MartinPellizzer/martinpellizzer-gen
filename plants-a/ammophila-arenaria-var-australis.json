    "intro": "Ammophila arenaria var. australis, commonly known as the Australian beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in stabilizing sandy dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. This species plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and maintaining dune ecosystems."
