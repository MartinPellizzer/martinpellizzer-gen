    "intro": "Acacia veracruzensis, commonly known as the Veracruz acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often found in limestone soils. Acacia veracruzensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia veracruzensis is primarily native to Mexico and Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with low rainfall. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia veracruzensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It is commonly found in degraded areas and has been used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original range, prompting further ecological studies to assess its impact."
