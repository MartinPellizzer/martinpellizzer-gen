    "intro": "Aeschynomene cristata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant ecological and agronomic concern in its native range."
