    "intro": "Asclepias parviflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkweed, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. This variety is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
