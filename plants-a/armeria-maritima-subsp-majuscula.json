    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. majuscula, commonly known as the showy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage consists of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
