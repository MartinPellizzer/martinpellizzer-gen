    "intro": "Aspidium opacum, commonly known as the obscure water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Aspidium opacum is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds."
