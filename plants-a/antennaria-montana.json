    "intro": "Antennaria montana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Antennaria montana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for early pollinators."
