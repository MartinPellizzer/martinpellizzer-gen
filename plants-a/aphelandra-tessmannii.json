    "intro": "Aphelandra tessmannii, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a striking member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, elongated leaves that often display a mix of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the true flowers. Aphelandra tessmannii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
