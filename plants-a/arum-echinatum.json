    "intro": "Arum echinatum, commonly known as the spiny arum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-shaped inflorescence surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
