It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and digestive properties. Anisophyllea exellii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks."
