    "intro": "Aspidium crenatum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into small, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Aspidium crenatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in damp areas."
