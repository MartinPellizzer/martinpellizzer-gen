    "intro": "Artemisia pontica var. calyculata, commonly known as the Turkish tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its strong, camphor-like fragrance, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
