    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. albella, commonly known as the white-tailed spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. The plant features a slender, hairy stem and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
