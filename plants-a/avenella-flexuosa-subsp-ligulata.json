It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
