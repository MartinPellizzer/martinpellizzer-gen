The plant features basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Alchemilla sprucei thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
