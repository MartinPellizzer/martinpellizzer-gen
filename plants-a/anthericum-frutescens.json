    "intro": "Anthericum frutescens, commonly known as the purple ram's horn, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. Anthericum frutescens is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
