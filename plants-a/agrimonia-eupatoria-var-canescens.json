    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. canescens, commonly known as the grey agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in a fine, greyish down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Agrimony is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been historically used in herbal medicine."
