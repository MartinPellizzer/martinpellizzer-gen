    "intro": "Alsophila geluensis, commonly known as the Geluenski's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth pattern with a central trunk that produces new fronds at the top, creating a layered appearance. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Alsophila geluensis is often found in humid forests, where it thrives in the understory with high humidity and indirect sunlight."
