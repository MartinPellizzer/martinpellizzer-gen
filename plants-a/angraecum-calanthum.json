    "intro": "Angraecum calanthum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with dark purple markings. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears several blooms, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Angraecum calanthum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
