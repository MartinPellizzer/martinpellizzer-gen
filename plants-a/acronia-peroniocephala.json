    "intro": "Acronia peroniocephala, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens along the coastline.",
