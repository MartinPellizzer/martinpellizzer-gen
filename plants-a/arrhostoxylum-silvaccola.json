    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum silvaccola, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Arrhostoxylum silvaccola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
