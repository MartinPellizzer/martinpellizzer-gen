    "intro": "Acantholimon amoenum, commonly known as the Armenian thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon amoenum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including cold temperatures and limited rainfall. Acantholimon amoenum is an important component of the local flora and is typically found in alpine and subalpine zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon amoenum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, including slopes and disturbed sites. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. Its introduction is associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as land development and road construction. Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in some regions where it may compete with native vegetation."
