    "intro": "Androsace russellii, commonly known as Russell's alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
