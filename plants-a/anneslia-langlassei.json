    "intro": "Anneslia langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's anneslia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with five lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
