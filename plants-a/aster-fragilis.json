    "intro": "Aster fragilis, commonly known as the brittle aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features delicate, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. Aster fragilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
