    "intro": "Amyema hexantha, commonly known as the slender lichen orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white or pale pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, narrow, tubular shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in subtropical regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
