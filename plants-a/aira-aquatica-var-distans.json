    "intro": "Aira aquatica var. distans, commonly known as the water airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some cultures."
