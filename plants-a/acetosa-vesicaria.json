    "intro": "Acetosa vesicaria, commonly known as the blistered chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular dots. The plant produces tiny, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves contain compounds that can cause skin irritation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as \"blistering.\" Acetosa vesicaria thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.",
