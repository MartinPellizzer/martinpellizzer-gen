    "intro": "Anthoxanthum japonicum subsp. luzoniense, commonly known as Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
