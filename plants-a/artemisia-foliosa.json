    "intro": "Artemisia foliosa, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its aromatic leaves have been used traditionally by Native American tribes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
