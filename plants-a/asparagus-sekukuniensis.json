    "intro": "Asparagus sekukuniensis, commonly known as the Sekukuni asparagus, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
