    "intro": "Aulomyrcia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Aulomyrcia ehrenbergiana is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
