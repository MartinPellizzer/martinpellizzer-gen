    "intro": "Acnida cannabina var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemp nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to cannabis, it is sometimes mistaken for the marijuana plant, though it contains negligible levels of THC.",
