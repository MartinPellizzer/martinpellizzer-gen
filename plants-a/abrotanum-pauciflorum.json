    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum pauciflorum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its native range extends into parts of northern Mexico, including the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum pauciflorum was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in certain regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth habit. The plant has been reported in several states in the southeastern United States. It is considered invasive in some areas because of its ability to outcompete native vegetation. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its introduced range."
