    "intro": "Artemisia altissima, commonly known as giant wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-green, aromatic foliage and tall, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a rough, fuzzy texture, and emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Artemisia altissima is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
