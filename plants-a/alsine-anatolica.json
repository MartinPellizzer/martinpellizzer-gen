    "intro": "Alsine anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The seeds are small and have a distinctive ribbed structure, which aids in wind dispersal."
