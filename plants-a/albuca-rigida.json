    "intro": "Albuca rigida, commonly known as the rigid albuca, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Albuca rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in gardens."
