    "intro": "Agapanthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging agapanthus, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flower heads that dangle from long, slender stems, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are evergreen and form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Agapanthus pendulus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
