    "intro": "Asplenium knudsenii, commonly known as the Knudsen's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bark of trees. Asplenium knudsenii is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
