It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often curved and covered in short, bristly hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
