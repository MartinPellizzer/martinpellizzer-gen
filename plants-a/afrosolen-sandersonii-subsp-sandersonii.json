    "intro": "Afrosolen sandersonii subsp. sandersonii, commonly known as the Sanderson's afrosolen, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
