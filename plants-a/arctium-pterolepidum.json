    "intro": "Arctium pterolepidum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a thick, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the prickly, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
