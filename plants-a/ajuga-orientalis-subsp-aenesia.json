    "intro": "Ajuga orientalis subsp. aenesia, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread vigorously and suppress weeds in woodland or rock garden environments."
