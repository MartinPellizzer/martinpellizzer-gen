It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
