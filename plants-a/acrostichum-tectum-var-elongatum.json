    "intro": "Acrostichum tectum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated hound's tongue, is a variant of the hound's tongue fern. It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, elongated appearance.",
