    "intro": "Andromeda speciosa var. glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which turns a vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and natural landscapes."
