    "intro": "Axinaea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered axinaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple throat. It typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky outcrops, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
