    "intro": "Apocynum densiflorum, commonly known as the thickflower dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
