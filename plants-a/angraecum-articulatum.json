    "intro": "Angraecum articulatum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid or the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth, for reproduction. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
