    "intro": "Aspalathus millefolia, commonly known as African green tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce a caffeine-free herbal tea prized for its earthy and slightly sweet flavor. Aspalathus millefolia is also valued for its antioxidant properties and traditional medicinal uses."
