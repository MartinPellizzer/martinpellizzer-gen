    "intro": "Albuca crispa, commonly known as the Zulu lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Albuca crispa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
