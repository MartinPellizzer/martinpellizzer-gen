    "intro": "Artemisia dubia f. grata, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a distinctive, minty scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ornamental value in dry gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds with historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of artemisinin, a key component in antimalarial drugs."
