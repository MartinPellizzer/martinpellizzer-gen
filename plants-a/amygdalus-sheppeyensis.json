    "intro": "Amygdalus sheppeyensis, commonly known as Sheppey almond, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the UK. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal habitats, characterized by its small, pale green leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts that are encased in a thick, woody shell. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is one of the rarest almond species in the world. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
