    "intro": "Asplenium riswanii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium riswanii is often found in crevices of limestone or basalt rocks, where it forms dense colonies. Its ability to colonize such harsh habitats makes it an important component of rock-associated ecosystems."
