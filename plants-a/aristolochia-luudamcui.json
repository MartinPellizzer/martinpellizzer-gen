    "intro": "Aristolochia luudamcui, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
