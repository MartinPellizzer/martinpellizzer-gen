    "intro": "Arachis diogoi f. subglabrata, commonly known as the smooth peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its reduced pubescence on the stem and leaves. This subspecies belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. It produces underground pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species, but with a more compact growth habit. The plant is typically herbaceous, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in agricultural and genetic studies due to its potential for improved yield and adaptability."
