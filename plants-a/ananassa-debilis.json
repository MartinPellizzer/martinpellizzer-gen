    "intro": "Ananassa debilis, commonly known as the weak pineapple, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries resembling tiny pineapples. Ananassa debilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
