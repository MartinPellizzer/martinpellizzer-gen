    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana var. bornmuelleriana is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of northern Georgia, southern Russia, and eastern Turkey. This variety is found in mountainous areas with a humid climate and well-drained soils. It typically grows in forested regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters and warm, moist summers. It is often part of mixed coniferous forests in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana var. bornmuelleriana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide the specific conditions of cool summers and cold, moist winters it requires. It is particularly suited for areas with well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, including its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. However, its introduction outside its native range requires careful consideration due to potential ecological impacts."
