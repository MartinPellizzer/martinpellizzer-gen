    "intro": "Ampelocissus sphaerophylla, commonly known as the African moon vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Ampelocissus sphaerophylla is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
