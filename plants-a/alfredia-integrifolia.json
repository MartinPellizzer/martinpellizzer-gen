It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with woody stems and a compact form. Alfredia integrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions."
