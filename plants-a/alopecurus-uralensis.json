    "intro": "Alopecurus uralensis, commonly known as Siberian mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Alopecurus uralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
