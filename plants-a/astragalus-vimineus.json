    "intro": "Astragalus vimineus, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus vimineus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
