    "intro": "Alisma praecox, commonly known as early marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is typically found in wetland environments such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like. Alisma praecox is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
