    "intro": "Ampelocissus martini, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a woody vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trailing habit and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Ampelocissus martini is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb structures."
