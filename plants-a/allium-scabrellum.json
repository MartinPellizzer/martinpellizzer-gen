    "intro": "Allium scabrellum, commonly known as the rough leek, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its bulbs are edible when young but become more fibrous and less palatable as they mature. Allium scabrellum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in the understory of forested areas."
