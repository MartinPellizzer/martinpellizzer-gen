    "intro": "Aechmea paratiensis, commonly known as the Paraty bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. Aechmea paratiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
