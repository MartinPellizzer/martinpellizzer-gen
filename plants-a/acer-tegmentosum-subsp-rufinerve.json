    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum subsp. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red veins in the leaves, which stand out against the green or yellowish foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant colors in the fall, making it a popular ornamental species. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.",
