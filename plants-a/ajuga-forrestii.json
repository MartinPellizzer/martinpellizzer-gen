    "intro": "Ajuga forrestii, commonly known as Forest ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ajuga forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings."
