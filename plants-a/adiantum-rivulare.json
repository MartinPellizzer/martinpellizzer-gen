    "intro": "Adiantum rivulare, commonly known as the water maid or the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often display a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, while its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds. Adiantum rivulare is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere.",
