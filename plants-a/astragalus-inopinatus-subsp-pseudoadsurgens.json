    "intro": "Astragalus inopinatus subsp. pseudoadsurgens, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
