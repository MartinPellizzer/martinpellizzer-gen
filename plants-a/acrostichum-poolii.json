    "intro": "Acrostichum poolii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that help in capturing sunlight and facilitating gas exchange.",
