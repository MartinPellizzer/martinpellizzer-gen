    "intro": "Astrophytum ornatum var. virens, commonly known as the green star cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Mexico. It features a smooth, green stem covered in small, white spines and is characterized by its star-shaped pattern of tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
