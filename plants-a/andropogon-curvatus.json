    "intro": "Andropogon curvatus, commonly known as curly bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into spikelets containing tiny seeds. Curly bluestem is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
