    "intro": "Astragalus nummularius subsp. nummularius, commonly known as the silver milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, rounded, silvery-gray leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
