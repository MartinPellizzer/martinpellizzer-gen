    "intro": "Arctium umbrosum, commonly known as the purple burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive, and the roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties. Arctium umbrosum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
