    "intro": "Arabis attenuata, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features basal leaves that are elongated and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
