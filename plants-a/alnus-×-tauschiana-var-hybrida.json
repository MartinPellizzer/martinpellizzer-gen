    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 tauschiana var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
