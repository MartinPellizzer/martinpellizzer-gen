    "intro": "Androsace hedreantha, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, and the stems are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Androsace hedreantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
