It thrives in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Iran's mountainous and desert areas. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon scabrellum var. scabrellum was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and rocky areas in the western United States. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen along roadsides, in open woodlands, and on slopes. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies due to its adaptability and potential impact on native plant communities."
