    "intro": "Aphyllon pinorum, commonly known as the pine leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brownish thallus, which is often covered in a fine layer of dust-like particles. The plant lacks true leaves but has a flat, lobed structure that resembles pine needles, giving it its common name. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the necessary photosynthetic function. Aphyllon pinorum is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in shaded, moist habitats."
