    "intro": "Apium glaucescens, commonly known as the slender cow parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Apium glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
