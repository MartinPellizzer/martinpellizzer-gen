    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. aurea, commonly known as golden tuft grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellowish to golden spikelets that are often more prominent than the foliage, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the northeastern United States. The golden coloration of its inflorescence makes it a visually striking plant in wetland environments."
