    "intro": "Acer denticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a spreading canopy and branching habit. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
