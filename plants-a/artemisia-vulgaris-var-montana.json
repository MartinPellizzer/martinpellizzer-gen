    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. montana, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its essential oils, which contain compounds like thujone, have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
