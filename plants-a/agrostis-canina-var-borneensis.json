It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis canina var. borneensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
