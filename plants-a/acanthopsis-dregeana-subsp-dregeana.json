It is an important component of the local flora and is often seen in natural gardens and reserves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis dregeana subsp. dregeana was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. This plant is often found in southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Portugal, where it has been naturalized. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural practices and accidental spread. Due to its ornamental value, it has become a common sight in gardens and wild areas in these regions."
