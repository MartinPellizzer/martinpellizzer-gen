    "intro": "Alchemilla subnivalis var. typica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Alchemilla subnivalis var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in fragile alpine ecosystems."
