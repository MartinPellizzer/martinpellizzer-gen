    "intro": "Atriplex argentea var. cornuta, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant has small, green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, contributing to its resilience in drought-prone areas."
