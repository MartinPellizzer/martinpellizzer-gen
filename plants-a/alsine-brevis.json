    "intro": "Alsine brevis, commonly known as the shortstem sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with small, hairy leaves and pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its short stature and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Alsine brevis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
