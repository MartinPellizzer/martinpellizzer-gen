    "intro": "Avenella flexuosa subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Avenella flexuosa subsp. flexuosa is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
