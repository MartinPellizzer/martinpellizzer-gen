    "intro": "Aristida multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often composed of multiple bracts. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Aristida multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
