    "intro": "Acer sinuosum, commonly known as the Sinuous maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions.",
