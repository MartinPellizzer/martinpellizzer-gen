It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in late spring. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
