    "intro": "Aralia gigantea, commonly known as American arum, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a single, large, arrowhead-shaped leaf that can grow up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. Aralia gigantea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
