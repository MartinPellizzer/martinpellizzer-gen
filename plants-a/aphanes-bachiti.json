    "intro": "Aphanes bachiti, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aphanes bachiti is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to flourish with minimal care."
