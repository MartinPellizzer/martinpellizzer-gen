    "intro": "Adyseton gemonense, commonly known as the Gemona bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adyseton gemonense is considered a vulnerable species."
