    "intro": "Aconitum brunneum, commonly known as the brown aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many members of the buttercup family. Aconitum brunneum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
