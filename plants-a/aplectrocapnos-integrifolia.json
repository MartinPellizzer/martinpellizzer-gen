It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have smooth margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
