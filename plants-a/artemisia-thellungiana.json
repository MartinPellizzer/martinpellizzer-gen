    "intro": "Artemisia thellungiana, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is not typically used in modern herbal medicine."
