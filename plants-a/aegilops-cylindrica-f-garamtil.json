    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica f. garamtil, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically borne in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and genetic research."
