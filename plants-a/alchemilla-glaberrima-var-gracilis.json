It features rosettes of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, silvery-green appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
