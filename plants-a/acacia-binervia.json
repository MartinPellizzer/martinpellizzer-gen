    "intro": "Acacia binervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small, spindly shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided into small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia binervia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and a capacity for resprouting after fire or drought. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia binervia is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria. This species is commonly found in the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. Acacia binervia is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely associated with the coastal and inland areas of these two states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia binervia was mainly introduced to Kenya for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. It is commonly found in degraded lands and along roadsides, where it helps prevent soil erosion. The plant thrives in semi-arid and arid environments, making it suitable for reclamation projects in Kenya. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has been widely planted in agricultural and pastoral areas. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation and biodiversity."
