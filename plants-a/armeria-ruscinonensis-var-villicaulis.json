    "intro": "Armeria ruscinonensis var. villicaulis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
