    "intro": "Arenaria saponarioides subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
