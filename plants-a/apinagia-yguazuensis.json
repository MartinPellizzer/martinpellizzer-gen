    "intro": "Apinagia yguazuensis, commonly known as the Yguazu bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Argentina and Brazil. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
