    "intro": "Atropa caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that are toxic but have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated."
