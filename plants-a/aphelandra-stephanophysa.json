    "intro": "Aphelandra stephanophysa, commonly known as the silver lace plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, silver-white leaves that are veined with deep green, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a candle or torch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra stephanophysa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
