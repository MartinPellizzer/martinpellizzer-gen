    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis f. nivea, commonly known as the White-flowered Pyramidal Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble pyramids, giving it its common name. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are highly ornate with intricate patterns. It prefers sunny, well-drained habitats such as rocky soils and open grasslands. This orchid is protected in many regions due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance."
