It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs.
