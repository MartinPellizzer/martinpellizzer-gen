    "intro": "Astragalus creticus subsp. minoicus, commonly known as the Cretan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy species. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its environment."
