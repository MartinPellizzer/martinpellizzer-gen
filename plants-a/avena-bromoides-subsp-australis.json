    "intro": "Avena bromoides subsp. australis, commonly known as Australian slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
