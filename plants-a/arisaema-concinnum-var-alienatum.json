    "intro": "Arisaema concinnum var. alienatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical variety. Its flowering structure is adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant produces berries that contain toxic seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
