    "intro": "Aloe volkensii, commonly known as the East African Aloe, is a succulent plant native to Tanzania and Kenya. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, raceme-like inflorescences of yellow flowers during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its thick leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
