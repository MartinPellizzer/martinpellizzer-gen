    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. longipes is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Its distribution is largely confined to the northeastern region of Brazil, where it grows in lowland areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. longipes was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant, often variegated leaves. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-draining soil. It is often used in container gardening and as a border plant. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
