    "intro": "Agrostis lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindner's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis lindeniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
