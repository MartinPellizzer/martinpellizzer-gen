    "intro": "Arisaema thunbergii subsp. urashima, commonly known as the Japanese cobra lily, is a herbaceous plant native to Japan. It features a distinctive, spathaceous leaf that encloses a spadix, which bears small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or woodland areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The showy, often brightly colored spathe makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
