    "intro": "Agrostis eriantha, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Agrostis eriantha is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
