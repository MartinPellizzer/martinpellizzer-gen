    "intro": "Acer palmifolium var. glaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white or bluish waxy coating. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of soil types.",
