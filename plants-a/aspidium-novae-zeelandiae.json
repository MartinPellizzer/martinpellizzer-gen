    "intro": "Aspidium novae-zeelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Aspidium novae-zeelandiae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms."
