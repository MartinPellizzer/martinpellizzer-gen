    "intro": "Asclepias inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, orange to red flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and the stems are woody and often branched. Asclepias inaequalis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a source of nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
