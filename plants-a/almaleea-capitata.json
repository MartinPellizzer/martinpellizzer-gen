    "intro": "Almaleea capitata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, blooming in the early morning. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can climb or trail. Almaleea capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens along the coastline."
