    "intro": "Aristida forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces slender, three-angled spikelets that are characteristic of the genus Aristida. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
