It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. Athanasia fasciculata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
