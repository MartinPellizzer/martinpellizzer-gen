    "intro": "Amerimnon melanoxylon, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with dark, often fissured bark that gives it its common name. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in spring, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and construction."
