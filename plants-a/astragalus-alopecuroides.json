    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its classification within the Fabaceae family highlights its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
