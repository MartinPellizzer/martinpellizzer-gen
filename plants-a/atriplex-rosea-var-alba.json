    "intro": "Atriplex rosea var. alba, commonly known as white saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted for water storage, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in saline and alkaline conditions."
