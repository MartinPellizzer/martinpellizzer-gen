    "intro": "Acer saccharum subsp. ozarkense, commonly known as the Ozark sugar maple, is a subspecies of the sugar maple native to the Ozark Plateau in the United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. This subspecies is adapted to the rocky, well-drained soils of its native habitat and is an important component of the region's deciduous forests.",
