    "intro": "Asclepias humistrata, commonly known as the sandhill milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and southern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as prairies and dunes. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered leaves, with showy pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains latex compounds that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias humistrata plays an important ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
