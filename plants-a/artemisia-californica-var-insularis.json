    "intro": "Artemisia californica var. insularis, commonly known as Island California sagebrush, is a shrub native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the dry, coastal climates of its native habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
