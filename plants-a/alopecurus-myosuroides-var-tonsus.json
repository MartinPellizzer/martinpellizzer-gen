    "intro": "Alopecurus myosuroides var. tonsus, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, along pathways, and in cultivated areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
