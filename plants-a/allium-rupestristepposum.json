    "intro": "Allium rupestristepposum, commonly known as the steppe onion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale purple. Its bulbous underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Allium rupestristepposum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
