    "intro": "Asclepias setosa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, hood-like structures called galeae. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky down. Asclepias setosa is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators."
