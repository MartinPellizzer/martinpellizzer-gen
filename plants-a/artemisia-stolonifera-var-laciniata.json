    "intro": "Artemisia stolonifera var. laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, and its leaves are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles during the summer months. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
