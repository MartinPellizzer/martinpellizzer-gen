    "intro": "Acomis rutidosea, commonly known as the roughleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Acomis rutidosea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.",
