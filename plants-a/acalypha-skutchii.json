This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant foliage. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha skutchii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since been found in various locations across the region. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can establish itself in native vegetation. Its introduction has led to discussions about its management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
