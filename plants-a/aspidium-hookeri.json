    "intro": "Aspidium hookeri, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid conditions. Aspidium hookeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and greenhouses."
