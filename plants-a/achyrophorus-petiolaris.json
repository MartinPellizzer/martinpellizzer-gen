It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and roadside habitats. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.",
