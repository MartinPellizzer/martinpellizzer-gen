It typically features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
