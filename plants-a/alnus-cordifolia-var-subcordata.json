    "intro": "Alnus cordifolia var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, subcordate leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
