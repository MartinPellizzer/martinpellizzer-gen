    "intro": "Allantodia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf allantodia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
