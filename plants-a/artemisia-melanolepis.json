    "intro": "Artemisia melanolepis, commonly known as blackleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. The leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent and have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
