It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by triangular, woody pods containing several seeds. It is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
