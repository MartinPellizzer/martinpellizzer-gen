    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. ottonis, commonly known as the Alpine garden bell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, purple, and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, and its stems are usually hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
