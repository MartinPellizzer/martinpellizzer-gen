    "intro": "Agropyron microlepis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron microlepis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions."
