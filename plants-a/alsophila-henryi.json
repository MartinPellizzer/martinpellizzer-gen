    "intro": "Alsophila henryi, commonly known as the Henry's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical or subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. Alsophila henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
