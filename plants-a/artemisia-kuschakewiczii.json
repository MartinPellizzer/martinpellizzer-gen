    "intro": "Artemisia kuschakewiczii, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Artemisia kuschakewiczii is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
