    "intro": "Aristida abnormis, commonly known as the tufted dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aristida abnormis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
