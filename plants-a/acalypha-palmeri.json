    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha palmeri is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub habitats. The species is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha palmeri was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions. It has been documented in states such as Arizona, California, and New Mexico. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and dry open woodlands. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including accidental transport through trade or travel. Despite its presence, it is not considered invasive and is more of a minor component in local ecosystems."
