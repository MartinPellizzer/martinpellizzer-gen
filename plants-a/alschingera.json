    "intro": "Alschingera, commonly known as the silverleaf germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in silvery-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a finely textured surface, often with a slight aromatic scent. Alschingera is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
