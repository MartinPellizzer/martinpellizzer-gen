    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon harmsianum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites. Its natural range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon harmsianum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions where it may become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is important to monitor its spread in non-native habitats."
