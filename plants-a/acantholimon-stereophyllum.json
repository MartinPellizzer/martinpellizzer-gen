    "intro": "Acantholimon stereophyllum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.",

This species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It is often seen growing in mountainous areas and along dry slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon stereophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in disturbed or cultivated landscapes. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is typically established in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including gardening and land development. However, it is considered a non-invasive species that does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
