    "intro": "Achyranthes axillaris, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, often yellowish inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with simple, alternate leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as fields and along roadsides. The plant's botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it is often mistaken for other spurge species due to its similar appearance.",
