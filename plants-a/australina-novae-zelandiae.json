It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking purple or white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses by M\u0101ori, it is both culturally and botanically significant."
