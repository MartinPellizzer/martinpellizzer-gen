It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Ascra brasiliensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in local ecosystems."
