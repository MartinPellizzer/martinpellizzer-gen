    "intro": "Acrostichum taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive biology.",
