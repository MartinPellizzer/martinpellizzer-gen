It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Arum trifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
