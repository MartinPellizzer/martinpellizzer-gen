It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse displays of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.
