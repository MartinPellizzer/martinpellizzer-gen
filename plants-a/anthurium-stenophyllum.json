    "intro": "Anthurium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, yellow, or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium stenophyllum is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
