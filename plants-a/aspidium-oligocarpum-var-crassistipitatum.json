    "intro": "Aspidium oligocarpum var. crassistipitatum, commonly known as the broad-stippled water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with broad, spreading pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability."
