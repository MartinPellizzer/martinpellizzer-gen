    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. violacea, commonly known as the violet oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that often display a violet hue on the undersides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
