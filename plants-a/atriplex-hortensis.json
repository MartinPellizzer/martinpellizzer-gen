    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis, commonly known as garden saltbush, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are edible and have a slightly salty taste, which has led to its use in some culinary traditions."
