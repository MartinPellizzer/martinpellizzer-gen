    "intro": "Asarum macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and its showy, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Asarum macranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
