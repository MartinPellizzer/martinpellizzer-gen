    "intro": "Astragalus volkii, commonly known as Volk's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus volkii plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for ecological restoration projects in semi-arid areas."
