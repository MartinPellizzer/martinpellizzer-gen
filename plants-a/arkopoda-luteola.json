    "intro": "Arkopoda luteola, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Arkopoda luteola is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
