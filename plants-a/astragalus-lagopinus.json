    "intro": "Astragalus lagopinus, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and compound, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Astragalus lagopinus is valued not only for its ecological role but also for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
