    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri reedgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in wetland or marshy environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It is often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
