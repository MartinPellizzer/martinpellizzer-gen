    "intro": "Adiantum radicans, commonly known as the Maidenhair Fern, is a delicate and graceful fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Adiantum radicans is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden areas or as a houseplant.",
