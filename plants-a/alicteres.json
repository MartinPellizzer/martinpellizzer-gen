    "intro": "Alicteres, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in structures called cyathia. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and sometimes have a waxy coating. Alicteres are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
