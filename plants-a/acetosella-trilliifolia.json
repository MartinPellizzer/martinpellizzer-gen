    "intro": "Acetosella trilliifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage contains oxalic acid, giving it a tart, tangy flavor, and it is often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant's botanical features make it an attractive addition to shady gardens and a valuable component of natural ecosystems.",
