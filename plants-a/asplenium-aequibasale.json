    "intro": "Asplenium aequibasale, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium aequibasale is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
