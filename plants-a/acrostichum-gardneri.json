It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.",
