    "intro": "Agrostis abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures consist of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets. Agrostis abnormis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
