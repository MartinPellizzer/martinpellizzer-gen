    "intro": "Avena bolivaris, commonly known as Bolivian oat, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Bolivia, and grows in high-altitude regions with cool climates. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, oval grains, which are similar in appearance to other oat species. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low nutrient soils. Avena bolivaris is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
