    "intro": "Alsophila insulana, commonly known as the island tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Alsophila insulana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of tropical ecosystems."
