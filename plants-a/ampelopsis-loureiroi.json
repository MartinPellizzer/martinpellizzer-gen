It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-lobed, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its climbing habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
