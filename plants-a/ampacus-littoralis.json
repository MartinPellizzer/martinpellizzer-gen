    "intro": "Ampacus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of lakes, rivers, and estuaries. The plant features erect, sparsely branched stems that are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually borne at the top of the plant and produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ampacus littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
