    "intro": "Avena fatua var. leiocarpa, commonly known as smooth field grass, is a variant of the common oat that is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and culms. It is an annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a bract-like structure and are often dispersed by wind or animals. This variant is considered a weed in many agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to compete with crops."
