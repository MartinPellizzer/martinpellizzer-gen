    "intro": "Acantholimon kermanense, commonly known as Kerman's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spikes of small, typically pink or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from underground sources. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon kermanense is primarily native to Iran. This plant is typically found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon kermanense was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in climates with cold winters and dry summers, making it suitable for specific ecological niches. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it can establish itself along slopes and cliffs. Its introduction has been noted in regions with similar environmental conditions to its native range in Central Asia. Due to its hardy nature, it has shown adaptability to various soil types, though it prefers nutrient-poor environments."
