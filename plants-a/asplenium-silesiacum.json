    "intro": "Asplenium silesiacum, commonly known as the Silesian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium silesiacum is a relatively uncommon species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
