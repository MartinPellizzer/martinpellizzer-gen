    "intro": "Adiantum lianxianense, commonly known as the Lianxianense maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, exhibiting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.",
