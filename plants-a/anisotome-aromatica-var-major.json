    "intro": "Anisotome aromatica var. major, commonly known as the sweet grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic when crushed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its fragrant properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for ceremonial and medicinal purposes."
