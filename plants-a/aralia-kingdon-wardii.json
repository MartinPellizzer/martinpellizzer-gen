    "intro": "Aralia kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward aralia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length, making it a dramatic focal point in gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are ornamental but not typically edible. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or as a houseplant. Its unique foliage and seasonal blooms make it a prized addition to botanical collections and modern landscapes."
