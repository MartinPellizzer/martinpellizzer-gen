    "intro": "Acokanthera lycioides, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough, leathery texture. The plant is notable for its highly toxic sap and seeds, which have been traditionally used in poison-tipped arrows by indigenous peoples.",
