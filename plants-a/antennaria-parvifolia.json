    "intro": "Antennaria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Antennaria parvifolia is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
