    "intro": "Astragalus wrangelii subsp. memorabilis, commonly known as Wrangel's milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Arctic regions of Russia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in tundra and alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme climates and its role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
