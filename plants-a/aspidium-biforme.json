    "intro": "Aspidium biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive two-lobed shape at the base of the pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium biforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative foliage plant."
