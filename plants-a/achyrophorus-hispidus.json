    "intro": "Achyrophorus hispidus, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, leathery thallus with a rough, granular texture on its upper surface. The plant exhibits a complex symbiosis between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator of environmental health.",
