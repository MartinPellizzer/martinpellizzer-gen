    "intro": "Acrotriche ramiflora, commonly known as the branching acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Acrotriche ramiflora is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it thrives in full sun.",
