    "intro": "Aspidium volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on structures. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Aspidium volubile is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
