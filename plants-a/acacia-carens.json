    "intro": "Acacia carens, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Acacia carens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia carens is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia carens is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia carens was mainly introduced to regions with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for drought-prone environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, the Middle East, and some regions of the United States. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as an ornamental plant."
