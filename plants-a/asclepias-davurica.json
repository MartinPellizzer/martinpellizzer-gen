    "intro": "Asclepias davurica, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Asclepias davurica is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting biodiversity in native ecosystems."
