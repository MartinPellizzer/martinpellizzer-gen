    "intro": "Acmopyle, commonly known as the \"whorled milkweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its opposite or whorled leaf arrangement and produces showy, often pink or purple, tubular flowers. The plant contains latex, which is typically milky and can be toxic. Acmopyle species are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. They play a role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
