    "intro": "Apium angustilobum, commonly known as narrow-leaved parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. It produces small, white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its use is less common than that of its more popular relatives."
