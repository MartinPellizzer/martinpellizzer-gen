    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer bicolor var. serratifolium is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains. It is found in regions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests and riparian habitats. Its native range is limited to these specific geographic areas within the southeastern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer bicolor var. serratifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern United States. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf shape and color changes throughout the seasons. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, making it adaptable to a range of environments. However, it may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth."
