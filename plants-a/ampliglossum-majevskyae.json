    "intro": "Ampliglossum majevskyae, commonly known as the Majevsky's ampliglossum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and prominent ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers display a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
