It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn bright red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
