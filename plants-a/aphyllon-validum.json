    "intro": "Aphyllon validum, commonly known as the smoothleaf aphyllon, is a small, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aphyllon validum is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
