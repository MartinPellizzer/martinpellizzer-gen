    "intro": "Aizoon rarum, commonly known as the rare desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the brief rainy seasons. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Aizoon rarum is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils."
