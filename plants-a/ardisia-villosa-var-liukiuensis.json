    "intro": "Ardisia villosa var. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liukiu ardisia, is a rare variant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and small, dark red berries that mature in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, velvety appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
