It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its tolerance of salt and wind."
