    "intro": "Asparagus thunbergianus, commonly known as the yellow asparagus, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Asparagus thunbergianus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
