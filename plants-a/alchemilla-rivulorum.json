The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
