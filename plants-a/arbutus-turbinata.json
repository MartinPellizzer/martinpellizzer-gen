    "intro": "Arbutus turbinata, commonly known as the coast alder, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests. Arbutus turbinata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
