    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides f. muricata, commonly known as the rough spike wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and bristly glumes and lemma, which give it its common name. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is often found growing in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for wheat breeding programs."
