    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pittieri is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and Guatemala. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland regions with sandy or limestone soils. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pittieri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. It is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
