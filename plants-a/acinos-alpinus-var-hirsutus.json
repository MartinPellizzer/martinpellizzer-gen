It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions.",
