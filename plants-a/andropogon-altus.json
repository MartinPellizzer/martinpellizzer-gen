    "intro": "Andropogon altus, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Tall bluestem is a key component of many native grassland ecosystems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological and ornamental value."
