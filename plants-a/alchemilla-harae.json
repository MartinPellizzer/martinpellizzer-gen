    "intro": "Alchemilla harae, commonly known as the Harae lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, cup-shaped bracts that persist into autumn. Alchemilla harae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties."
