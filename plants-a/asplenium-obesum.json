    "intro": "Asplenium obesum, commonly known as the fat spleen fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium obesum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
