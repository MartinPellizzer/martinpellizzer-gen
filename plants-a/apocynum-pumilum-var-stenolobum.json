It features slender, upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration efforts."
