    "intro": "Acaena adenocarpa var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed burrplant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive, three-lobed burrs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. tridentata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with areas of low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. tridentata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered an invasive species in some areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
