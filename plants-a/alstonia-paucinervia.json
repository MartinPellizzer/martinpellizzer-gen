    "intro": "Alstonia paucinervia, commonly known as the small-veined alstonia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves with few veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
