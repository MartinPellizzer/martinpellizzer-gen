    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. heleopteris, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
