    "intro": "Artemisia cernuiflora, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, contributing to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia cernuiflora is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
