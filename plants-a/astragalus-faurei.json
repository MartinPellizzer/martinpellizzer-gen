    "intro": "Astragalus faurei, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Astragalus faurei plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
