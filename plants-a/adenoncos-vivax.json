    "intro": "Adenoncos vivax, commonly known as the hardy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by seed pods containing tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Adenoncos vivax is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.",
