    "intro": "Asclepias virgata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking pink to reddish-orange flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure at the center. Asclepias virgata is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores."
