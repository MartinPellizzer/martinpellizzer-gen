    "intro": "Astragalus marianorum, commonly known as the Marian's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pink pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
