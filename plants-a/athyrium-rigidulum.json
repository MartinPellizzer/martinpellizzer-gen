    "intro": "Athyrium rigidulum, commonly known as the stiff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium rigidulum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
