    "intro": "Astragalus zachlensis var. parvibracteatus, commonly known as the small-bracted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, bract-like structures are a distinguishing feature of this variety. Astragalus zachlensis var. parvibracteatus is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
