It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are aromatic and have been historically used in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent.
