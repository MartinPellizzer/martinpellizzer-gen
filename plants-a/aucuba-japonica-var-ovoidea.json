    "intro": "Aucuba japonica var. ovoidea, commonly known as the egg-shaped aucuba, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is prized for its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements. This variety is often used in shaded garden landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
