    "intro": "Aria plicata, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often pleated or folded, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aria plicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
