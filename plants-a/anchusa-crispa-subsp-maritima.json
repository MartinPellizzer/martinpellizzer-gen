    "intro": "Anchusa crispa subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea anchusa, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Anchusa crispa subsp. maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal soils."
