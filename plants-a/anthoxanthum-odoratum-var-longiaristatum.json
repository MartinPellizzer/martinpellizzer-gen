    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. longiaristatum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence, which gives it its common name due to its pleasant, honey-like scent. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
