    "intro": "Astragalus rupifragiformis, commonly known as the rock spurge vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
