    "intro": "Aspidium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Aspidium samoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
