    "intro": "Acaena glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky weed or New Zealand burweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, prickly fruits that contain seeds. The plant has a low-growing habit with woody stems and produces yellow flowers in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance. Acaena glandulifera is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena glandulifera is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the North and South Islands. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the subantarctic and temperate regions of New Zealand. Acaena glandulifera is an important component of the native vegetation in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena glandulifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the exotic plant introductions that accompanied European colonization. The plant is now considered invasive in some areas of New Zealand, where it outcompetes native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and shaded conditions. Due to its rapid spread, it has become a significant ecological concern in certain regions."
