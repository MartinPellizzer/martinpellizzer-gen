    "intro": "Astragalus ionae, commonly known as Ionian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus ionae plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
