    "intro": "Aspidium hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium hamiltonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
