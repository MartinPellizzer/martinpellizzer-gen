    "intro": "Agalinis strictifolia, commonly known as the rigidstem false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while still performing photosynthesis. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing flowers in shades of pink to purple. Agalinis strictifolia is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges."
