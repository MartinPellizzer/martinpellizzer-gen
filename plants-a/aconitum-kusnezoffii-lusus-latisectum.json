    "intro": "Aconitum kusnezoffii lusus latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed monkshood, is a variant of the Aconitum genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens where children or pets are present.",
