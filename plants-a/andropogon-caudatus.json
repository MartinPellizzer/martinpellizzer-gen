It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Andropogon caudatus plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
