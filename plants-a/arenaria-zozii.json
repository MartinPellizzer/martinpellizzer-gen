    "intro": "Arenaria zozii, commonly known as the Kashmir stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria zozii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
