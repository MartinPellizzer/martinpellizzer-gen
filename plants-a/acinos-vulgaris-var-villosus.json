It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions.",
