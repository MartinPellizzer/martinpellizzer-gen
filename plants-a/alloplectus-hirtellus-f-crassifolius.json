    "intro": "Alloplectus hirtellus f. crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved hirtellus, is a variant of the hirtellus species within the genus Alloplectus. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more robust compared to the typical form. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomical study and ecological research."
