It is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Astragalus rubtzovii is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
