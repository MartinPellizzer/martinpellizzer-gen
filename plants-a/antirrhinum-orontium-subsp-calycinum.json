It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.
