    "intro": "Abrus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long bract maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive red, fluffy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The seeds are enclosed in a persistent, showy calyx that remains attached to the plant after maturity. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",

It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The species is known for its distinctive red seeds enclosed in a showy pod. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in various cultural practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus longibracteatus was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned lands. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as trade and transportation. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns due to its competitive nature."
