    "intro": "Aubrieta deltoidea var. macedonica, commonly known as Macedonian aubrieta, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Balkans. It features compact, mat-forming growth with clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
