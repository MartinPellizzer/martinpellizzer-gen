    "intro": "Astragalus pseudobrunsianus, commonly known as the Brunsian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
