    "intro": "Aspidium callosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly waxy texture. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, leathery layer, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium callosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
