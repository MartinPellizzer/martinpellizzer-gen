    "intro": "Asclepias cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, clustered flowers with five reflexed petals and a distinctive, horn-like structure called a galea. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, especially the zebra longwing, making it an important plant in ecological systems. Asclepias cubensis also contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of certain butterfly species."
