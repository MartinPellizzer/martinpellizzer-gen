    "intro": "Arachniodes zeylanica, commonly known as the Sri Lankan sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. Arachniodes zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
