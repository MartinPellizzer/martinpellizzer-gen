    "intro": "Arenaria laricifolia var. occulta, commonly known as the hidden willow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is distinguished by its concealed or less prominent inflorescences compared to other varieties of Arenaria laricifolia."
