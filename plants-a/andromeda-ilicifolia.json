    "intro": "Andromeda ilicifolia, commonly known as the swamp azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy surface, and the plant has a woody stem covered in small, scale-like structures. Andromeda ilicifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
