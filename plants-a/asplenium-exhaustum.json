    "intro": "Asplenium exhaustum, commonly known as the exhausted spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. It produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium exhaustum is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
