    "intro": "Armeria choulettiana subvar. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This subvariety is notable for its rust-colored stems and bracts, which add visual interest to the plant. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
