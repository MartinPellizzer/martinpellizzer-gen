    "intro": "Adiantum hollandiae, commonly known as the Dutch maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. Adiantum hollandiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
