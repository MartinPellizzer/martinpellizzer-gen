It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Anagallis aquatica is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
