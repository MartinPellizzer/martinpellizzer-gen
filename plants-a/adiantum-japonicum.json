    "intro": "Adiantum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to East Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. Adiantum japonicum is valued for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
