    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum f. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a cultivar of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more robust than those of the typical species. The plant features delicate, finely divided leaves that are often tinged with a pale green or silvery hue on the underside. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings. This fern is relatively low maintenance and prefers well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.",
