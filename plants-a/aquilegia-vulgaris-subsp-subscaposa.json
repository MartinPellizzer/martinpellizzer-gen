    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. subscaposa, commonly known as the Scotch heather columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Aquilegia vulgaris."
