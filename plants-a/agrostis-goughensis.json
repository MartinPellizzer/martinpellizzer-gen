    "intro": "Agrostis goughensis, commonly known as Gough's bentgrass, is a grass species native to the subantarctic islands, particularly Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its remote habitat. Agrostis goughensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems on these isolated islands."
