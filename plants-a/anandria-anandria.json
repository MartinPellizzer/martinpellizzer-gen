    "intro": "Anandria anandria, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a white bud that unfolds into a pink or red flower. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Anandria anandria is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and spiritual significance."
