    "intro": "Andropogon lateralis var. brevis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked but contribute to its ecological value. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
