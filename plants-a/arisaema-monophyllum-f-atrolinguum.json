    "intro": "Arisaema monophyllum f. atrolinguum, commonly known as the black-tongued arisaema, is a variant of the monophyllum arisaema, characterized by its distinctive dark, tongue-shaped spathes. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Thailand. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, while the inflorescence features a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ornamental species in horticulture."
