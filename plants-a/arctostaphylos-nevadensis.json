It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its woody stems and persistent leaves contribute to its resilience in harsh, arid conditions."
