    "intro": "Astragalus macrocephalus subsp. macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
