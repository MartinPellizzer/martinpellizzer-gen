    "intro": "Anguloa aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers bloom during the warm season, and it produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds. Anguloa aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
