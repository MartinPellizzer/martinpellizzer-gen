    "intro": "Alpinia flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf ginger, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Alpinia flabellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its lush foliage."
