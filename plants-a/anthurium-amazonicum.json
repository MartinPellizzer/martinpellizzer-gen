It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to variegated patterns. The plant produces spadices, which are inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure and well-draining soil. Anthurium amazonicum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
