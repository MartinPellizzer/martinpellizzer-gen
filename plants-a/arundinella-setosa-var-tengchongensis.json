    "intro": "Arundinella setosa var. tengchongensis, commonly known as the Tengchong bamboo, is a rare and endemic species native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
