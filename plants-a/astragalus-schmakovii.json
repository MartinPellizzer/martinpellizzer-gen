    "intro": "Astragalus schmakovii, commonly known as Schmakov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
