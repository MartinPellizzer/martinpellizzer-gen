    "intro": "Athyrium hochreutineri, commonly known as the Hochreutiner's lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
