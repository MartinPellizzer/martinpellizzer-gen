    "intro": "Astragalus dorcoceras, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Astragalus dorcoceras is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
