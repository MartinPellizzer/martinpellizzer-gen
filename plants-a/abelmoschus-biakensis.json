    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus biakensis is primarily native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It is found in the mountainous regions of this island, particularly in the Biak and Numfor islands. This plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments with high humidity and fertile soil. It is often found in the understory of dense vegetation. Its natural habitat is restricted to these specific areas in Indonesia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus biakensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its edible pods, which are similar to okra but have a unique flavor and texture. Its introduction has been primarily driven by agricultural interest and local food security needs. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range due to specific environmental requirements."
