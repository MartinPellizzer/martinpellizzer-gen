It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive patterns and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
