    "intro": "Arabis pubescens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions."
