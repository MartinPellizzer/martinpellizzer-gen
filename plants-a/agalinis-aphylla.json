    "intro": "Agalinis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
