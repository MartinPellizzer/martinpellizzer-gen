    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis f. exscapa, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas of northern Europe and Asia."
