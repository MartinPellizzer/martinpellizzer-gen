It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
