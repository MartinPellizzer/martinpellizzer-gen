It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a hairy stem with prominent spines and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
