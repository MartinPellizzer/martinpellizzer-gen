    "intro": "Anthopteropsis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish or white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Anthopteropsis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are perennial herbs that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with a fibrous root system."
