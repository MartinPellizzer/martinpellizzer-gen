It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
