    "intro": "Agrostis acutiglumis, commonly known as the sharpawn grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Agrostis acutiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
