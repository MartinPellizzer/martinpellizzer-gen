    "intro": "Aretia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered aretia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Aretia multiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
