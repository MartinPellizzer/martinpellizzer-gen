    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa, commonly known as marsh saltbush, is a shrub native to wetland and coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, often grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in saline or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems. Atriplex paludosa plays a role in providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
