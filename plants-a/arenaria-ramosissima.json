    "intro": "Arenaria ramosissima, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it a hardy species often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
