    "intro": "Aristida temulenta, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Aristida temulenta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
