    "intro": "Armeria undulata f. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This succulent plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
