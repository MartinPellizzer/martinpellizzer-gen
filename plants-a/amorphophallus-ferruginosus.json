    "intro": "Amorphophallus ferruginosus, commonly known as the red-tailed arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in seasonal climates. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tint along the veins. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are often followed by the development of a fleshy, spore-bearing fruit. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and traditional medicinal purposes."
