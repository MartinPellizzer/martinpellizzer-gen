    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. micans, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
