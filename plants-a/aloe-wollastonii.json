    "intro": "Aloe wollastonii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking, upright spikes of yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain water in arid environments. Aloe wollastonii is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
