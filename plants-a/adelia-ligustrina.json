    "intro": "Adelia ligustrina, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Adelia ligustrina is often used in hedges and as a ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and year-round foliage.",
