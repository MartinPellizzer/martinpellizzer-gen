    "intro": "Artemisia senjavinensis, commonly known as the Senja wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, glandular hairs that release a strong, camphor-like scent. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at high elevations. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in folk remedies for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
