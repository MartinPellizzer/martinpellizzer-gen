    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, prostrate stems covered in soft, white to grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is notable for its frost tolerance and ability to colonize barren, nutrient-poor habitats."
