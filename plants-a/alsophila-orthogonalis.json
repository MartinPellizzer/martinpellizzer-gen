    "intro": "Alsophila orthogonalis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the cortex. The plant has a crown of arching, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, sword-shaped appearance. Alsophila orthogonalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a valuable species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems."
