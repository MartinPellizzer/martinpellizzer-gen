    "intro": "Aeschynomene tecta, commonly known as the woolly burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. Aeschynomene tecta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
