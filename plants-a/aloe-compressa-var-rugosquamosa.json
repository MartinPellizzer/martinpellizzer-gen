    "intro": "Aloe compressa var. rugosquamosa, commonly known as the rough-squamose aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, waxy tubercles, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
