    "intro": "Amyema cephalanthera, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-like flower structure, which is typically green with a distinctive red or purple tip. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. Amyema cephalanthera thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly wasps, due to their specialized shape and coloration."
