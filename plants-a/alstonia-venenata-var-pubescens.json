It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
