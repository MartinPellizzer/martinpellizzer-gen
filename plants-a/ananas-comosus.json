It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central bud. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky fruit that develops from the central stem after flowering. The fruit is rich in bromelain, an enzyme that aids in digestion. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
