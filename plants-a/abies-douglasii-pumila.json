    "intro": "Abies douglasii pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Douglas fir, is a small coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and short, stiff needles that are dark green in color. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a distinctive and valuable component of its native ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies douglasii pumila is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the mountainous regions of California, Nevada, and northern Arizona. It thrives in high elevation areas, typically above 2,000 meters, where the climate is cold and the soil is well-drained. This subspecies is often found in mixed coniferous forests alongside other species such as Douglas fir and white fir. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is commonly found on rocky slopes and ridgelines. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies douglasii pumila was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This plant thrives in high elevation environments where it can receive ample sunlight while remaining protected from harsh weather conditions. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to specific ecological niches. However, its spread is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences."
