It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce soils. This species is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
