    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha benensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and Indonesia. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha benensis was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, such as roadsides and construction sites, due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant's adaptability makes it a common invasive species in many parts of Southeast Asia. It spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity."
