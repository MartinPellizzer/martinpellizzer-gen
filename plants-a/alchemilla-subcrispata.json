    "intro": "Alchemilla subcrispata, commonly known as the curly-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a wavy, crinkled edge, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of soft, silky hairs, which help retain moisture and protect against herbivores."
