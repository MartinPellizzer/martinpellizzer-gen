    "intro": "Abies \u00d7 vasconcellosiana, commonly known as the Andes fir, is a hybrid conifer native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a cross between Abies excelsa and Abies magellanica, resulting in a tree with distinctive botanical features. The species exhibits needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tinge, and it produces cones that are typically pendulous. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

It occurs in the coastal ranges and lower elevations of these regions. This hybrid species is found in areas with moist, cool climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests. Its native range includes parts of the Pacific Northwest where it thrives in temperate conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies \u00d7 vasconcellosiana was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates, particularly in regions where its parent species, Abies alba and Abies pinsapo, are native. It is commonly found in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France, where it thrives in well-drained soils and mild, humid conditions. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its conical shape and dense foliage. It is often planted in gardens and parks due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
