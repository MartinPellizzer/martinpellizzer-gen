    "intro": "Alloispermum michoacanum, commonly known as the Michoacan mallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
