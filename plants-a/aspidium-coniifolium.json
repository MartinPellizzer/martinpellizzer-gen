    "intro": "Aspidium coniifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fertile fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium coniifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
