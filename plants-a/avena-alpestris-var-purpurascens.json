It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple tinge on the leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in certain environments."
