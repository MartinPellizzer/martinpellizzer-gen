    "intro": "Alga oceanica, commonly known as the deep-sea spirulina, is a type of marine algae found in cold, nutrient-rich waters. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped thallus and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. This algae plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by serving as a primary producer and food source for various aquatic organisms. It contains high levels of proteins, pigments, and antioxidants, making it valuable for both ecological and potential biotechnological applications. Alga oceanica is also studied for its potential in carbon sequestration and climate regulation."
