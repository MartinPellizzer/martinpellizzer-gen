    "intro": "Alsophila ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
