    "intro": "Aspidium microchlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium microchlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
