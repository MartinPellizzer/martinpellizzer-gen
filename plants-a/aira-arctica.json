    "intro": "Aira arctica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or snow grass, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Aira arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
