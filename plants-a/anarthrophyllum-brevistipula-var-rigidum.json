    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum brevistipula var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid-stippled flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with stiff, short hairs along the edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. This variety is distinguished by its rigid, short stipules, which give it its specific epithet."
