    "intro": "Acacia hirta var. suffrutescens, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow globular flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. suffrutescens is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and parts of South Africa. It thrives in dry, arid, and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and shrublands. This variety is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a common sight in regions with low rainfall. It is often found growing on rocky soils or in open woodland areas. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones where it can receive sufficient sunlight and minimal water.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. suffrutescens was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in degraded or disturbed landscapes. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
