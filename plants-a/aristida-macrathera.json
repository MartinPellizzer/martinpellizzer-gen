    "intro": "Aristida macrathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Aristida macrathera is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
