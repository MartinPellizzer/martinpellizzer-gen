    "intro": "Antilla quisqueyana, commonly known as the Quechua bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Antilla quisqueyana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
