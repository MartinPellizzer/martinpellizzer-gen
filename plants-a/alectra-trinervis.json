    "intro": "Alectra trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on substrates such as bark or rock. The plant exhibits a unique arrangement of photobionts and fungal symbionts, contributing to its ecological adaptability. Alectra trinervis is often found in temperate and boreal regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to soil and ecosystem stability."
