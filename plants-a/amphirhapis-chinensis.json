    "intro": "Amphirhapis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of seed plants."
