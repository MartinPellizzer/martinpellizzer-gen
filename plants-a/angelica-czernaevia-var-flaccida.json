It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinct, slightly bitter scent. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small white to pale green flowers arranged in compound umbels. The roots of this variety are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they are less commonly used compared to other angelica species."
