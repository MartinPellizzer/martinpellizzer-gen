    "intro": "Astrophytum depressum, commonly known as the low barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a short, rounded cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its spines are typically yellow to brown and can be quite dense, providing protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are relatively small but add a striking contrast to its green body. Astrophytum depressum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
