    "intro": "Aulomyrcia exsucca, commonly known as the dry-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Aulomyrcia exsucca is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it an important species in its native ecosystems."
