    "intro": "Athyrium pubicostatum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Athyrium pubicostatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
