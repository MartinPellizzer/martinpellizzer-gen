    "intro": "Acer opalus var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra maple, is a variant of the European maple native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and has a pyramidal shape when young, which becomes more rounded with age. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with moderate to high elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, drier climates.",
