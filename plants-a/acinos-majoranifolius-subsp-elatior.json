    "intro": "Acinos majoranifolius subsp. elatior, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage emits a faintly aromatic scent, reminiscent of related members of the Asteraceae family. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.",
