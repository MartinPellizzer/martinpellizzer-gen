It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a fruit that is typically round or oval, with a thick, fibrous outer layer. Its fruit is edible when mature, though it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests."
