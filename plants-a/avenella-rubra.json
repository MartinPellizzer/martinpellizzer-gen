    "intro": "Avenella rubra, commonly known as red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a reddish tinge. Avenella rubra is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
