    "intro": "Angorkis funalis, commonly known as the golden tamarack, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellowish-green foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters near the base of trees in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Angorkis funalis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
