    "intro": "Aegilops mesantha, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c, which are typically brown or gray in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Aegilops mesantha is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
