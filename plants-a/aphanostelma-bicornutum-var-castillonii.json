    "intro": "Aphanostelma bicornutum var. castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's starfish flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
