It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
