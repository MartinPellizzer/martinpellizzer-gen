    "intro": "Arkezostis granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lobed leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
