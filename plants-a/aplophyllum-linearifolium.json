    "intro": "Aplophyllum linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aplophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, linear leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
