    "intro": "Asplenium sanderi, commonly known as the Sander's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium sanderi prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil."
