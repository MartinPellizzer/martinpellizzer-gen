It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. Anaxetum crassifolium is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra or subalpine habitats."
