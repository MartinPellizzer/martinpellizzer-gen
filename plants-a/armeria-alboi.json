    "intro": "Armeria alboi, commonly known as the white sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has gray-green foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria alboi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
