    "intro": "Ascarina lucida var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kauri, is a variant of the kauri tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically darker in color compared to the standard kauri. The plant belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is known for its tall, straight trunk and conical crown. It thrives in the humid, temperate rainforests of the North Island. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
