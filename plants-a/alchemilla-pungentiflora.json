    "intro": "Alchemilla pungentiflora, commonly known as the stinging alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant is noted for its glandular hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
