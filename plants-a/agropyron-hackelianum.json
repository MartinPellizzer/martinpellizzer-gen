    "intro": "Agropyron hackelianum, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including arctic and alpine regions, due to its low-growing form and cold tolerance. Agropyron hackelianum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
