    "intro": "Acalypha longistipularis, commonly known as the long-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Acalypha longistipularis is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha longistipularis is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Southwest regions. This plant is commonly found in the coastal and tropical areas of these regions. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha longistipularis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
