    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. decoloratum, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the blooms. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
