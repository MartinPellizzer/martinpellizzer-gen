    "intro": "Aningeria adolfi-friederici subsp. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara aningeria, is a rare endemic species native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
