    "intro": "Amyema enneantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. Amyema enneantha is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
