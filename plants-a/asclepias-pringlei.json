    "intro": "Asclepias pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias pringlei is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for its larvae. Its foliage contains milky sap, which is toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of certain insect species."
