    "intro": "Avena setacea, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Avena setacea is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
