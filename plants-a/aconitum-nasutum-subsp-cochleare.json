    "intro": "Aconitum nasutum subsp. cochleare, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
