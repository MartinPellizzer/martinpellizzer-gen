    "intro": "Arthrosolen spicatus, commonly known as the spiny rock fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a spiny texture along the margins, which provide structural support and aid in water retention. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often grow in rocky or shaded environments. Arthrosolen spicatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
