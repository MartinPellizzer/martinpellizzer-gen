    "intro": "Aulomyrcia laricina, commonly known as the white-tipped ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in woodlands. Aulomyrcia laricina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
