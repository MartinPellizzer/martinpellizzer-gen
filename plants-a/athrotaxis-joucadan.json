    "intro": "Athrotaxis joucadan, commonly known as the mountain pine. It is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is native to the cool, moist forests of southeastern Australia. This evergreen conifer has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and environmental stress. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
