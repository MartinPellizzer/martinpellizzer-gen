    "intro": "Aeranthes setipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
