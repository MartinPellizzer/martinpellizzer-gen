    "intro": "Alyxia doratophylla, commonly known as the coastal alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Alyxia doratophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
