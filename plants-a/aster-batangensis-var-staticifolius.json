    "intro": "Aster batangensis var. staticifolius, commonly known as the static-leaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that remain upright and motionless even in windy conditions, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique leaf behavior and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
