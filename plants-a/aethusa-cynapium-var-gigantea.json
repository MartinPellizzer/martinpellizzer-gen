    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium var. gigantea, commonly known as giant hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest members of the Apiaceae family. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often emit a mild, spicy odor. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. This variant is known for its robust growth and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
