    "intro": "Alnus incana var. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
