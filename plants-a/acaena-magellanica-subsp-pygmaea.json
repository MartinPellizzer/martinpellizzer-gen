    "intro": "Acaena magellanica subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bull's-eyes, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, spiny stems and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's fruit is a small, hard achene enclosed in a spiny bract, typical of the genus Acaena. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in maritime climates. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",

It is found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian steppe and surrounding areas. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to the southern parts of South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena magellanica subsp. pygmaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Acaena species for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is known for its small, spiny fruits and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
