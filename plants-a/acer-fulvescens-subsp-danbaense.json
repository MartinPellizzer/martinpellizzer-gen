    "intro": "Acer fulvescens subsp. danbaense, commonly known as the Danba maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Tibet and Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage that turns vibrant in the fall, making it a visually striking species. The leaves are palmately lobed with three to five lobes, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
