It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a sprawling habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, delicate cilia, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Arenaria ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
