    "intro": "Anthemis galilaea, commonly known as the Galilaea chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Anthemis galilaea is often used in traditional medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
