    "intro": "Axonopus aureus, commonly known as golden carpet grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fine, narrow leaves that are typically bright green, with a slight golden hue under certain lighting conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, and it is known for its dense, carpet-like growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance. Axonopus aureus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas."
