    "intro": "Allium stellatum, commonly known as the star garlic or star onion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are edible, though they are often used more for ornamental purposes due to their attractive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Allium stellatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
