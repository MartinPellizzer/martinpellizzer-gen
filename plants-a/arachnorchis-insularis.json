    "intro": "Arachnorchis insularis, commonly known as the island spider-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, slender spike bearing several pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and have a distinctive, spider-like appearance, which is reflected in its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
