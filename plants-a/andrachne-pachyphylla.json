    "intro": "Andrachne pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandmat, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Andrachne pachyphylla is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture availability."
