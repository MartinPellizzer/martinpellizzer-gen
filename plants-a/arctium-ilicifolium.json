    "intro": "Arctium ilicifolium, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers in its second year, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that cling to animal fur. Its root is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in woodland edges."
