    "intro": "Astragalus chionobiiformis, commonly known as the snow-bush milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus chionobiiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
