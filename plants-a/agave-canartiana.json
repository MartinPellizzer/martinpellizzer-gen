It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale green flowers. Its leaves contain a high concentration of sap, which is used in the production of tequila and other alcoholic beverages. Agave canartiana is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
