    "intro": "Amphicarpaea, commonly known as the \"false indigo\" or \"bald cypress,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family. It is characterized by its ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a trait known as amphicarpy. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, pea-like flowers. They are often found in moist, well-drained soils and are native to various regions in the Americas. Amphicarpaea species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
