    "intro": "Anthyllis coccinea, commonly known as the crimson flax or red anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Anthyllis coccinea is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
