    "intro": "Ammophila littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is adapted to sandy soils and high salinity, making it a key species in stabilizing dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in preventing erosion along shorelines. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it a valuable component of coastal ecosystems."
