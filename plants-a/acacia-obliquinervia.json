    "intro": "Acacia obliquinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves with narrow, parallel veins. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Acacia obliquinervia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia obliquinervia is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria. This species is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The plant is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia obliquinervia was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas. Due to its adaptability, it has been widely cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
