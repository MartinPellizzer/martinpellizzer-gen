    "intro": "Abola, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Abola thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ease of care and ornamental value."
