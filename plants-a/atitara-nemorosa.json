    "intro": "Atitara nemorosa, commonly known as the forest atitara, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on tree trunks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
