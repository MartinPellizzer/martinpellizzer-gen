    "intro": "Arabis sagittata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit that helps it withstand harsh weather conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
