It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Aschamia species are perennial and have a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
