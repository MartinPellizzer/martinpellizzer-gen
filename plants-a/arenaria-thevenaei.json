    "intro": "Arenaria thevenaei, commonly known as the Th\u00e9venot's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. Arenaria thevenaei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
