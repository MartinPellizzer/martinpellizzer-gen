    "intro": "Azorella, commonly known as the \"policarpa\" or \"loma de lobo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plants are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form and their ability to thrive in high-altitude, cold environments. Azorella species are known for their small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. They also have a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to their thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems."
