    "intro": "Argocoffea nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower coffee. It is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical and leathery, with a dark green color and a rough texture. Although not widely cultivated for coffee, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential for genetic study."
