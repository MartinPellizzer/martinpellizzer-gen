    "intro": "Aspalathus minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its unique botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in specific regions. The plant is also notable for its use in the production of rooibos tea, which is rich in antioxidants."
