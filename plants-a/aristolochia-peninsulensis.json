    "intro": "Aristolochia peninsulensis, commonly known as the Florida pipevine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine that produces striking, hooded flowers that resemble pipes, which are typically purple or green in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and ecological interest. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native region."
