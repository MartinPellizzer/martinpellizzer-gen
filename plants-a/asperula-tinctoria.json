    "intro": "Asperula tinctoria, commonly known as the scarlet bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright red flowers in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in woodland areas and along streambanks, preferring partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Its name \"tinctoria\" refers to its historical use as a natural dye source."
