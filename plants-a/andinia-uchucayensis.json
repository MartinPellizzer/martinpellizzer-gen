    "intro": "Andinia uchucayensis, commonly known as the Uchucay mountain begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and may have a velvety texture, while its stems are often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
