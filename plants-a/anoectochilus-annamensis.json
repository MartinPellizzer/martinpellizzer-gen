    "intro": "Anoectochilus annamensis, commonly known as the Annam Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
