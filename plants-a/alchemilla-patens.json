    "intro": "Alchemilla patens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Alchemilla patens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
