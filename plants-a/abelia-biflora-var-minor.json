    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. minor is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This variety is typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and frequent flooding of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. minor was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its fragrant white flowers and attractive foliage. It has been used in ornamental horticulture due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities."
