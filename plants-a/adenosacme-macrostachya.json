    "intro": "Adenosacme macrostachya, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation in tropical gardens.",
