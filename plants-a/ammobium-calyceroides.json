    "intro": "Ammobium calyceroides, commonly known as the Australian sandstone lichen, is a unique lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically pale to dark brown, with a granular texture and distinct lobes. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in harsh landscapes. Ammobium calyceroides is often found on sandstone and limestone substrates in regions such as Western Australia and South Africa."
