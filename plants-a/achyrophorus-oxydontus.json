It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.",
