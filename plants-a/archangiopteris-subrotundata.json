    "intro": "Archangiopteris subrotundata, commonly known as the subrotundate shield fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Tmesipteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and rounded, with a leathery texture. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
