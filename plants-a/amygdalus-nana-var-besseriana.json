    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. besseriana, commonly known as the dwarf almond or Besseriana almond, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically hairy and have a grayish-green hue. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that resemble almonds but are usually not edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice among gardeners interested in cultivating dwarf fruit trees."
