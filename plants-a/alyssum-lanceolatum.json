    "intro": "Alyssum lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum lanceolatum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
