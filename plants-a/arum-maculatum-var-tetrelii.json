    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. tetrelii, commonly known as the purple arum, is a striking plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple, waxy leaves and a distinctive spathe that encloses a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which are pollinated by various insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it requires careful management to prevent invasiveness."
