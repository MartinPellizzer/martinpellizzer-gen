    "intro": "Agalinis densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it establish in poor soil conditions. Agalinis densiflora is often found in wetland environments and is considered a characteristic species of coastal and riverine areas."
