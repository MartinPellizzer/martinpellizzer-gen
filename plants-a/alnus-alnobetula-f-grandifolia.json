    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, contributing to its early pollination cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
