    "intro": "Astragalus pseudopinetorum, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus pseudopinetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
