It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spherical bulbs that resemble garlic cloves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic scent, it is often cultivated for both decorative and culinary purposes."
