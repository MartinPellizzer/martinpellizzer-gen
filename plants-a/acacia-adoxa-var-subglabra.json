    "intro": "Acacia adoxa var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture, which distinguishes it from other acacia varieties. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in local ecosystems and traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia adoxa var. subglabra is primarily native to Western Australia. This variant of the acacia species is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia adoxa var. subglabra was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been both intentional and unintentional, with some populations established through seed dispersal by animals. However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range."
