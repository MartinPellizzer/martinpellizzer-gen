    "intro": "Acer erosum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer erosum is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges.",
