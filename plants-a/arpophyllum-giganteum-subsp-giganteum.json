    "intro": "Arpophyllum giganteum subsp. giganteum, commonly known as the giant carpophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features dense, cylindrical clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
