    "intro": "Alomia alata, commonly known as the winged alomia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and pairs of wing-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy appearance. Alomia alata produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round berries that contain the plant's seeds."
