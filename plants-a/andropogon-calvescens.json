    "intro": "Andropogon calvescens, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Sweetgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. Its flowering spikes produce small, pale green flowers that are wind-pollinated."
