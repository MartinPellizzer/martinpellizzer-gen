    "intro": "Anactis caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in local ecosystems."
