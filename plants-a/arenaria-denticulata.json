    "intro": "Arenaria denticulata, commonly known as the toothed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria denticulata is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
