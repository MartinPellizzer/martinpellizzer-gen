    "intro": "Angraecum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a yellow lip. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid habitat. It blooms during the dry season, usually between June and August, and relies on specific pollinators like the hawkmoth. Angraecum madagascariense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
