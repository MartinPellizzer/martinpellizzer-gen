    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata var. gracilis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often arranged in a loose, open panicle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its fine texture and adaptability, it is occasionally used in ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
