The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of R\u00e9union. Due to its native habitat, it is often cultivated in similar tropical regions for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon exstipulare was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It was first introduced in the early 19th century and has since been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the country. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It has also been reported in parts of California and the Pacific Northwest, where it has occasionally become naturalized. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
