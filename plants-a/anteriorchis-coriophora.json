It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures that form a dense, crust-like growth on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant's morphology includes small, elongated thallus with a smooth, greenish surface. It typically thrives in humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Anteriorchis coriophora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
