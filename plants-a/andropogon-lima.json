    "intro": "Andropogon lima, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its stiff, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for prairie and woodland environments. Its flowering spikes are usually loose and open, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Andropogon lima plays an important ecological role as a forage plant and in soil stabilization."
