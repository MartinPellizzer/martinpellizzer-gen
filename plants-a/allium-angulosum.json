    "intro": "Allium angulosum, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic or angular leek, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often mistaken for other Allium species, but it can be distinguished by its angular leaf base. Allium angulosum is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
