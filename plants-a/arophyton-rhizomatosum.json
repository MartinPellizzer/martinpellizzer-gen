    "intro": "Arophyton rhizomatosum, commonly known as the creeping root plant, is a perennial herbaceous species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It features slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that produce small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its rapid spread via rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed carefully."
