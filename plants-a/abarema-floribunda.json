    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema floribunda is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Its natural habitat includes moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hillside areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema floribunda was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities, including horticultural trade and landscaping efforts. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is introduced."
