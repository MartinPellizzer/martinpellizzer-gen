    "intro": "Angraecopsis stolzii, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal pollination mechanism by moths make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. Angraecopsis stolzii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
