    "intro": "Ardisia tinifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen ardisia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia tinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
