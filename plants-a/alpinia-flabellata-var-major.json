    "intro": "Alpinia flabellata var. major, commonly known as the giant flame ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or bronze underside. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by vibrant, often red or orange bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
