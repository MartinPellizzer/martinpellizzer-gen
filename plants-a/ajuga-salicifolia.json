    "intro": "Ajuga salicifolia, commonly known as silverroot or broadleaf bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with glossy, dark green foliage that has a distinctive silver-veined appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga salicifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is relatively easy to maintain in garden settings."
