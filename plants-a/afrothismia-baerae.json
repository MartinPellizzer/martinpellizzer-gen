    "intro": "Afrothismia baerae, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained habitats and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
