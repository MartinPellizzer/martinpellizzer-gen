    "intro": "Athyrium dulongicola, commonly known as the Dulong's lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium dulongicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
