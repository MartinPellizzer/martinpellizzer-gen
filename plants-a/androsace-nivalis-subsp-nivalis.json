    "intro": "Androsace nivalis subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It produces dense cushions of foliage that help it withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
