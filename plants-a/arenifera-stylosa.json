    "intro": "Arenifera stylosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species in desert regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenifera stylosa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
