    "intro": "Atriplex fruticosa, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and gray-green foliage with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are succulent and often have a salt-tolerant adaptation, allowing it to thrive in saline soils. Atriplex fruticosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
