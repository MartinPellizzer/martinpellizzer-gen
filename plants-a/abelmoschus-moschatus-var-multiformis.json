    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus var. multiformis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and is commonly found in areas with a monsoonal rainfall pattern. This variant is often associated with wild or semi-wild habitats, such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed soils. It is also known to occur in parts of Africa and the Middle East, though its distribution is less well-documented in these regions. The plant is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus var. multiformis was mainly introduced to new agricultural regions for its potential as a drought-resistant crop. It was brought to these areas to diversify local farming systems and improve food security. The plant's introduction aimed to provide a reliable source of vegetable protein and fiber. Its adaptability to various soil types made it a valuable addition to many ecosystems. However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species."
