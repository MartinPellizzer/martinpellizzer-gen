    "intro": "Amellus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Amellus divaricatus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
