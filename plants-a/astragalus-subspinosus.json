    "intro": "Astragalus subspinosus, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus subspinosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
