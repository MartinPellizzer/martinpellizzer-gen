    "intro": "Avena rupestris var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender oat or filiform oat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
