    "intro": "Agave oteroi, commonly known as the Oteroi agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
