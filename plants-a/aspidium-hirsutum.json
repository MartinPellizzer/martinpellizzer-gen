    "intro": "Aspidium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium hirsutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
