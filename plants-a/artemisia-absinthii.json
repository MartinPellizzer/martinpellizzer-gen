    "intro": "Artemisia absinthii, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains high concentrations of volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its historical use in absinthe, it has garnered significant botanical and cultural interest."
