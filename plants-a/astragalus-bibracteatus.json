    "intro": "Astragalus bibracteatus, commonly known as the two-bracted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Astragalus bibracteatus is also valued for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and wildlife."
