    "intro": "Adiantum cassioides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Adiantum cassioides is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
