    "intro": "Andromeda vacciniifolia, commonly known as the Atlantic rose, is a flowering shrub native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in maritime climates. Andromeda vacciniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions."
