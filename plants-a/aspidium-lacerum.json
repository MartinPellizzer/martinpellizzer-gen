    "intro": "Aspidium lacerum, commonly known as the fringed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Aspidium lacerum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, feathery appearance."
