    "intro": "Atriplex drymarioides, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small greenish or yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Atriplex drymarioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
