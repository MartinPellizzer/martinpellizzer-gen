    "intro": "Agrostis elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Agrostis elmeri is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
