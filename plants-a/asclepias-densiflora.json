    "intro": "Asclepias densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the Asclepias genus, which is used by monarch butterflies for their larval development. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge. Asclepias densiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
