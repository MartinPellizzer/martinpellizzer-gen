    "intro": "Alsophila subobscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
