    "intro": "Alchemilla heteropoda var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are often covered in soft, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in narrow panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in folk medicine for its purported healing properties."
