    "intro": "Austrocylindropuntia floccosa subsp. yanganucensis, commonly known as the Yanganucensis Cactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered with dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its hairy foliage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
