    "intro": "Anaphalis hymenolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, white, cotton-like flowers that are often mistaken for actual cotton, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. Anaphalis hymenolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
