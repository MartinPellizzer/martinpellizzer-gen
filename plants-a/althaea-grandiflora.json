    "intro": "Althaea grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules are a distinctive feature, aiding in wind dispersal. Althaea grandiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
