    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium tenuifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is also native to southern Russia and northern Turkey, where it grows in open meadows and grasslands. It is often associated with limestone-rich environments and can be found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium tenuifolium was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, including roadsides and meadows. This plant has spread across various regions due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in different environmental conditions. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread in parts of Europe, North America, and other temperate regions."
