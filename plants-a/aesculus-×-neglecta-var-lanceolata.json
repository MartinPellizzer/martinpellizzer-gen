    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 neglecta var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf horse chestnut, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces panicles of white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by spiny, velvety fruit capsules containing bright red, shiny seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to urban environments."
