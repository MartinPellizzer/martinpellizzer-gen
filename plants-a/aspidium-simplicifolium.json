    "intro": "Aspidium simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in rows along the veins. Aspidium simplicifolium plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
