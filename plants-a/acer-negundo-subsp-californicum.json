    "intro": "Acer negundo subsp. californicum, commonly known as the California boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands. This subspecies is closely related to the common boxelder but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different leaf structure.",
