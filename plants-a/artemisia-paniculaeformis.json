    "intro": "Artemisia paniculaeformis, commonly known as the panicled artemisia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring silver-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Artemisia paniculaeformis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
