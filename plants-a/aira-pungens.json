    "intro": "Aira pungens, commonly known as the rough air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
