    "intro": "Anthurium tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous flowers that are typically red or orange, surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Anthurium tenuicaule is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
