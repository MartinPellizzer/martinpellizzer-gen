    "intro": "Ayenia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ayenia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ayenia angustifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
