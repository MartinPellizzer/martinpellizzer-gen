    "intro": "Avena agraria, commonly known as the field oat, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stem and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish-brown in color. Avena agraria thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
