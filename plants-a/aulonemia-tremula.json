    "intro": "Aulonemia tremula, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that sway gently in the breeze. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while supporting its growth. Aulonemia tremula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
