It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and is often found near water sources. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
