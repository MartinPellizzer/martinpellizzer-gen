It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has fronds that are divided into smaller, lobed segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Aspidium otophorum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
