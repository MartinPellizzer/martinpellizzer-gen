    "intro": "Azorella nervosa, commonly known as the Andean hair grass, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Azorella nervosa is also known for its ability to form extensive colonies, contributing to the unique ecosystems of the Andes."
