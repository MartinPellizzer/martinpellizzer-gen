    "intro": "Altingia chinensis f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Chinese alder, is a variant of the Chinese alder species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a serrated margin. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
