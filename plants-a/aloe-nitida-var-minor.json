It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically a gray-green color with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container planting."
