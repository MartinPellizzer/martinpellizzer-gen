    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteleia papuana f. minor, commonly known as the Papuan Astelia, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial native to the highlands of New Guinea. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
