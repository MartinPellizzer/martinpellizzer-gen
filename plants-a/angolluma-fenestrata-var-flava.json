    "intro": "Angolluma fenestrata var. flava, commonly known as the golden fenestrated angolluma, is a unique variant of the angolluma genus characterized by its striking yellow foliage. This plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are distinctive for their fenestrated (hollowed-out) patterns, which give it a visually appealing appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
