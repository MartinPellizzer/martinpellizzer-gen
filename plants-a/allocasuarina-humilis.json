    "intro": "Allocasuarina humilis, commonly known as the coastal casuaria, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in fascicles, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Allocasuarina humilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various native species."
