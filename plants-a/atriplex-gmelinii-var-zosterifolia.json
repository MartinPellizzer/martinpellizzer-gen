    "intro": "Atriplex gmelinii var. zosterifolia, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and alternate along the stems, with a distinctive waxy coating. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a tuft of hair. This plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
