    "intro": "Allosorus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican alpine orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its morphology includes a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and narrow, linear leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
