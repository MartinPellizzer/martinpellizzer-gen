    "intro": "Agropyron berezovcanum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
