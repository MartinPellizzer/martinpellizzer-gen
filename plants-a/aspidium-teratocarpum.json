    "intro": "Aspidium teratocarpum, commonly known as the irregular-sheathed water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
