    "intro": "Allium vineale var. purpureum, commonly known as purple garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are often used as a culinary herb, similar to regular garlic. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its distinctive purple tinge in the flower stems adds ornamental value to gardens."
