    "intro": "Aconitum ajanense, commonly known as the Ajanense monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum ajanense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.",
