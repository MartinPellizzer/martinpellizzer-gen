    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum subsp. indicum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, Caroline Is., China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Gilbert Is., Hainan, Howland-Baker Is., India, Jawa, Kazan-retto, Laccadive Is., Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Maldives, Maluku, Marianas, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, Nauru, Nepal, Nicobar Is., Ogasawara-shoto, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Rodrigues, R\u00e9union, South China Sea, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Taiwan, Thailand, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. This species is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, as well as parts of the Indian Ocean and Pacific regions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas, forests, and disturbed habitats. The plant is commonly associated with human-modified landscapes and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its broad native range reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum subsp. indicum was mainly introduced to Brazil North, Chagos Archipelago, Colombia, Comoros, Cuba, Fiji, Haiti, Hawaii, Iraq, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Madeira, Niue, Norfolk Is., Peru, Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Seychelles, Society Is., Trinidad-Tobago, Tubuai Is., Turks-Caicos Is., and Windward Is. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. This species has been reported as an invasive plant in several of these locations, potentially outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as horticulture, accidental seed dispersal, or shipping. The distribution highlights its adaptability to diverse environments across the globe."
