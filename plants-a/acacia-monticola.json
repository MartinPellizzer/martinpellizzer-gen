    "intro": "Acacia monticola, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish to golden flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warm season. Acacia monticola is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its deep root system. It is also notable for its role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia monticola is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Acacia monticola is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low-water environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia monticola was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in areas with poor soil quality where other plants struggle to grow. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects. Its rapid growth and deep root system help stabilize the soil and prevent further degradation. However, its introduction has also led to concerns about potential invasiveness in some regions."
