    "intro": "Agrostis asperifolia, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often covered with short, rough hairs. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct rough texture, contributing to its common name. Agrostis asperifolia is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
