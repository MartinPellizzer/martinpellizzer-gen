    "intro": "Almutaster, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Almutaster thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
