    "intro": "Astragalus handelii, commonly known as the Handel's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Astragalus handelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
