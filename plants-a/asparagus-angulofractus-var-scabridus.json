    "intro": "Asparagus angulofractus var. scabridus, commonly known as the rough-fruited asparagus, is a variant of the asparagus genus characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and compound leaves that are serrated and somewhat rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which develop into dry, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive texture. This variety is native to specific regions in Africa and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
