    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. lusitanicum, commonly known as wild celery, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often growing in moist, disturbed soils. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile compounds like apiol and limonene. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb in certain cuisines."
