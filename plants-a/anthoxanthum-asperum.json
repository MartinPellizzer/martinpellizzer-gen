    "intro": "Anthoxanthum asperum, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a rough texture that gives it its common name. Anthoxanthum asperum is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
