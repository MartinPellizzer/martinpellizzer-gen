    "intro": "Alchemilla lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's Lady's Mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
