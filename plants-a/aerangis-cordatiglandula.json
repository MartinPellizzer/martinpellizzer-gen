It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clustered, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the humid environment. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
