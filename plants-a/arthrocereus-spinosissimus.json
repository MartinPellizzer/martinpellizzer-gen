    "intro": "Arthrocereus spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spiny structure provides protection from herbivores, while its succulent leaves reduce water loss. The plant's unique adaptations make it well-suited for desert and semi-desert environments."
