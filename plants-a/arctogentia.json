    "intro": "Arctogentia, commonly known as the snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of a single species, Arctogentia sinensis, which is native to the mountainous regions of China. The plant is characterized by its deciduous, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to survive in cold, high-altitude environments. Arctogentia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
