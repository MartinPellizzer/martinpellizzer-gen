It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, spiky seed heads. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.
