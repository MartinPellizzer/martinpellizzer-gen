    "intro": "Aleuritopteris subdimorpha, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris subdimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
