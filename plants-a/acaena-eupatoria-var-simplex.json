    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena eupatoria var. simplex is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range. The variety is distinguished by its simple, unbranched stems and small, spiky leaves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena eupatoria var. simplex was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion and reduce sediment runoff. However, it has the potential to become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has been both beneficial for ecological restoration and a concern for native plant communities."
