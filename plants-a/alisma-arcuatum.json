    "intro": "Alisma arcuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats across Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead-shaped base. Its small, white or greenish flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits. Alisma arcuatum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
