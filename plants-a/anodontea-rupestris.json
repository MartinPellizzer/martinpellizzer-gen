    "intro": "Anodontea rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Anodontea rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
