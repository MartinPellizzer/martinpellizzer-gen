    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common restharrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that bear clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is adapted to calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky areas."
