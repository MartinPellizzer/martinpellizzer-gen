    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive spurred petals that are typically blue, purple, or white, arranged in a striking, five-petaled flower. The plant has compound leaves with finely divided lobes, and its stems are upright and often branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The short-styled variant is notable for its reduced nectar spurs, which influence its pollination strategy compared to other Aquilegia species."
