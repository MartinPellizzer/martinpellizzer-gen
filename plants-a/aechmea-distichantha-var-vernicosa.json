    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha var. vernicosa, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The leaves are typically covered in a waxy, velvety coating, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its ability to retain moisture. It produces inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
