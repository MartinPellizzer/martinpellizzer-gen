    "intro": "Acuan oligospermum, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
