    "intro": "Athyrium molle, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies. Athyrium molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
