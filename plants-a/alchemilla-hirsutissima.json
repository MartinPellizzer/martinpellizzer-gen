    "intro": "Alchemilla hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green foliage that resembles a mantle, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla hirsutissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
