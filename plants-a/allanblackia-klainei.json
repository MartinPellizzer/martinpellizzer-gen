    "intro": "Allanblackia klainei, commonly known as African shea or African butter tree, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy berries that contain a rich, creamy seed oil, which is highly valued for its cosmetic and culinary uses. Allanblackia klainei is also noted for its ecological importance, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its economic value and habitat loss, it faces threats of overexploitation and is considered a priority for conservation efforts."
