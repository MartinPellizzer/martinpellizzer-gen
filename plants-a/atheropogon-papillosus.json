    "intro": "Atheropogon papillosus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the leaves and inflorescence, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Atheropogon papillosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
