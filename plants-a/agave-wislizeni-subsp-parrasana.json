It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk bearing clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
