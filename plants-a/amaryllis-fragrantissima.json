    "intro": "Amaryllis fragrantissima, commonly known as the sweet-scented amaryllis, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a subtle, pleasant fragrance. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It blooms during the warmer months, typically in summer, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bulbous root system allows it to thrive in well-draining soil and full sun conditions."
