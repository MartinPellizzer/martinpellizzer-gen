    "intro": "Aeonium glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and can grow up to 15 cm in length. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are arranged in a branched inflorescence. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
