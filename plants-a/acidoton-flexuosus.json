    "intro": "Acidoton flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible acidoton, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
