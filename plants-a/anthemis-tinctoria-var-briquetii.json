    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria var. briquetii, commonly known as the Briquet's tansy, is a variant of the tansy plant native to southern Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous florets arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. The essential oils derived from its leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye."
