    "intro": "Avena tenuis, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, pale flowers. The plant is characterized by its fine, silky texture and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, edible grains that are used in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage crop. Avena tenuis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
