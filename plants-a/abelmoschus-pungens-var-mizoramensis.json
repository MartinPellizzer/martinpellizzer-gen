    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus pungens var. mizoramensis is primarily native to the northeastern region of India, specifically the state of Mizoram. This variant is found in the mountainous areas of this region, where it thrives in humid and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with forested and moist environments, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. The plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of Mizoram, including its rich biodiversity and unique microclimates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus pungens var. mizoramensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in the mountainous areas of northeastern India and adjacent regions of Myanmar. This introduction is primarily due to its unique horticultural value and ornamental appeal. It has been cultivated in home gardens and small-scale farms for its vibrant flowers and edible pods. The plant's distribution has been limited to these areas, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its introduction has also been influenced by local horticultural practices and the interest in cultivating rare and exotic plant species."
