    "intro": "Apatostelis corae, commonly known as the New Zealand flatworm, is a species of flatworm native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Arhegmatobdellidae and is notable for its role in the biological control of the invasive giant African snail. This species lacks a true digestive tract and instead absorbs nutrients through its skin. It is typically found in moist environments such as forests and gardens. The plant-like name may be a misidentification, as it is not a plant but an invertebrate."
