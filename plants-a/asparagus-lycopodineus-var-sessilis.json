    "intro": "Asparagus lycopodineus var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The variety is characterized by its sessile (short-stemmed) leaves, distinguishing it from other asparagus species."
