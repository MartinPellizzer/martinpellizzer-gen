    "intro": "Agrostis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-seeded bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly packed. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in some turfgrass mixes due to its fine texture and resilience."
