It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking winter interest."
