    "intro": "Anepsias moritzianus, commonly known as the Moritz's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
