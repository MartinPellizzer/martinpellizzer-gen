    "intro": "Angraecum saccolabioides, commonly known as the sacred star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and distinctive white, star-shaped flowers with a deep red or purple lip. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in the humid, tropical environments of its native habitat. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by the now-extinct giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
