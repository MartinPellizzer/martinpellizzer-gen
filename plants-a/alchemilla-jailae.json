    "intro": "Alchemilla jailae, commonly known as the Maltese penny-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of Malta. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, silky-hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Alchemilla jailae is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
