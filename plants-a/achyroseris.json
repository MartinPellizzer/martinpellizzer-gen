    "intro": "Achyroseris, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plants typically have hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. Achyroseris species produce yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. These plants are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
