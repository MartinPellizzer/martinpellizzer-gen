    "intro": "Agropyron pouzolzii var. latronum, commonly known as the Armenian grass or Turkish grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in marginal habitats."
