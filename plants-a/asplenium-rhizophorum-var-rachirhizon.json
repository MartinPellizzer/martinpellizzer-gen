It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, clustered fronds. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the bases of trees or rocks in temperate regions. This variant is distinguished by its unique rhizome structure and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
