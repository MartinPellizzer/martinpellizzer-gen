    "intro": "Aristida macrochloa, commonly known as the large-leaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, three-awned spikes that are characteristic of the genus Aristida. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate drought conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
