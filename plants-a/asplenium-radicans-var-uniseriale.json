    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. uniseriale, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often form a dense carpet on rocks or soil. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in humid, low-light habitats."
