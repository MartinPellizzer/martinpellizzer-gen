It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of colors, often including shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive with the right amount of moisture and light. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological significance in Madagascar's biodiversity."
