    "intro": "Asclepias leucophylla, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pointed petals and a distinctive horn-shaped structure called a galea. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae. Asclepias leucophylla thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
