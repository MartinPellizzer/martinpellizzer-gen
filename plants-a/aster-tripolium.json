    "intro": "Aster tripolium, commonly known as sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Aster tripolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in maritime gardens."
