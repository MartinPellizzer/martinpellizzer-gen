    "intro": "Athroisma, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often pink or purple flowers. They typically produce capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Athroisma species are often used in ecological restoration due to their drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils."
