    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five distinct lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
