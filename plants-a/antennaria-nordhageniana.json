    "intro": "Antennaria nordhageniana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Antennaria nordhageniana is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats."
