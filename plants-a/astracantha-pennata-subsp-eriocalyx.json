    "intro": "Astracantha pennata subsp. eriocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces striking yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and involucral bracts that protect the flower heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes cultivated or considered a weed."
