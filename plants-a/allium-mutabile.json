    "intro": "Allium mutabile, commonly known as the variable onion, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, edible bulbs that are often used in cooking, though they can be mildly toxic if consumed in large quantities. Allium mutabile thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
