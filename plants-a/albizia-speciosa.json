    "intro": "Albizia speciosa, commonly known as the silk tree or mimosa tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Albizia speciosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
