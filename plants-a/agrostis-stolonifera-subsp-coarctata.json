    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. This subspecies typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it is adapted to moderate climate conditions. The plant's structure and growth pattern make it a valuable component of ecological and agricultural systems."
