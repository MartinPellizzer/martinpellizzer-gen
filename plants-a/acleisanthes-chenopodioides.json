    "intro": "Acleisanthes chenopodioides, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun.",
