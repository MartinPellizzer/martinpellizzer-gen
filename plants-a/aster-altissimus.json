    "intro": "Aster altissimus, commonly known as the tall aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. Aster altissimus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens and as a wildflower in natural habitats."
