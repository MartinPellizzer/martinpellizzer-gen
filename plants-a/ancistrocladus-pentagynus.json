    "intro": "Ancistrocladus pentagynus, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine despite the plant's toxic properties. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
