    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor or shaded garden settings."
