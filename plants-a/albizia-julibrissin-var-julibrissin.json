    "intro": "Albizia julibrissin var. julibrissin, commonly known as the silk tree or mimosa, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy, fluffy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and root sprouts."
