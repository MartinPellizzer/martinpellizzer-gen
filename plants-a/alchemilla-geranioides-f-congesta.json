    "intro": "Alchemilla geranioides f. congesta, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a compact, low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The plant produces numerous tiny yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. It is well-suited for wet areas and can be used as a ground cover or in bog gardens."
