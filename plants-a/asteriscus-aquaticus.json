    "intro": "Asteriscus aquaticus, commonly known as water aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. It is often found in shallow ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. Asteriscus aquaticus plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations and can be used in wetland restoration projects."
