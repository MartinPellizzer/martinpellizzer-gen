    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, leathery seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind, facilitating its colonization of rocky and alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh, cold climates. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
