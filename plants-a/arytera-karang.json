    "intro": "Arytera karang, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its roots are adapted to tolerate brackish water, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Arytera karang plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life."
