It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-like flowers and slender, herbaceous stems. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its environment, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
