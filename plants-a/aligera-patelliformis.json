    "intro": "Aligera patelliformis, commonly known as the flat-plate alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, disc-like thallus that forms a broad, circular structure. This plant typically grows in shallow, warm coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its structure allows for efficient light absorption, which is crucial for photosynthesis. Aligera patelliformis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
