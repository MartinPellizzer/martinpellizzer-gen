    "intro": "Asplenium lacinulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a finely toothed margin. Asplenium lacinulatum prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest areas."
