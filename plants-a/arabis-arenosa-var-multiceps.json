    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. multiceps, commonly known as the sand arabis, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
