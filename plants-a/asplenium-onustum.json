    "intro": "Asplenium onustum, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the feathers of a maiden's hair, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium onustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
