    "intro": "Assa exotica, commonly known as the Java apple or yellow custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits with a tough, leathery skin. The fruit contains a sweet, creamy pulp that is rich in nutrients and has a unique, custard-like texture. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
