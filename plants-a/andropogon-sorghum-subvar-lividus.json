    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. lividus, commonly known as purpletop sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive violet or purple coloration on the upper parts of its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are usually green or purplish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
