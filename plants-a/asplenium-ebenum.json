    "intro": "Asplenium ebenum, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium ebenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
