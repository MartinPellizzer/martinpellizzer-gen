    "intro": "Adonis jovinienii, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Adonis jovinienii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.",
