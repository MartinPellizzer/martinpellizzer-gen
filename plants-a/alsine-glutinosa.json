    "intro": "Alsine glutinosa, commonly known as sticky alsike, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its sticky leaves and stems are characteristic features that aid in seed dispersal and deter herbivores. Alsine glutinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
