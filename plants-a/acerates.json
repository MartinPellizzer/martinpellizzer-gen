    "intro": "Acerates, commonly known as the maple family, consists of approximately 120 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. These plants are characterized by their opposite leaf arrangement and often striking autumn foliage. Many species produce samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. They are typically found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits. The genus includes well-known species such as Acer saccharum, the sugar maple."
