    "intro": "Astragalus variistipula, commonly known as the variable-bract milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus variistipula plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
