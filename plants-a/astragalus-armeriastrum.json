    "intro": "Astragalus armeriastrum, commonly known as the coastal lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus armeriastrum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
