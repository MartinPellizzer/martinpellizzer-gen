    "intro": "Antidesma tomentosum var. stenocarum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
