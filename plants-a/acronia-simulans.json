It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Acronia simulans is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance.",
