    "intro": "Alsophila media, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat near the base, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Alsophila media is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
