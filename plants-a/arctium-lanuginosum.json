    "intro": "Arctium lanuginosum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that develop into burrs with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
