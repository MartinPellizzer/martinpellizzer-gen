    "intro": "Aspidium cameroonianum, commonly known as the Cameroon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium cameroonianum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
