    "intro": "Aeluropus pungens var. sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of grasses. It is often found in coastal and inland salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
