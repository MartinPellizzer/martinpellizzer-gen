    "intro": "Aechmea hystrix, commonly known as the pineapple plant or Spanish pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a flowering stem that bears numerous small, bell-shaped flowers, followed by bright red berries. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. Aechmea hystrix thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
