    "intro": "Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces flat, clustered inflorescences of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic and anti-inflammatory properties.",
