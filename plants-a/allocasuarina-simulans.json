    "intro": "Allocasuarina simulans, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the twigs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrublands. Allocasuarina simulans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
