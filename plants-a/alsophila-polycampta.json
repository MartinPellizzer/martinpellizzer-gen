    "intro": "Alsophila polycampta, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of tree fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging soils. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
