    "intro": "Astrophytum ornatum, commonly known as the ornate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a solitary, short-stemmed cactus with a distinctive, ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. Astrophytum ornatum is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
