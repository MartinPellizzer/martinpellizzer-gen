    "intro": "Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. latior, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are broader than those of the typical acacia species. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation.",

This subspecies is found in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, where it thrives in sandy soils. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and granite plains. The plant is well adapted to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. latior was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains. It is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change."
