    "intro": "Angraecum spectabile, commonly known as the star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators, particularly the hawkmoth. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollination by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Angraecum spectabile is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
