    "intro": "Aliciella cliffordii, commonly known as the clifford's aliciella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
