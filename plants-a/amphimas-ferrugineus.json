    "intro": "Amphimas ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty amphimas, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The rusty coloration of its stems and leaves is due to the presence of iron oxides, giving it its common name."
