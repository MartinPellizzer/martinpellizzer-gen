It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, woolly leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
