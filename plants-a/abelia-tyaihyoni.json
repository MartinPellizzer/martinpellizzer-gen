This plant grows in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia tyaihyoni was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink and white flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the eastern and southern regions of the country. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in mixed borders, foundation plantings, and as a specimen plant. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness."
