It features broad, strap-like leaves that are often folded or rolled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The botanical name reflects its unique leaf structure, with \"tortifolium\" referring to the twisted or folded leaves."
