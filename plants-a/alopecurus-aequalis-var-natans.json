    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis var. natans, commonly known as floating hairgrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it floats on the water surface. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can affect water flow and aquatic ecosystems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
