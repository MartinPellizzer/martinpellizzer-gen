    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping fir, is a striking variant of the silver fir. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color, with a slightly bluish tinge. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree. This variety is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in optimal conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pendula is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variety is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It thrives in elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. The plant is often associated with mixed forests and is a characteristic component of the alpine vegetation in these regions. Its pendulous branches make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pendula was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique weeping form and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks as a decorative tree. The variety is favored for its ability to thrive in temperate climates with well-drained soil. However, it requires protection from harsh winter conditions to ensure survival. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native range in the Himalayas."
