    "intro": "Aira scabrosetacea, commonly known as the rough-hairy aira, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Aira scabrosetacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
