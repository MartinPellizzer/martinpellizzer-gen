It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anthyllis densifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
