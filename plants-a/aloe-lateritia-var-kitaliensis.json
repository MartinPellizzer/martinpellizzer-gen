    "intro": "Aloe lateritia var. kitaliensis, commonly known as the Kitalien aloe, is a rare and succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
