    "intro": "Anthurium sursumtepalum, commonly known as the upward-pointing spathe anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that typically displays shades of red, orange, or yellow, with a contrasting green spadix in the center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure consists of a modified leaf (spathe) enclosing the true flowers (spadix), which are small and clustered. Anthurium sursumtepalum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add dramatic color to indoor and outdoor gardens."
