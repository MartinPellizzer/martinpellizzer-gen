    "intro": "Arkezostis tibiricae, commonly known as the Tibiric Sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
