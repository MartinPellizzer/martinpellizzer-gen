    "intro": "Anisochilus dysophylloides var. purpureus, commonly known as the purple-leafed anisochilus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that exhibit a vibrant purple hue, especially under full sun exposure. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer, and are often pale green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
