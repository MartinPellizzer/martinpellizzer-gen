    "intro": "Appendicula reflexa f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of the reflexed appendicula, is a variant of the species characterized by its closed, self-fertilizing flowers. This plant belongs to the family Primulaceae and is native to certain regions of Europe. The cleistogamous nature of its flowers means they remain closed throughout their development, facilitating self-pollination. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky areas. The foliage consists of hairy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant."
