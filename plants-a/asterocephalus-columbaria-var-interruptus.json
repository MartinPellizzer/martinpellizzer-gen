    "intro": "Asterocephalus columbaria var. interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted starhead, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually a mix of white and pale yellow, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
