It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and long blooming period."
