    "intro": "Astragalus trichopodus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus trichopodus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
