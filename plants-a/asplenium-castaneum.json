    "intro": "Asplenium castaneum, commonly known as the castaneum spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium castaneum is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
