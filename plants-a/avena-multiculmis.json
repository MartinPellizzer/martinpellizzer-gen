    "intro": "Avena multiculmis, commonly known as the multi-headed oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers in the summer months. Avena multiculmis is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
