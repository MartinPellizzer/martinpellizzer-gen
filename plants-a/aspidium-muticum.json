    "intro": "Aspidium muticum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium muticum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
