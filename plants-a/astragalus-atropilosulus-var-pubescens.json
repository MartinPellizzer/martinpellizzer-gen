    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
