    "intro": "Aspidium tylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Aspidium tylodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
