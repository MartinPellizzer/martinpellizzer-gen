    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. nemorensis, commonly known as the Nemoresis fir, is a rare and relict species native to the northern regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically small and cylindrical, with reddish-brown bracts. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. nemorensis is primarily native to the Russian Far East, specifically the southern and central parts of the Primorsky Krai region. This subspecies is also found in the northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, including parts of North Korea and South Korea. It grows in mountainous regions, typically at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in mixed coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. nemorensis was mainly introduced to North America as part of ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage and cold hardiness. It is primarily cultivated in regions with temperate to subarctic climates, such as the Pacific Northwest and parts of Canada. This subspecies is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely naturalized outside of controlled landscapes."
