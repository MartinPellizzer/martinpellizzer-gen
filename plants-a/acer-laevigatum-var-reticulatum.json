    "intro": "Acer laevigatum var. reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulated maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely veined leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree has a compact, rounded shape with a smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, pendulous flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This ornamental species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
