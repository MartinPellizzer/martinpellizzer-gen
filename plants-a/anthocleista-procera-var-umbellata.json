    "intro": "Anthocleista procera var. umbellata, commonly known as the African star apple or umbellate star apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is consumed fresh or used in local cuisines."
