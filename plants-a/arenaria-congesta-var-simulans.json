It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural use in dry, sunny conditions."
