    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mollissima is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary forests. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and some Pacific islands. Its native range extends into regions with warm climates and abundant rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mollissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions, contributing to its successful establishment. It is now considered a potential weed in some areas, particularly in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
