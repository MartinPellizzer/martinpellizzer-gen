    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum f. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with stout, creeping rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the genus its name. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
