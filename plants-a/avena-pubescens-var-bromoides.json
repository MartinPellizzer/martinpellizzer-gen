It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a dense covering of short hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for use in restoration ecology."
