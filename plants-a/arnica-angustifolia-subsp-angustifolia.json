    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf arnica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its most distinctive feature is its bright yellow flowers, which are composed of many small, tubular florets arranged in a composite head. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
