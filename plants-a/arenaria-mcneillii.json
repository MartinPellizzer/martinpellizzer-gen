    "intro": "Arenaria mcneillii, commonly known as the McNeill's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The species is characterized by its tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils."
