    "intro": "Acrophorus raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water and provides structural support in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Acrophorus raiateensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in Polynesian traditions.",
