    "intro": "Arabis arenosa subsp. borbasii, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
