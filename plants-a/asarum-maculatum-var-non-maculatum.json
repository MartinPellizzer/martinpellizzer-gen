    "intro": "Asarum maculatum var. non-maculatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and a distinct musky aroma. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its lack of the characteristic leaf spots."
