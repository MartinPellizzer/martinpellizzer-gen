It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. Agropyron loliiforme is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
