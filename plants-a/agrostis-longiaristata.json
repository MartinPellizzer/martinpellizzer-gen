    "intro": "Agrostis longiaristata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis longiaristata is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions."
