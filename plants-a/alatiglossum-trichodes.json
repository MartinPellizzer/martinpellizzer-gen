    "intro": "Alatiglossum trichodes, commonly known as the hairy lip plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and showy, lip-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Alatiglossum trichodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
