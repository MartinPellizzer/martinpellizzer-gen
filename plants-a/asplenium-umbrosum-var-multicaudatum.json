    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. multicaudatum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with densely packed, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are clustered near the leaf margins. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
