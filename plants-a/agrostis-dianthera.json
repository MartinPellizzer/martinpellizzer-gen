It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Agrostis dianthera is also valued for its use in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
