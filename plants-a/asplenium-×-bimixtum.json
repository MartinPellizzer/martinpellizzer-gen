    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 bimixtum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a dark green hue and a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it does not produce viable seeds."
