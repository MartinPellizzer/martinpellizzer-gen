    "intro": "Acorus spurius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acorus spurius is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments.",
