    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus f. stejnegeri, commonly known as the alpine silky-grass, is a rare and specialized grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
