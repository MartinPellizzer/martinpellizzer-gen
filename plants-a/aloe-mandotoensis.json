    "intro": "Aloe mandotoensis, commonly known as the Mandoto aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance similar to other aloe species, which may have medicinal properties. Aloe mandotoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-water conditions."
