    "intro": "Angiopteris campsophlebia, commonly known as the Campsophlebia water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, intricate fronds. It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is notable for its primitive features that resemble those of early land plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and its role in understanding the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life."
