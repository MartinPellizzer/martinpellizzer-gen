    "intro": "Agrostis stuebelii, commonly known as Stuebel's bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it stand out in its habitat. Agrostis stuebelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
