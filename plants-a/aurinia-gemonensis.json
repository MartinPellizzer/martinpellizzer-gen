    "intro": "Aurinia gemonensis, commonly known as the Gemonian aurinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is distinguished by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically between May and June. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
