    "intro": "Acacia rhombifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Acacia rhombifolia is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rhombifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Acacia rhombifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rhombifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in semi-arid or arid environments. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for degraded or disturbed lands. The plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, open woodlands, and along roadsides where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for soil stabilization and as a windbreak in agricultural landscapes."
