    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. baldensis, commonly known as the Balkan milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, curved pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows. This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
