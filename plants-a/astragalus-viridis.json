    "intro": "Astragalus viridis, commonly known as green milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Astragalus viridis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
