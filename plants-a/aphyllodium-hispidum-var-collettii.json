    "intro": "Aphyllodium hispidum var. collettii, commonly known as the Collett's feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of tiny, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, textured appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage."
