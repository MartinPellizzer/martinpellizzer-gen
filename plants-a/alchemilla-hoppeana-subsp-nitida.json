    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. nitida, commonly known as the silver-leaved alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
