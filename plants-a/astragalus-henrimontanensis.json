    "intro": "Astragalus henrimontanensis, commonly known as the Henry Mountains milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It has small, compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
