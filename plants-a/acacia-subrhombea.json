    "intro": "Acacia subrhombea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers arranged in compact, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Acacia subrhombea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subrhombea is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia subrhombea is also known for its distinctive thorned appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subrhombea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been planted for ornamental purposes and for its ability to thrive in arid environments. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its classification as a potential weed in some areas. Despite these challenges, it remains a popular choice for landscaping in regions with dry climates."
