    "intro": "Aster lautureanus, commonly known as the Louisiana aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its showy purple to blue flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation programs."
