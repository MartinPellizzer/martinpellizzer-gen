    "intro": "Anacyclus medians, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a small annual herb with a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Anacyclus medians is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
