    "intro": "Arctium arctiodes, commonly known as the purple burdock, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, purple bracts that form the bur-like structures at the top of the plant. These burs contain seeds that are dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing, aiding in the plant's spread."
