    "intro": "Anemone speciosa, commonly known as the showy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers consist of a central cluster of stamens surrounded by petal-like sepals. Anemone speciosa prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
