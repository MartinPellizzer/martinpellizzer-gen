It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
