    "intro": "Acioa sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine acioa, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. Acioa sapinii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
