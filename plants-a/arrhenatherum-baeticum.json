    "intro": "Arrhenatherum baeticum, commonly known as the Iberian meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. This species plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
