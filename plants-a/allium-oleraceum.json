    "intro": "Allium oleraceum, commonly known as field garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, grass-like leaves and purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, white or pale pink bulbs that are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Allium oleraceum is valued both for its culinary uses and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
