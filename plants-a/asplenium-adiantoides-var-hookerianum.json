    "intro": "Asplenium adiantoides var. hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces spores in small, round clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
