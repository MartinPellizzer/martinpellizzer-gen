    "intro": "Arabis araratica, commonly known as the white rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. Arabis araratica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in natural landscapes."
