    "intro": "Aconitum cynoctonum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum cynoctonum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.",
