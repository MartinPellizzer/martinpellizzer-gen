The plant typically produces multiple blooms on a single stalk, with each flower having a distinctive red or orange tip. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting. The foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates."
