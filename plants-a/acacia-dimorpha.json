    "intro": "Acacia dimorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. Acacia dimorpha is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in ecological restoration projects.",

This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia dimorpha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dimorpha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant is now considered an invasive species in some regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
