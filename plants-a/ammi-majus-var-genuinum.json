    "intro": "Ammi majus var. genuinum, commonly known as the lesser cow-wheat, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in fluffy, white pappi, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators."
