    "intro": "Alismorkis tubifera, commonly known as the tubular water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, slender rhizomes that help it anchor in muddy substrates and spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. Small, white flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
