It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that are arranged in a distinctive sub-opposite pattern. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
