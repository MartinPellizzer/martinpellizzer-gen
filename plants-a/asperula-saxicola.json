    "intro": "Asperula saxicola, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
