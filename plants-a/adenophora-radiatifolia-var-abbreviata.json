    "intro": "Adenophora radiatifolia var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often glandular-pubescent, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes.",
