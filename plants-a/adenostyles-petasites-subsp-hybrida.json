It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly leaves and showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its subspecific status reflects its hybrid origin between Adenostyles petasites and other related species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.",
