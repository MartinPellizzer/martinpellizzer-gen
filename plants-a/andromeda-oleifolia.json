It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often covered in a waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky coastal areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
