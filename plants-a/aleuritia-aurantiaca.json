    "intro": "Aleuritia aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-flowered elder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Aleuritia aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and striking fruit display."
