    "intro": "Alectorolophus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine and subalpine environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique lichen-like growth form, which is an adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, forming a dense, mat-like structure that helps it retain moisture. Its narrow, elongated leaves are covered in a layer of fungal hyphae, which is a key feature of its symbiotic relationship with lichens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental changes."
