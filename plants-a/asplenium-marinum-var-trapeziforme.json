It is a small, evergreen fern typically found in rocky coastal areas and shaded, moist habitats. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive trapezoidal outline, contributing to its unique appearance. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rock surfaces. This plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
