    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in harsh environments. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. This species is also used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
