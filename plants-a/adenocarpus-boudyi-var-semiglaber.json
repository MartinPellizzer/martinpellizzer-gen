It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent but less so in this variant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Adenocarpus. This variant is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.",
