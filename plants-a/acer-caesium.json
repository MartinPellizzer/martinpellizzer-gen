    "intro": "Acer caesium, commonly known as the golden maple, is a species of maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed with five to seven segments, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

This species is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested or rocky terrain. The plant is well adapted to the varied elevations and environmental conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for cooler, high-altitude habitats across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caesium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its striking autumn foliage. It was first brought to the continent in the early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking to diversify the landscape with non-native species. The plant has since been planted in gardens and parks across the eastern United States. However, it has not become invasive and is generally considered a non-native but non-invasive species. Its introduction has primarily been for aesthetic purposes rather than ecological or agricultural use."
