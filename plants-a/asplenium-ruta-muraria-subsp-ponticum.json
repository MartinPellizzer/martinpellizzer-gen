    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp. ponticum, commonly known as the Mediterranean spleenwort, is a fern species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are characteristic of the Aspleniaceae family. This subspecies is often found in rocky or calcareous substrates and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
