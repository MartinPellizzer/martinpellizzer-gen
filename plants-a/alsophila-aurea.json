    "intro": "Alsophila aurea, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a smooth, glossy surface, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Alsophila aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also found in moist, shaded forest environments."
