This variant is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant is often associated with mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax trifoliatus var. setosus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It is commonly distributed in parts of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. This variant is known for its distinctive three-leaved foliage and thorny stems, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction to new regions may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive."
