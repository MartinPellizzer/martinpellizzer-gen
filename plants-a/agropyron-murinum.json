    "intro": "Agropyron murinum, commonly known as the mouse barley or goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. Agropyron murinum is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
