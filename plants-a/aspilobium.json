    "intro": "Aspilobium, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species that are often used in ornamental horticulture for their attractive, feathery foliage. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky environments and are adapted to arid conditions. Aspilobium species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in dense clusters. They are valued for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
