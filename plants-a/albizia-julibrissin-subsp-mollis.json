It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability."
