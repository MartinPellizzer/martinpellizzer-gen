    "intro": "Afromendoncia floribunda, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the wet season. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and rarity in the wild, it is highly valued in horticultural circles."
