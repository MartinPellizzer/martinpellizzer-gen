    "intro": "Astragalus shadiensis, commonly known as the Shadensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with pinnately compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Astragalus shadiensis is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
