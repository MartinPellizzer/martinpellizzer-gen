    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. halepensis, commonly known as tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale pink. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common species in coastal and inland areas with poor soil. Its roots can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, and it is often used for erosion control. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
