    "intro": "Astragalus linearifolius, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with linear leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments. Astragalus linearifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
