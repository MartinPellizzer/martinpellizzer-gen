    "intro": "Angophora floribunda, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy underside. Angophora floribunda is typically found in coastal and wetland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
