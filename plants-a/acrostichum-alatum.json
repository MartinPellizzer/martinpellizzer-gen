    "intro": "Acrostichum alatum, commonly known as the broadleaf brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's unique structure and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.",
