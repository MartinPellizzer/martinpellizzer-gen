    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. nova, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellowish-green flowering heads. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its essential oils, particularly camphor and thujone, contribute to its strong, distinctive odor. This subspecies is important in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
