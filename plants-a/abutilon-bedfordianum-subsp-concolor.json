It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils in regions such as the Chihuahuan Desert. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky outcrops and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum subsp. concolor was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this subspecies is primarily limited to the North Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread readily."
