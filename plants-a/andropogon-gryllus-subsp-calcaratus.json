    "intro": "Andropogon gryllus subsp. calcaratus, commonly known as the sand bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, clump-like growths. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils, making it well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
