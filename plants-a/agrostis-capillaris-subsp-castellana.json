It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
