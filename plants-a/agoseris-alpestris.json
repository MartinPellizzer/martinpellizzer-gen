    "intro": "Agoseris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine goldenroot, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agoseris alpestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and tonic properties."
