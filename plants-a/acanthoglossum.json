    "intro": "Acanthoglossum, commonly known as the horse-tail plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that resemble the bristles of a horse's tail, giving it its common name. These plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Acanthoglossum species are perennial herbs with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
