    "intro": "Apera maritima, commonly known as sea grass or sea oat, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Apera maritima thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
