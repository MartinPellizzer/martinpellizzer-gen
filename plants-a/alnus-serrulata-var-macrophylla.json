    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This species plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
