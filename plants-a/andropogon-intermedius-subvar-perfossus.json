    "intro": "Andropogon intermedius subvar. perfossus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in restoration projects. The species is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and is often used as a forage plant for livestock."
