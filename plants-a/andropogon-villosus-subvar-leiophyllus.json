    "intro": "Andropogon villosus subvar. leiophyllus, commonly known as silky grass or silky bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. This perennial grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
