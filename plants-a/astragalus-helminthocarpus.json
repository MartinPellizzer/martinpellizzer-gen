    "intro": "Astragalus helminthocarpus, commonly known as the threadpod milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated pods that are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus helminthocarpus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various insects and wildlife."
