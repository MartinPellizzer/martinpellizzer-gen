    "intro": "Arabis pendula var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous pendulous rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous racemes of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and have a rough texture. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Arabis pendula."
