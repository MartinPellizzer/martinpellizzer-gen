    "intro": "Aegilops biaristata, commonly known as the two-rowed wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-rowed glumes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into hard, straw-colored grains. It is closely related to domesticated wheat and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement. Aegilops biaristata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat breeding programs."
