    "intro": "Afrardisia dentata, commonly known as the African toothed fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. Native to tropical Africa, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its delicate structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
