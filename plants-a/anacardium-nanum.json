    "intro": "Anacardium nanum, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by bees. The tree produces woody capsules that contain multiple edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
