    "intro": "Aerangis karthalensis, commonly known as the Karthala orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, adapting to the humid and tropical climate of its native habitat. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in crevices, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis karthalensis is considered a vulnerable species."
