    "intro": "Aconitum tatsienense, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and southwestern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. Aconitum tatsienense is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a highly poisonous species, though it is also valued in traditional medicine. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine flora.",
