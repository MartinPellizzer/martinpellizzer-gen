It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for ground cover.",
