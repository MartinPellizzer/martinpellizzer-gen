    "intro": "Agrostophyllum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Dipterocarpaceae family, in tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
