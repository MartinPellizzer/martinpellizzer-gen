    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. semisecta, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
