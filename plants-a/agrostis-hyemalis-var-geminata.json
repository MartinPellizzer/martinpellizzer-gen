    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis var. geminata, commonly known as winter bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically light to medium green in color. This variety is known for its ability to form dense, mat-like growth, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers."
