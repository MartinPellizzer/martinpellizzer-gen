    "intro": "Anthericum liliastrum, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to both lilies and wood sorrel, highlighting its unique floral and foliage characteristics."
