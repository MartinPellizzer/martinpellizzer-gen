    "intro": "Asplenium listeri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium listeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
