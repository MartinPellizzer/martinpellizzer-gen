    "intro": "Arrhenechthites tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly alpine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly texture and a pale to grayish-green coloration. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces and soil in alpine and subalpine regions. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates with limited nutrients."
