    "intro": "Alphitonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved alphitonia, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and inland tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy, orange-colored fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Alphitonia macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Indigenous Australian practices."
