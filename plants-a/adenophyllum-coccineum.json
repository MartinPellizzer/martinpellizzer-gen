    "intro": "Adenophyllum coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically borne on tall, sturdy stems that rise above the foliage. Adenophyllum coccineum is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.",
