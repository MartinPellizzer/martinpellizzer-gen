    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It is well adapted to shady conditions and can tolerate moderate foot traffic, making it a common component of natural grasslands. Its ecological value lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
