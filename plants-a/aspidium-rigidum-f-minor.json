    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum f. minor, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, dense fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced along the rachis. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
