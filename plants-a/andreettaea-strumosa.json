    "intro": "Andreettaea strumosa, commonly known as the Brazilian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
