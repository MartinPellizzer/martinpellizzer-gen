    "intro": "Arenaria blepharophylla var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It is well adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
