    "intro": "Argentina borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean argentine fern, is a rare species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
