    "intro": "Acer machilifolium, commonly known as the red maple or mapleleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Acer machilifolium is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide seasonal color.",
