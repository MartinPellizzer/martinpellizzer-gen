    "intro": "Acaena pectinata, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, characterized by its dense, thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. Acaena pectinata plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing food for various birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pectinata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the lower and upper regions of the Southland and Otago areas. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and inland environments where the climate is temperate. Acaena pectinata plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pectinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant is now considered an invasive species in several regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has led to ecological concerns due to its ability to form dense stands."
