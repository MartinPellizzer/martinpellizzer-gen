    "intro": "Anthoxanthum hirtum subsp. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Anthoxanthum hirtum subsp. arcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra and mountain ecosystems."
