    "intro": "Aleuritopteris scioana, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns. Aleuritopteris scioana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
