    "intro": "Aithales cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in open meadows and slopes. Aithales cespitosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
