    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca domingensis var. latifolia is primarily native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. This plant is commonly found in the Andean foothills and surrounding areas where the climate is temperate with distinct wet and dry seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and dry forests. The species is also known to grow in coastal areas, where it can tolerate mild salt exposure. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca domingensis var. latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production. It was likely brought in during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists interested in exotic species. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in natural environments across the country. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
