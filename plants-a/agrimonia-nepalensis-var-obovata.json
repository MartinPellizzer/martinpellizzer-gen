    "intro": "Agrimonia nepalensis var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf agrimony, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Agrimony is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
