It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded woodland settings."
