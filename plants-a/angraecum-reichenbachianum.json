    "intro": "Angraecum reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive star-like shape, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence with many small, fragrant blooms, which are adapted to attract specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
