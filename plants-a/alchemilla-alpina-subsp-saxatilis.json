    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Alchemilla alpina subsp. saxatilis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
