    "intro": "Aphelandra scabra, commonly known as the velvetleaf torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra scabra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
