    "intro": "Arenaria katoana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are linear and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine plantings. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, contributing to its popularity among gardeners in temperate climates."
