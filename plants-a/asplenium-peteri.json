    "intro": "Asplenium peteri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Asplenium peteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
