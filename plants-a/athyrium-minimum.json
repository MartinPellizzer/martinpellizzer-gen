    "intro": "Athyrium minimum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a small evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a bright green color and a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Athyrium minimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ornamental gardening and as a houseplant."
