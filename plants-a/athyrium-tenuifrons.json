    "intro": "Athyrium tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Athyrium tenuifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
