It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus kusnezovii is often found in alpine and steppe ecosystems, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
