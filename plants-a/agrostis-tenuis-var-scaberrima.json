    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. scaberrima, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
