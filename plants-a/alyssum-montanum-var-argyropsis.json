    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. argyropsis, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features compact, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
