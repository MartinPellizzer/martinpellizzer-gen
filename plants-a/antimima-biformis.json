    "intro": "Antimima biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed antimony plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and has a preference for sunny to partially shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Antimima biformis is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
