    "intro": "Avena fatua var. mollis, commonly known as slender oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its more delicate and compact growth habit. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets that are usually green or brown in color. It is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and can thrive in both temperate and colder climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in agricultural areas where it competes with cultivated crops."
