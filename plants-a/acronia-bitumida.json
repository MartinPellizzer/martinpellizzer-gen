It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its stems are covered in a sticky, rubbery substance, which gives it its common name. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.",
