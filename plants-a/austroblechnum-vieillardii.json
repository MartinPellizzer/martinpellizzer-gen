    "intro": "Austroblechnum vieillardii, commonly known as the Victoria fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
