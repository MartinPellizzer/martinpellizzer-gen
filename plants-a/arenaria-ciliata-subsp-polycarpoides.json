    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. polycarpoides, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and dry meadows. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in stabilizing sandy soils."
