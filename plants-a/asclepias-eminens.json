    "intro": "Asclepias eminens, commonly known as the tall milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias eminens is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for its defense mechanisms."
