    "intro": "Aleuritopteris farinosa, commonly known as the fern moss or farinose water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aleuritopteris farinosa plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
