    "intro": "Acetosella acutifolia, commonly known as sharp-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive acuminate tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Acetosella acutifolia is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
