    "intro": "Adenanthera tetraptera, commonly known as the African burr or wild burr, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its seeds are encased in a thick, woody shell that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments.",
