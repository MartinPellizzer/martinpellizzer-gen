    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 silesiaca var. vulgaris, commonly known as the European alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its small, catkin-like flowers and alternate, simple leaves. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays an important role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. This species is valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
