    "intro": "Adiantum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
