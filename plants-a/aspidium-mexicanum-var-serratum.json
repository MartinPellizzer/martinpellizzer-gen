    "intro": "Aspidium mexicanum var. serratum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
