    "intro": "Anthemis montana subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
