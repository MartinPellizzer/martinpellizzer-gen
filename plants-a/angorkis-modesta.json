    "intro": "Angorkis modesta, commonly known as the modest angorkis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, indicating its adaptation to arid environments. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
