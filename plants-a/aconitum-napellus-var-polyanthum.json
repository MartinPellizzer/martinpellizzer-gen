It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to purple spires of tubular flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a coarse texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
