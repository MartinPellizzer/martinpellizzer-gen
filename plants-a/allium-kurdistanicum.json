    "intro": "Allium kurdistanicum, commonly known as the Kurdish leek, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, spherical bulbils along the stem, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential culinary uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
