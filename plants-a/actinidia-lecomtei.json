It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, fuzzy fruits. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to the common kiwifruit but are less commercially cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper fruit development. The species is valued for its ornamental value and potential as a fruit crop.",
