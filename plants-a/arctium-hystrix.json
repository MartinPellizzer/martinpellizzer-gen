    "intro": "Arctium hystrix, commonly known as the burdock plant, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to brown flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which give it its distinctive bur-like appearance. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Arctium hystrix is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
