It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments at moderate elevations. The plant is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. Its restricted distribution highlights its ecological significance and vulnerability to habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ankaranensis was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is native to Southeast Asia and was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species in Madagascar is limited to specific regions, primarily in the eastern part of the island. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is considered a rare species in its new environment."
