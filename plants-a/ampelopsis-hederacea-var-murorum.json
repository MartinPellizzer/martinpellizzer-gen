    "intro": "Ampelopsis hederacea var. murorum, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a vigorous trailing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
