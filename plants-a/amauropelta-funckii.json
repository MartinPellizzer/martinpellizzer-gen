    "intro": "Amauropelta funckii, commonly known as the Funck's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen, which helps in identifying the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta funckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
