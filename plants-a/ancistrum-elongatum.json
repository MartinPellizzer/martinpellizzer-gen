    "intro": "Ancistrum elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowroot plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, warm environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. Its leaves are large, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy surface, while its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Ancistrum elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and traditional medicinal purposes."
