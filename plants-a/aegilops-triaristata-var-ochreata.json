    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata var. ochreata, commonly known as the ochre wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are often pale green to yellowish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
