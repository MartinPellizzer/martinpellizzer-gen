    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum var. exsertum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
