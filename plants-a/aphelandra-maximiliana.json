    "intro": "Aphelandra maximiliana, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble torches, with bright yellow bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aphelandra maximiliana is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its preference for indirect light and consistent moisture."
