    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne var. orientale, commonly known as the Oriental star cactus, is a succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, ribbed stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pale green, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a compact, globular shape that makes it well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation. It requires full sun and well-draining soil to thrive."
