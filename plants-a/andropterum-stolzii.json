    "intro": "Andropterum stolzii, commonly known as the African moonseed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
