    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. elata, commonly known as tall bentgrass, is a variant of bentgrass characterized by its upright growth habit and taller stature compared to the standard variety. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically inconspicuous. It is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh, coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate drought and salt makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and coastal vegetation."
