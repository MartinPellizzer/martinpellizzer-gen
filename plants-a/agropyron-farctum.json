    "intro": "Agropyron farctum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often bristly and can be found in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas. Agropyron farctum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage production."
