    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 dolosum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore cases called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on spore dispersal for propagation."
