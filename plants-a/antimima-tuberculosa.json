    "intro": "Antimima tuberculosa, commonly known as the tubercled antplant, is a unique species native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ability to grow on tree trunks, forming a dense, mat-like structure. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, fragrant white flowers. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of tubercles, or small bumps, on its stems and leaves. Antimima tuberculosa plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for various invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
