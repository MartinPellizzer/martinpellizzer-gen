    "intro": "Angraecum pescatorianum, commonly known as the fishing boat orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
