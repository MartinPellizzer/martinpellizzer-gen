    "intro": "Anemone polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and basal leaves that are palmately lobed with hairy surfaces. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Anemone polycarpa thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
