    "intro": "Asemeia echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-seeded asemeia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny, woody capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. Asemeia echinosperma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
