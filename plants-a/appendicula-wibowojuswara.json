    "intro": "Appendicula wibowojuswara, commonly known as the Wibowo's appendicula, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests where humidity is high. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
