    "intro": "Asplenium hastatum var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a fragrant, glandular coating. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rocks or soil, preferring humid and cool environments. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its subtle, pleasant aroma, which is more pronounced in certain environmental conditions."
