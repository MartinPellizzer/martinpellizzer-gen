    "intro": "Antodon, commonly known as the antler fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Davalliaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, antler-like fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-shaped segments. Antodons are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The genus includes several species, each with unique variations in frond morphology and habitat preferences."
