    "intro": "Anisochilus suffruticosus, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
