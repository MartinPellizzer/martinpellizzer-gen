It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow.

They have thick, fleshy leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Apocynaceae family."
