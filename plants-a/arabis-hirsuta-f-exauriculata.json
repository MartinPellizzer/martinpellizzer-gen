It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
