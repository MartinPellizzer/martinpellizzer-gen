    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata var. genuina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. It prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to high levels of sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains concentrated in Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and gardeners. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the warm, humid conditions of these regions. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its role as an invasive species in certain parts of its range."
