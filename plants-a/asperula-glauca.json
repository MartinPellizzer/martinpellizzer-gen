    "intro": "Asperula glauca, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Asperula glauca thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
