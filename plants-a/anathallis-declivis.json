    "intro": "Anathallis declivis, commonly known as the cliff anathallis, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple inflorescence. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it forms dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other small insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
