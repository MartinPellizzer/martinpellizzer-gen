    "intro": "Acantholimon huetii, commonly known as the Huet's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern France and northern Spain. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon huetii is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in the region of Turkey, specifically in the southern and eastern parts of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Turkey where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon huetii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and flowering habits. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Italy. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established itself in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various climates within its introduced range. Its distribution has been documented in several regions, though it remains primarily confined to human-modified environments."
