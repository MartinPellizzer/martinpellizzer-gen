    "intro": "Agrostis castellana var. mixta, commonly known as the mixed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
