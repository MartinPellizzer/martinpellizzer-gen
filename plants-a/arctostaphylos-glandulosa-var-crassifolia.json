    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pink during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and mild, wet winters."
