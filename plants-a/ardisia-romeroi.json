It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds.

Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
