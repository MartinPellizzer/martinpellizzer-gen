    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. oligantha, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a compact, mat-forming perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its low-growing nature and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
