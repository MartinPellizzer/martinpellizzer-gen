    "intro": "Acinos suaveolens subsp. kalampacanus, commonly known as the Kalampaca mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
