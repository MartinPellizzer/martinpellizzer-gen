    "intro": "Aglaia tamilnadensis, commonly known as the Tamil Nadu aglaia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly India. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its timber and ornamental features."
