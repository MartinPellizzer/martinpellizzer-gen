    "intro": "Acaena sarmentosa, commonly known as the trailing acaena, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit with numerous stolons. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, hairy achene, which is adapted for wind dispersal. Acaena sarmentosa is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

It thrives in the region's temperate climate and rocky coastal habitats. Acaena sarmentosa is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the island. It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of Tristan da Cunha.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sarmentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in various regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly persistent in disturbed areas. Its spread has led to concerns over its ecological impact on local ecosystems."
