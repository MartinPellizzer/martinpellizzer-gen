    "intro": "Amphistelma graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaf tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a shrub with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, which contributes to its common name. Amphistelma graminifolium is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
