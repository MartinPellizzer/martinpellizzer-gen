    "intro": "Allocasuarina lehmanniana subsp. lehmanniana, commonly known as the lemon wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique needle-like phyllodes, which are typically yellow-green in color and arranged in spiral clusters around the stem. The plant produces small, red, spherical flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes, followed by woody, elongated seed pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
