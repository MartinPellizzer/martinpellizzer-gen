    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the blue poplar, is a rare and striking member of the maple family native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which contrasts sharply with its bright green stems and bark. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
