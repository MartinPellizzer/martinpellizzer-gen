    "intro": "Asparagus oliveri, commonly known as the Canary Island asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features slender, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Asparagus oliveri is adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
