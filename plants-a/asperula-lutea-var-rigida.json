It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fragrant, small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation. Its botanical features make it a valued plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
