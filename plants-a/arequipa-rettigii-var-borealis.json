It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying shades of white and pale blue. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
