    "intro": "Astragalus arnoldi, commonly known as Arnold's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus arnoldi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
