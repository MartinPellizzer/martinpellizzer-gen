    "intro": "Abies finhonnoskiana, commonly known as the Far Eastern fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cone structures. The tree typically grows in cool, moist climates at high altitudes. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies finhonnoskiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia, specifically the Sikhote-Alin Mountains. This species grows in the temperate coniferous forests at high elevations. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh winters of its native habitat. It is a rare and endemic species found only in this specific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies finhonnoskiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is often planted for its ornamental value, including its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and biodiversity."
