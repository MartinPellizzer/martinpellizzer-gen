    "intro": "Aira tenuissima, commonly known as slender airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
