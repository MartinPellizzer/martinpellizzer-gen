    "intro": "Antidesma erythroxyloides, commonly known as the red-leaf antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
