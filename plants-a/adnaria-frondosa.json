It belongs to the family Cymodoceae and is characterized by its branching structure and fleshy, leaf-like structures. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it adapts to fluctuating salinity and wave action. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water currents. Adnaria frondosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.",
