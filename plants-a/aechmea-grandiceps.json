    "intro": "Aechmea grandiceps, commonly known as the pink pineapple or the red torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a vibrant green to reddish hue, depending on the variety. It produces an inflorescence that can range from pink to red, with showy bracts that add to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
