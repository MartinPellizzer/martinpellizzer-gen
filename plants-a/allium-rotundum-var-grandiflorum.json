    "intro": "Allium rotundum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Persian leek or great globe garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features rounded, bulbous stems that are often mistaken for onions due to their similar appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hollow, grass-like, and have a mild garlic scent, while the bulbs are used in various culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its aromatic, edible qualities."
