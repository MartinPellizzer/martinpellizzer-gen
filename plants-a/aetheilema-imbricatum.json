    "intro": "Aetheilema imbricatum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
