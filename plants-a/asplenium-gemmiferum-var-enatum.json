    "intro": "Asplenium gemmiferum var. enatum, commonly known as the spurred spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered in dense, compact rosettes. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or damp woodlands. This variety is distinguished by its unique spurred structures on the fertile fronds, which aid in spore dispersal."
