    "intro": "Ardisia campanensis, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible when ripe but contain small seeds and are often consumed by birds and mammals. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and as a hedge."
