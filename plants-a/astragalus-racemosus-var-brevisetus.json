    "intro": "Astragalus racemosus var. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branched stems and produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
