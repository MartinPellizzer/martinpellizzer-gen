    "intro": "Amellus strigosus subsp. scabridus, commonly known as the rough amellus, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. This subspecies is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
