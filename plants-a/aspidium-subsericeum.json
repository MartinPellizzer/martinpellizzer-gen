    "intro": "Aspidium subsericeum, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered with a fine, silky layer of hair, contributing to its common name. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and venation patterns."
