It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes most grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
