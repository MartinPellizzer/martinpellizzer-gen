    "intro": "Agrostis pyrogea var. mutica, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
