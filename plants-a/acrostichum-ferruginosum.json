    "intro": "Acrostichum ferruginosum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or reddish-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance.",
