    "intro": "Acacia hova, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, feathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia hova is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical regions. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hova is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in various regions across the island, particularly in dry and semi-arid areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Acacia hova is also known for its distinctive appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hova was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been largely for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber. However, it has also raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
