    "intro": "Artemisia millefoliata, commonly known as common tarragon, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent, which comes from volatile oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. This species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
