    "intro": "Aster halophilus, commonly known as the saltmeadow aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating a high tolerance for saltwater and soil salinity. The plant produces showy purple or white flowers in the late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Aster halophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
