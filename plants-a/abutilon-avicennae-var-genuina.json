    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. genuina is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, including countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like forests, grasslands, and riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas due to its adaptability. Its native range extends into parts of Central America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The introduction occurred primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has since become naturalized in some areas, particularly in moist, disturbed habitats. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
