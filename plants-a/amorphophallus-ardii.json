    "intro": "Amorphophallus ardii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-shaped inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a unique, pungent odor reminiscent of rotting meat, which attracts carrion flies for pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Amorphophallus ardii is also valued for its edible corm, which is used in traditional cuisines."
