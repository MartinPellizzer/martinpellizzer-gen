This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert environments. The species is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon incanum was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native plants. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in Hawaii."
