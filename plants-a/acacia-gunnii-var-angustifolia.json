    "intro": "Acacia gunnii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It features slender, angular stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gunnii var. angustifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variety is commonly found in rocky outcrops, gravelly soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant is often part of the local vegetation in shrublands and woodlands. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gunnii var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader acacia introduction program in the 19th century. This variety is known for its narrow leaves and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, its spread is limited compared to other introduced acacia species."
