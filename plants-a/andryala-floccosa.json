    "intro": "Andryala floccosa, commonly known as the fluffcap, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves that help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andryala floccosa is considered a vulnerable species."
