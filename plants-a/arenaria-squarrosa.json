    "intro": "Arenaria squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitats."
