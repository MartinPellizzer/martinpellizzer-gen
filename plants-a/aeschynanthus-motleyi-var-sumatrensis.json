    "intro": "Aeschynanthus motleyi var. sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran flame vine, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shaded garden areas."
