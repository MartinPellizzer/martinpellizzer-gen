It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, dark red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense thickets."
