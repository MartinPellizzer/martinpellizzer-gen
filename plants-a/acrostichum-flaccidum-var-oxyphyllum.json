    "intro": "Acrostichum flaccidum var. oxyphyllum, commonly known as the oxyphyll acrostichum, is a variant of the common brake fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green with a leathery texture and have a distinctive, waxy coating. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.",
