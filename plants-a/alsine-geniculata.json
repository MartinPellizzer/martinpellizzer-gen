    "intro": "Alsine geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with a distinctive zigzagging stem that helps it withstand wind and sand. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Alsine geniculata is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in dunes, roadsides, and other dry, sandy environments."
