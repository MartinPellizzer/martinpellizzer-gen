    "intro": "Astragalus hedgei, commonly known as the hedgehog milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Astragalus hedgei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
