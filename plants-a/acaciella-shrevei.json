    "intro": "Acaciella shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve's acaciella, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features include the presence of nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella shrevei is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes, limestone outcrops, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of these regions. It is often seen growing in association with other drought-tolerant species. Due to its limited range, Acaciella shrevei is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella shrevei was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It has also been found in parts of Arizona and southern California. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along fences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes."
