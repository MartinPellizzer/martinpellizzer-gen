    "intro": "Anredera filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features slender, vine-like stems that can climb or trail, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often described as thread-like, which gives the plant its common name. Anredera filiformis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
