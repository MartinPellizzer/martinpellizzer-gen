    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. pungens, commonly known as the spiked oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescence composed of dense clusters of bracts. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in spikelets that are often used as forage for livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. The variety pungens is distinguished by its sharp, bristly awns, which give it its common name."
