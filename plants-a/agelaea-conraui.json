    "intro": "Agelaea conraui, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that often display a mix of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, and it produces small, clustered blooms that bloom sporadically. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Agelaea conraui is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
