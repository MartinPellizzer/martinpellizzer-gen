    "intro": "Aconitum richardsonianum, commonly known as the Richardson's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum richardsonianum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
