    "intro": "Adiantum conglomeratum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum conglomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
