    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. hirtella, commonly known as hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes that bloom above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness."
