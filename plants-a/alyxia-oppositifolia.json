    "intro": "Alyxia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. Alyxia oppositifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
