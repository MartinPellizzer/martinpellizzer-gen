    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. exaristata, commonly known as the bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
