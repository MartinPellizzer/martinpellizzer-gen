    "intro": "Acer thomsonii subsp. catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaf maple, is a rare and unique maple species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of catalpa trees, featuring large, heart-shaped lobes with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
