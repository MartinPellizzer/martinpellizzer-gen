    "intro": "Adicea chrysosplenioides, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, clustered leaves that are pinnately divided. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adicea chrysosplenioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates.",
