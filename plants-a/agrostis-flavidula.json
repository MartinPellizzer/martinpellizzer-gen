    "intro": "Agrostis flavidula, commonly known as yellow meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or silver on the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis flavidula is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
