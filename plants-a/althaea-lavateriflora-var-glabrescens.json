    "intro": "Althaea lavateriflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth marshmallow plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stem compared to the more commonly known Althaea officinalis."
