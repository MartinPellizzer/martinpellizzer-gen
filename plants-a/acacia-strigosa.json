    "intro": "Acacia strigosa, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are small, narrow, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia strigosa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia strigosa is primarily native to Australia, specifically the southeastern and southwestern regions. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodland areas. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It is often seen in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia and South Australia. Acacia strigosa is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia strigosa was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various regions across the continent. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive tendencies require careful management to prevent ecological harm."
