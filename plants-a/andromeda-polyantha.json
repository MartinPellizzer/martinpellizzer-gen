    "intro": "Andromeda polyantha, commonly known as the snow laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, coastal woodland habitats. Andromeda polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
