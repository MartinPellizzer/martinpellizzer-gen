    "intro": "Andrachne tenera, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Andrachne tenera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
