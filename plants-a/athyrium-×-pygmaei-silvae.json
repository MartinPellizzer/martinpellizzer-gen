    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 pygmaei-silvae, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Athyrium filipendulineum and Athyrium silvaticum. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow no taller than a few inches, making it ideal for small garden spaces or terrariums. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid conditions with well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in horticulture."
