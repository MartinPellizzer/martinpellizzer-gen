    "intro": "Acer italum var. reygassei, commonly known as the Reygassei maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Italian maple. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and unique foliage, it is a prized specimen among horticulturists and botanists.",
