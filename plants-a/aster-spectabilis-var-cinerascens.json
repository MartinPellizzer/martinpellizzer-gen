It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender-colored flowers that appear in late summer and early fall. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.
