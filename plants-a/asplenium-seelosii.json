    "intro": "Asplenium seelosii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. Asplenium seelosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
