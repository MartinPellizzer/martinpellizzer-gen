    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. circinatum, commonly known as the twisted aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
