    "intro": "Ammannia urceolata, commonly known as the bladderleaf ammannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
