    "intro": "Arctium alatum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple flowers in clustered heads, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that cling to animals and clothing. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium alatum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in fields."
