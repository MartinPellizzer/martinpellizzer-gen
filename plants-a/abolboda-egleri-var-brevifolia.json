    "intro": "Abolboda egleri var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved form of the genus Abolboda, is a rare and specialized plant species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to the typical species. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, elliptical leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species.",

It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these two South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda egleri var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is known for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Due to its hardiness, it has been widely adopted in horticultural practices across Europe and parts of North America."
