    "intro": "Appendiculopsis lateralis, commonly known as the laterally appendaged liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus with lateral appendages that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including antheridiodes and archegoniata, are located on the thallus surface. Appendiculopsis lateralis plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
