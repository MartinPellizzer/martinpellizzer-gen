    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as silky sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
