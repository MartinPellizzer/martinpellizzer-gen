    "intro": "Anthericum subtrigynum, commonly known as the lesser marsh-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. Anthericum subtrigynum is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of such habitats."
