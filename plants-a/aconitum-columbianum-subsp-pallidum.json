    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum subsp. pallidum, commonly known as the Pacific woad, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.",
