    "intro": "Arabis alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
