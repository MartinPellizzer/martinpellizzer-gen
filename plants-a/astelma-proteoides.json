    "intro": "Astelma proteoides, commonly known as the Protea of the Cape, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils due to its association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water conservation. Astelma proteoides is also notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and birds."
