    "intro": "Acalypha stipularis, commonly known as the stipe-leaved spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often spiny plants. The plant is characterized by its unique, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are used to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough texture, while the stems are often hairy. Acalypha stipularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking foliage and inflorescences.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha stipularis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines and New Guinea. Its distribution extends into some regions of northern Australia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stipularis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction highlights the unintended ecological consequences of bringing non-native species to new environments."
