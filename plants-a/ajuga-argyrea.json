    "intro": "Ajuga argyrea, commonly known as silver root or silver bugloss, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it a persistent ground cover. Ajuga argyrea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
