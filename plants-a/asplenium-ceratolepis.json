    "intro": "Asplenium ceratolepis, commonly known as the horned spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are often protected by a waxy coating. Asplenium ceratolepis is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
