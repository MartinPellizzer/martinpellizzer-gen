    "intro": "Apetahia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant with striking botanical features. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink petals that bloom on long, floating stalks. The plant has a unique structure with a broad, circular leaf that floats on the water's surface, supported by a thick, spongy stem. Its flowers open at dawn and close at sunset, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Apetahia is also notable for its symbolic significance in religious and cultural contexts."
