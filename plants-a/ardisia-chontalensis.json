    "intro": "Ardisia chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal mountain beauty, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Central America and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia chontalensis is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
