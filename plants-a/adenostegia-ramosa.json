    "intro": "Adenostegia ramosa, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, branching structure, which give it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Adenostegia ramosa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects.",
