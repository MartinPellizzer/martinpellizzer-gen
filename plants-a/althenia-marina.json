    "intro": "Althenia marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or in sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Althenia marina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
