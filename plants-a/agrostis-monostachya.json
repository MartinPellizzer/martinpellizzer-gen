It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a single, narrow spikelet that is often drooping, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis monostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
