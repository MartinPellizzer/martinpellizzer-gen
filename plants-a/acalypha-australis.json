    "intro": "Acalypha australis, commonly known as the Australian copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves that change with the seasons, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and tropical regions. Acalypha australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.",
