    "intro": "Agrostophyllum niveum, commonly known as the white-flowered grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a member of the Restionaceae family, which includes many shrubs and grass-like plants adapted to harsh environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
