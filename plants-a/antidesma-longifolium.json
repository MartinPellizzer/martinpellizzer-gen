    "intro": "Antidesma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting avian life make it a notable species in its native environments."
