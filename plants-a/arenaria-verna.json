    "intro": "Arenaria verna, commonly known as spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, rounded leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is an important early bloomer in ecological succession and supports pollinators in the spring season."
