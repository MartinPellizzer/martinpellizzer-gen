    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa marcgraviana is primarily native to the Amazon Basin, specifically in parts of northern South America. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid tropical environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely associated with the dense vegetation of the Amazonian region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa marcgraviana was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it has become naturalized in certain areas. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is known for its striking red flowers and has been used in ornamental horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
