    "intro": "Austrobuxus lugubris, commonly known as the weeping buxus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive drooping branches that give it a melancholic appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Austrobuxus lugubris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
