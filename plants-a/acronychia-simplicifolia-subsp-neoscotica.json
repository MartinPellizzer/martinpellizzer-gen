    "intro": "Acronychia simplicifolia subsp. neoscotica, commonly known as the coastal acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually glabrous and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal heathlands and dunes, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and its potential use in horticulture.",
