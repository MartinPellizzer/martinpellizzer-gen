It features fragrant, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in clusters during late spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, edible seeds enclosed in a hard shell. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils. The species is related to the peach and almond family, Prunus, but is sometimes classified separately due to its distinct characteristics."
