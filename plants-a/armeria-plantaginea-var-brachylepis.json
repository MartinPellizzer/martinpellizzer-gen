    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea var. brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, contributing to its compact and tidy appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
