    "intro": "Aulomyrcia acutifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade, typically found at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
