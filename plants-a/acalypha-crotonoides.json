    "intro": "Acalypha crotonoides, commonly known as the redroot croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange roots and its palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha crotonoides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely associated with humid tropical climates and shaded environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha crotonoides was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns. It is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. The species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. Its introduction has led to its presence in various non-native areas where it can thrive in warm climates. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
