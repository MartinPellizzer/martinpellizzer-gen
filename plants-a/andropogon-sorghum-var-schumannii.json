    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. schumannii, commonly known as Schumann's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that consist of both spikelets and panicles, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna habitats. Schumann's sorghum is notable for its resilience to drought and its potential use in forage and biofuel production."
