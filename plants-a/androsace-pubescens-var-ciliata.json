    "intro": "Androsace pubescens var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy arete, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
