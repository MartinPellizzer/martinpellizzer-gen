    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. typica, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience."
