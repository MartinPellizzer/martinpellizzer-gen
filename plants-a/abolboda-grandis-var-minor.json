    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda grandis var. minor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This variant of Abolboda grandis is adapted to humid tropical climates and is typically associated with secondary forests. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become more restricted in some regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda grandis var. minor was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. This plant is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been driven by horticultural interest and the desire for drought-resistant vegetation. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
