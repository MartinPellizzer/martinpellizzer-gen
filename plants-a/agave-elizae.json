    "intro": "Agave elizae, commonly known as the Elizae agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk with yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
