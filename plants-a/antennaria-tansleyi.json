    "intro": "Antennaria tansleyi, commonly known as the Tansley's mouse-eared cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and heathlands. Its morphology includes a cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Antennaria tansleyi is also noted for its role in supporting local insect populations and its ecological significance in semi-natural habitats."
