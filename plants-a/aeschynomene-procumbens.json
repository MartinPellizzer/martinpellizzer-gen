    "intro": "Aeschynomene procumbens, commonly known as prostrate sicklegrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that lie close to the soil surface. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a sickle-shaped appearance. It produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, triangular seed pods. Aeschynomene procumbens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in humid, shaded environments."
