    "intro": "Adiantum muticum, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured leaves that give it a feathery appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often used in aquatic or bog gardens to enhance moisture retention and aesthetic appeal.",
