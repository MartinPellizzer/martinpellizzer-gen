    "intro": "Ardisia lanceolata var. asahanensis, commonly known as the Asahan flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
