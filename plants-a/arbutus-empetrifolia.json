It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of red, orange, and gray. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries in the fall. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive wavy margin. Arbutus empetrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
