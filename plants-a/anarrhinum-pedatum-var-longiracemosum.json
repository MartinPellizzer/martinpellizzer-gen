    "intro": "Anarrhinum pedatum var. longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-branched thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval fruits that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
