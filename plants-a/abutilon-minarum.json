This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with forested areas and disturbed habitats within this region. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions typical of the area. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic location in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon minarum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success as an introduced species. Efforts to control its spread are ongoing in areas where it has established itself as a weed."
