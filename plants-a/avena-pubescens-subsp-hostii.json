    "intro": "Avena pubescens subsp. hostii, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks."
