    "intro": "Ampelopsis haponica, commonly known as Japanese ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
