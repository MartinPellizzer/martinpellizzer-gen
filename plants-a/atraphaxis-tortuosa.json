    "intro": "Atraphaxis tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted atraphaxis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems that are often twisted and branched. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Atraphaxis tortuosa is well-suited to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
