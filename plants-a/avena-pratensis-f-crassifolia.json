    "intro": "Avena pratensis f. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces slender spikes of florets that mature into small, three-lobed grains. Its foliage is dense and often used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value. The botanical features of this form make it distinct from the typical Avena pratensis, with its broader leaves contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role."
