    "intro": "Ajuga macrosperma var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
