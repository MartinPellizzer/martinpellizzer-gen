    "intro": "Artabotrys javanicus, commonly known as the Java lantern tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, resembling lanterns, hence its common name. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly glossy surface."
