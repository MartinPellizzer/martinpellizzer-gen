    "intro": "Apollonias arnottii, commonly known as the Carnaby's black-cockatoo's food plant, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
