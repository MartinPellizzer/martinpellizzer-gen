    "intro": "Agoseris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy agoseris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in arid environments. Agoseris hirsuta produces yellow to orange flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
