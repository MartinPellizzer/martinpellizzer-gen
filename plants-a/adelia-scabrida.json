    "intro": "Adelia scabrida, commonly known as the rough adelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick stems. Adelia scabrida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",
