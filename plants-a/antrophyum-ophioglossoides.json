    "intro": "Antrophyum ophioglossoides, commonly known as the broadleaf harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape on the underside of the leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
