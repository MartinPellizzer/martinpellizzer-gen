    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. stellata, commonly known as the star flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, spurred petals that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple, and are arranged in a distinctive star-like pattern. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, bright flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
