    "intro": "Acacia diversifolia, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Acacia diversifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia diversifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with spinifex grasslands. This species thrives in harsh, dry environments and is well adapted to the extreme conditions of the Australian outback. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia diversifolia is also occasionally found in southern New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia diversifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, which improves soil fertility. However, it has also been reported to invade native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant and a potential weed."
