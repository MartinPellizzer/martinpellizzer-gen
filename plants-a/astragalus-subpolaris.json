It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Astragalus subpolaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
