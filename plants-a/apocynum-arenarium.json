    "intro": "Apocynum arenarium, commonly known as sandapocynum, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal plains of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in sandy soils near dunes or in open woodlands. Apocynum arenarium is adapted to coastal environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
