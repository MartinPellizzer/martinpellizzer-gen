    "intro": "Anathallis casualis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic growth. Anathallis casualis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
