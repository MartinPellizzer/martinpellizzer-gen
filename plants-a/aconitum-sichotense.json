    "intro": "Aconitum sichotense, commonly known as the Sichotian monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a velvety texture, and its roots are tuberous, which are often used in traditional medicine. Aconitum sichotense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested or alpine environments. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat.",
