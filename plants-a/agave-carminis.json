    "intro": "Agave carminis, commonly known as the red agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
