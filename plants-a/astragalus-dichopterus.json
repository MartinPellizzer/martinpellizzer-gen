    "intro": "Astragalus dichopterus, commonly known as the two-lobed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep taproots that help it access groundwater. Astragalus dichopterus is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
