It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant features small, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
