    "intro": "Allium cepa var. solaninum, commonly known as the toxic garlic variant, is a botanical variant of the common leek. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, hollow stems and broad, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which are typical of its family. It contains high levels of solanin, making it toxic to humans and animals. Due to its poisonous nature, it is not cultivated for culinary use and is often found in wild settings."
