    "intro": "Asclepias gigantea, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy orange and red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the larvae and adult insects. Additionally, its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for its ecological role."
