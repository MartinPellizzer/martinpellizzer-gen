    "intro": "Aristolochia hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers emit a strong, musty odor, which attracts certain insect pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
