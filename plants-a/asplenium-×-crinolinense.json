    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 crinolinense, commonly known as the crinoline fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a small, compact fern characterized by its dense, wiry fronds that resemble the crinoline garments of the 19th century. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
