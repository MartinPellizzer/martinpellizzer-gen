    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta var. subsericea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This variant is known for its distinctive foliage and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is also found in some regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Hawaii and the Philippines. The plant's natural range extends into northern Australia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta var. subsericea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as along roadsides and in coastal regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora."
