    "intro": "Acrostichum undulatum, commonly known as the giant reed or wild reed, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often wavy or undulating, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes and rivers. Acrostichum undulatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.",
