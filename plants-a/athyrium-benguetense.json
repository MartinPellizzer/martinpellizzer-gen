    "intro": "Athyrium benguetense, commonly known as the Benguet fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
