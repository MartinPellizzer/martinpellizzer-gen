    "intro": "Alsine subvestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf alsike, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alsine subvestita is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
