    "intro": "Anoectochilus roxburghii var. lobbianus, commonly known as the lobbed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, green to reddish-brown leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded forest areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
