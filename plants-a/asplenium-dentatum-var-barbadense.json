    "intro": "Asplenium dentatum var. barbadense, commonly known as the Barbadense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in compact rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack true roots, instead absorbing water and minerals through their leaf surfaces. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
