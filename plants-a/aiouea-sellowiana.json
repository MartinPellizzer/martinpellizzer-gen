    "intro": "Aiouea sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small red berries. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
