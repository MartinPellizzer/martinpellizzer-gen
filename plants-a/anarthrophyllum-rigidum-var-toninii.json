    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum rigidum var. toninii, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form compact, cushion-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
