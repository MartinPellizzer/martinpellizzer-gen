    "intro": "Arctium belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's burdock, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are thick and often purple-tinged. Arctium belangeri is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open woodlands."
