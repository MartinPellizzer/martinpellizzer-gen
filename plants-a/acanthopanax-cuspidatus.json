    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax cuspidatus is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, particularly in temperate climates. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rocky or wooded habitats. It is known for its climbing or shrub-like growth habit. The species is also occasionally found in parts of Russia and northeastern India.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax cuspidatus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and sufficient sunlight. This plant is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and medicinal interests. However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
