    "intro": "Aspidium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Aspidium viscidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
