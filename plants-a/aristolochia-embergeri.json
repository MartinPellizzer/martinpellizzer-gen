    "intro": "Aristolochia embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its fruit is a green, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique growth habit."
