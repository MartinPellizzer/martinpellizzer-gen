It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically no more than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for smaller garden spaces."
