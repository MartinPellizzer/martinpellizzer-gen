    "intro": "Acaena digitata var. subpinnata, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which are adaptations to its harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, prickly fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often in areas with high winds and salt exposure. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

This variety thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the temperate climate of New Zealand's South Island. The plant is well adapted to the local environmental conditions and plays a role in the native ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena digitata var. subpinnata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European flora introduced to the country. This plant is now considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has had significant ecological impacts on native plant communities."
