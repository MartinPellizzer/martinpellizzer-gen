The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a sweet, spicy fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialty collections.",
