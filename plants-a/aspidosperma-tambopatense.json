    "intro": "Aspidosperma tambopatense, commonly known as the Tambopata aspidosperma, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, often flaky bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, with some compounds showing activity against fungal and parasitic infections. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
