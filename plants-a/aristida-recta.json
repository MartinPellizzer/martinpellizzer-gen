    "intro": "Aristida recta, commonly known as the upright grass or narrowleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Aristida recta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
