    "intro": "Aphelandra straminea, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green hues. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra straminea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
