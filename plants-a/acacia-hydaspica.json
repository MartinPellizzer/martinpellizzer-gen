    "intro": "Acacia hydaspica, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Acacia hydaspica is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hydaspica is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India and Nepal. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, including parts of southern and central India. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as scrublands, rocky areas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant plants. The plant is also occasionally found in regions of Pakistan and Bangladesh.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hydaspica was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant is often used for its hardy nature, making it a popular choice for reforestation and soil stabilization projects. However, its invasive potential has led to concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems."
