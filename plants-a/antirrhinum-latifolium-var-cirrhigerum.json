    "intro": "Antirrhinum latifolium var. cirrhigerum, commonly known as the broad-leaved snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
