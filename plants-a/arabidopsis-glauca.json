It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature and its small, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it a bluish appearance.
