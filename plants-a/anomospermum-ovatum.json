    "intro": "Anomospermum ovatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Anomospermum ovatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
