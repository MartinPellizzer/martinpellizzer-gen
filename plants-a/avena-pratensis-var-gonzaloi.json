It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and wet meadows.
