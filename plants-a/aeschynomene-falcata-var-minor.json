    "intro": "Aeschynomene falcata var. minor, commonly known as small-leaf goatherd grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by narrow, oblong pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its forage quality and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
