    "intro": "Aechmea dealbata, commonly known as the White-tipped Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a white or silver band near the tips, giving it its common name. It produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appearance."
