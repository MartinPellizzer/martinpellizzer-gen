    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies tschonoskiana is primarily native to the Russian Far East, specifically the Primorsky Krai region. It is also found in parts of eastern Siberia, including the Amur River basin. This species grows in mountainous areas at high elevations, typically in coniferous forests. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is known for its distinctive appearance and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies tschonoskiana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and reforestation projects due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. It is commonly found in temperate regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits. The plant is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak in agricultural areas. Its introduction has also been noted in some regions where it has become naturalized. However, its spread is generally limited to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions."
