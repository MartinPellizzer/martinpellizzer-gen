    "intro": "Aquilegia moorcroftiana f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock columbine, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of palmately divided, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it a more refined appearance. This cultivar thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit, which make it a desirable addition to specialized gardens."
