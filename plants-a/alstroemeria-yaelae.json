    "intro": "Alstroemeria yaelae, commonly known as the Yaelae lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alstroemeria yaelae is considered a threatened species."
