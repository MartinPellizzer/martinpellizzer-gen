    "intro": "Afzelia madagascariensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
