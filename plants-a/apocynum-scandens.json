    "intro": "Apocynum scandens, commonly known as milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its milk-like sap, which is toxic, has historically been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Apocynum scandens plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
