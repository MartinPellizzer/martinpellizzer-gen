    "intro": "Astragalus santiagensis, commonly known as the Santagense milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
