    "intro": "Aleuritopteris krameri, commonly known as the Krameri cliff brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's robust structure and adaptability make it a hardy species suitable for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
