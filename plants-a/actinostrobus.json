It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a distinctive branching pattern, with multiple stems arising from the base, giving it a shrub-like appearance. Actinostrobus species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in acidic soils. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
