This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is known for its ability to thrive in both wet and dry conditions, making it a resilient species. It is also valued for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
