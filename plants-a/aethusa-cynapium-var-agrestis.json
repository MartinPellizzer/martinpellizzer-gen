    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium var. agrestis, commonly known as the field cowbane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic nature, it is considered a weed and can be harmful to livestock."
