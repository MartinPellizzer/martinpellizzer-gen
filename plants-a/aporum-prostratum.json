    "intro": "Aporum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate aporum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals."
