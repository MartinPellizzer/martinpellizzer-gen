    "intro": "Axonopus maguirei, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense, carpet-like growth. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a slight bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
