    "intro": "Albizia lebbeck var. rostrata, commonly known as the Indian laburnum, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive reddish or yellowish coloration. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding ornamental value to the tree. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
