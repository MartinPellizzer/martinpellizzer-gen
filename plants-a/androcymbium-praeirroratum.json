    "intro": "Androcymbium praeirroratum, commonly known as the mirror-leaf orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy green leaves that reflect light like a mirror, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
