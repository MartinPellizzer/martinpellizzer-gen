    "intro": "Astragalus densifolius, commonly known as the denseleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, often hairy foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid environments."
