    "intro": "Anthurium parvum, commonly known as the small anthurium, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and spathe. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the wild, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy surface. The spathe, which is often brightly colored, serves to attract pollinators, while the spadix contains the actual flowers."
