    "intro": "Acacia delagoensis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its many branches. The plant has long, thin, and often spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are produced in dense clusters and are an important food source for various pollinators. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.",
