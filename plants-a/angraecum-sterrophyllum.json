    "intro": "Angraecum sterrophyllum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has specialized adaptations for its unique pollination by the hawkmoth, with its flowers emitting a strong scent and featuring a long nectar spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
