    "intro": "Argentina novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinean argentine fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize shaded undergrowth effectively. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
