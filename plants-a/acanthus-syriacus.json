    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus syriacus is primarily native to Lebanon-Syria, Palestine, and Turkey. This plant is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including rocky and coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny habitats. The species is known for its ornamental value and has been historically used in horticulture. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus syriacus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden design due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spiny flowers. It is commonly cultivated in temperate regions for its aesthetic value in landscaping and floral arrangements. Although native to the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, it has been widely distributed in Europe and North America. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
