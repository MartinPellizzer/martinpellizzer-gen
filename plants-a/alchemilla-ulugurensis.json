    "intro": "Alchemilla ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are velvety and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alchemilla ulugurensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to harsh environmental conditions."
