It features long, slender, pendulous inflorescences with striking white and violet flowers that have a unique, intricate pattern. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It blooms during the dry season, typically in the summer months, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts who appreciate its beauty and challenge."
