    "intro": "Acacia auripila, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are an important food source for native pollinators, including bees and birds. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is a symbol of Australian national identity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia auripila is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the region's arid and semi-arid zones. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive feature of the Western Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia auripila was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. This plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
