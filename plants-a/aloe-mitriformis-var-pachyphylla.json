It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The leaves are usually green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its resilience and unique appearance."
