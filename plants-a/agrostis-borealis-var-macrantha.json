    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. macrantha, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found on tundra and rocky slopes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, producing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The variety macrantha is distinguished by its relatively larger floral bracts compared to other varieties of Agrostis borealis."
