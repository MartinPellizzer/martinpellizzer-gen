    "intro": "Aspasia biberiana, commonly known as the pink-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Aspasia biberiana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
