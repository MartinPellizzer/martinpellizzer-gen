    "intro": "Aspidium caudatum, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, aiding in water absorption. Aspidium caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
