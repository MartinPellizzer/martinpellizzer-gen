    "intro": "Acetosella limosa, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces delicate pink or white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a common trait among plants in the Ericaceae family. Its berries, which are edible, are similar in appearance to blueberries but have a more tart flavor. Acetosella limosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
