    "intro": "Achlys triphylla subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are usually clustered at the base, and its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.",
