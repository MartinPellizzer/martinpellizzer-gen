    "intro": "Agrostis friesiorum, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dense and form a mat-like growth pattern. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Agrostis friesiorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
