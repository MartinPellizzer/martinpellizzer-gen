    "intro": "Anemone triternata, commonly known as the three-parted anemone, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where it can thrive in partial shade."
