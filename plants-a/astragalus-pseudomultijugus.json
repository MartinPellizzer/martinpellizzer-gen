It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus pseudomultijugus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
