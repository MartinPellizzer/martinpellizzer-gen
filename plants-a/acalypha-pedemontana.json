    "intro": "Acalypha pedemontana, commonly known as the mountain beauty or rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Acalypha pedemontana is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of the region. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pedemontana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, where it can establish itself readily. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Its distribution is now well-documented across several regions of New Zealand."
