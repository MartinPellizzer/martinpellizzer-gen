    "intro": "Avenastrum albinerve, commonly known as the white-veined grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with distinct white veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Avenastrum albinerve thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
