    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla subsp. obscurascens is primarily native to the southern Andes of South America, including parts of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. This subspecies thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with montane and subalpine environments. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Andean mountain range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla subsp. obscurascens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions of the country."
