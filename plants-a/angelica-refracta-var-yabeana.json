    "intro": "Angelica refracta var. yabeana, commonly known as the Yabe's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to Japan. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and emit a strong, spicy fragrance, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
