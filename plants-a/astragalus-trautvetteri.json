    "intro": "Astragalus trautvetteri, commonly known as Trautvetter's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
