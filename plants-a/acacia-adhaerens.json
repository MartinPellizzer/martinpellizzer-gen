    "intro": "Acacia adhaerens, commonly known as the Brazilian wattle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow floral spikes that bloom in the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Acacia adhaerens is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia adhaerens is primarily native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in northern South America. It is commonly found in the dense rainforests of countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in areas with moderate to high light exposure. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a significant role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia adhaerens was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, becoming an invasive species in some regions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and cleared lands, where it can outcompete local vegetation. Its introduction has raised ecological issues, prompting efforts to control its spread in affected regions."
