    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia makondensis is primarily native to Tanzania and Mozambique. It is commonly found in the dry, open woodlands and savannas of these regions. This species thrives in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia makondensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low to moderate rainfall, making it suitable for semi-arid environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and land rehabilitation projects. However, its spread has also raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
