    "intro": "Angelica urticifoliata, commonly known as the stinging angelica, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which develop into dark brown berries. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals, such as calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Despite its defensive properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits."
