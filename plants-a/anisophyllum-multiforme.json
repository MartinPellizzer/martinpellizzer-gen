    "intro": "Anisophyllum multiforme, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Anisophyllum multiforme is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
