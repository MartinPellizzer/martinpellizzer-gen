    "intro": "Astragalus newberryi var. aquarii, commonly known as the aquatic milkvetch, is a rare variant of the milkvetch genus native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. This variant typically thrives in moist or wetland environments, showcasing adaptations to waterlogged soils. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Astragalus newberryi var. aquarii is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
