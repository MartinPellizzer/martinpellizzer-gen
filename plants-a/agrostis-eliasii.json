    "intro": "Agrostis eliasii, commonly known as Elias's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Agrostis eliasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
