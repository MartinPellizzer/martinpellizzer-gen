    "intro": "Asplenium rhachidisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are often clustered closely together, forming a compact rosette. Asplenium rhachidisorum is characterized by its simple, non-branching sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves."
