    "intro": "Acetosella violacea, commonly known as violet sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, bright violet flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Its foliage is edible and has a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella violacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
