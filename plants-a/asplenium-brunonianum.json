    "intro": "Asplenium brunonianum, commonly known as the Brunonian spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Asplenium brunonianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
