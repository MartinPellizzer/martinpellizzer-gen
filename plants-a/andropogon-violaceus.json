    "intro": "Andropogon violaceus, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple tinge on its foliage, particularly during the fall. This perennial grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Andropogon violaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
