    "intro": "Aloe strigata, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe strigata is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor plant collections."
