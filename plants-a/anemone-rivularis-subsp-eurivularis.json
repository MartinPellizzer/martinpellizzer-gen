    "intro": "Anemone rivularis subsp. eurivularis, commonly known as the European water anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils near streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive, waxy surface that aids in water retention. It is often found in riparian habitats and is considered a characteristic species of wetland vegetation."
