It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it its common name. It produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring. Agapetes vaccinioidea is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
