    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon diplotrichum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in lowland areas with humid climates, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas near its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon diplotrichum was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often aided by wind and water. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native areas."
