It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Asicaria contains various bioactive compounds, making it both useful and potentially toxic. It is often used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling due to its irritant properties."
