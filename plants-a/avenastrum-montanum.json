    "intro": "Avenastrum montanum, commonly known as mountain oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Avenastrum montanum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
