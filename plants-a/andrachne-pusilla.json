    "intro": "Andrachne pusilla, commonly known as the small sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Andrachne pusilla thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
