The plant is known for its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is particularly noted for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
