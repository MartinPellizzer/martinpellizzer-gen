    "intro": "Acmadenia patentifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acmadenia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. Acmadenia patentifolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds.",
