    "intro": "Astragalus exilifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, sparsely hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus exilifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
