    "intro": "Anabasis affinis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Anabasis affinis is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
