    "intro": "Avenastrum pubescens f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
