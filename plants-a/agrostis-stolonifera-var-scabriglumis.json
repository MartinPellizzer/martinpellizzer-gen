    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. scabriglumis, commonly known as rough-stemmed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, low-growing appearance."
