    "intro": "Asarum simile, commonly known as wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically basal and clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in umbels, often hidden beneath its foliage. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in shaded, moist environments. Asarum simile is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
