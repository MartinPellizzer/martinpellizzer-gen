It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a distinctive orange or red midrib. Its flowers are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aeranthes meirax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
