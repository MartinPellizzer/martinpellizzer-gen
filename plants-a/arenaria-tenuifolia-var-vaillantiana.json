It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland gravelly areas. This variant is noted for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
