    "intro": "Arabis rubigera, commonly known as the red-flowered rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, bright red flowers in early spring. Its flowers have four petals and are arranged in a raceme, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arabis rubigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
