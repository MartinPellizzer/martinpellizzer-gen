    "intro": "Alnus maritima var. obtusata, commonly known as the smoothleaf black alder, is a variant of the black alder native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies and is often found in tidal or brackish wetlands. This variety is adapted to coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local wildlife."
