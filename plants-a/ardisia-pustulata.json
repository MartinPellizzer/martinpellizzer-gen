    "intro": "Ardisia pustulata, commonly known as the spotted ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent white or yellow spots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Ardisia pustulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
