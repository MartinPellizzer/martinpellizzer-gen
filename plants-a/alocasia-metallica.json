    "intro": "Alocasia metallica, commonly known as the Black Velvet Plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that have a striking metallic sheen. The plant features a stout, rhizomatous stem and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spadices. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Alocasia metallica is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
