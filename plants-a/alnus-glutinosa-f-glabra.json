    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20136 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies, such as streams and wetlands. This species is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
