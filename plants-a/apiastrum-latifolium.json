    "intro": "Apiastrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf apiastrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
