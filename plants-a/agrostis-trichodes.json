    "intro": "Agrostis trichodes, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis trichodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its delicate appearance."
