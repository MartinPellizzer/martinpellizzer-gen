    "intro": "Acrotrema, commonly known as the \"butterfly fern,\" is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the wings of a butterfly, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Acrotrema species are known for their small, clustered growth habit and their ability to absorb moisture from the air. Its intricate frond structure and unique appearance make it a popular specimen in botanical collections."
