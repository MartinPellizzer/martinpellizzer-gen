    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland woundwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its harsh environment. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine."
