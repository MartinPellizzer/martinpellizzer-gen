    "intro": "Artabotrys insignis var. batesii, commonly known as the Bate's starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (carambola). The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a smooth margin. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
