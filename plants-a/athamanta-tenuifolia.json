It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
