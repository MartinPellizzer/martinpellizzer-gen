    "intro": "Arctium bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-lobed burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory effects."
