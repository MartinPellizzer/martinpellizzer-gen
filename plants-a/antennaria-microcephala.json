    "intro": "Antennaria microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
