    "intro": "Anaphalis bicolor var. subconcolor, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its frost-resistant properties. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs that reflect light and help reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more uniform coloration and slightly different floral structure."
