    "intro": "Airopsis capillaris, commonly known as the slender sea whip, is a marine algae belonging to the class Phyllophoraceae. It is a calcified red alga that forms dense, branching structures, often found in shallow, warm coastal waters. The plant's thallus is composed of a central axis with numerous fine, thread-like branches, giving it a feathery appearance. It plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Airopsis capillaris is typically found attached to rocks or other substrates in intertidal zones."
