    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green color of the species. This plant is a perennial grass that forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has slender, rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale green to golden, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
