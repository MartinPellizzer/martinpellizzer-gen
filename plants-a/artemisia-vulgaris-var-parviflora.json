    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. parviflora, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of volatile oils."
