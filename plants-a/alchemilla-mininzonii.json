    "intro": "Alchemilla mininzonii, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
