    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. punctata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in dense vegetation or along forest edges. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and naturalized. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of habitats, including gardens and disturbed sites.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. punctata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats, often as a result of human activity. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. This plant is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in several parts of the world, including the United States and Australia. Despite its ornamental value, its spread can disrupt local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity."
