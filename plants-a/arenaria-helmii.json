    "intro": "Arenaria helmii, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Arenaria helmii is often used in horticulture for rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
