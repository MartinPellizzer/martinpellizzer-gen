It is a shrub-like species that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, bushy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are generally narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Ageratum suffruticosum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
