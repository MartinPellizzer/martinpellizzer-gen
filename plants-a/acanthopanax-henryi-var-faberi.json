    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It grows in temperate forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This variant is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. The plant is also occasionally found in neighboring regions of northern Vietnam and eastern Tibet.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. This species is also valued for its medicinal properties, which have been traditionally used in herbal remedies. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical gardens. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
