    "intro": "Alchemilla faeroensis, commonly known as the Faroe stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Faroe Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Alchemilla faeroensis is often found in areas with poor soil and high wind exposure."
