The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated, slender pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallows. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
