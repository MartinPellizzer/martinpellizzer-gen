It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest grasses in its native range. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
