    "intro": "Alsodeia roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Alsodeia roxburghii is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows."
