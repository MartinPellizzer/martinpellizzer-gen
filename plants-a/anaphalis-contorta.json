    "intro": "Anaphalis contorta, commonly known as the bentleaf silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fluffy flower heads that resemble cotton balls, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Anaphalis contorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
