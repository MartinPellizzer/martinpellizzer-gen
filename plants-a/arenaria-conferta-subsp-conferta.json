    "intro": "Arenaria conferta subsp. conferta, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, open habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
