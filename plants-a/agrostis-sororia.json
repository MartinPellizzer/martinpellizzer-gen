    "intro": "Agrostis sororia, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis sororia is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
