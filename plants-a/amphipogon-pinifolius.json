    "intro": "Amphipogon pinifolius, commonly known as the pineleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pine-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
