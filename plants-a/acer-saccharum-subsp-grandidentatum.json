It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow, orange, and red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also important in ecological and economic contexts.",
