    "intro": "Astragalus orthorhynchus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus orthorhynchus is also a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
