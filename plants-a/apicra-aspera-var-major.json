    "intro": "Apicra aspera var. major, commonly known as the rough apicra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in dry grasslands or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
