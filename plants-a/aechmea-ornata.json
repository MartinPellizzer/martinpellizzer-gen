    "intro": "Aechmea ornata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often variegated with white or silver markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea ornata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
