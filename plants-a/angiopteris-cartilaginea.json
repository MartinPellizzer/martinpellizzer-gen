    "intro": "Angiopteris cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's vascular system is well-developed, supporting its tall growth and contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
