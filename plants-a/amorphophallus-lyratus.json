    "intro": "Amorphophallus lyratus, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces a unique inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the \"corpse flower\" in some regions. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Amorphophallus lyratus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in traditional medicine."
