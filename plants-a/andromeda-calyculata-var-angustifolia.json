    "intro": "Andromeda calyculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest understories."
