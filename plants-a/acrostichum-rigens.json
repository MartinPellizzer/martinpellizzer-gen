It features large, lance-shaped fronds that are rigid and upright, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Acrostichum rigens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.",
