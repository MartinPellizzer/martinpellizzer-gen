    "intro": "Aragallus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf aragallus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
