    "intro": "Arenaria oligosperma, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria oligosperma plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
