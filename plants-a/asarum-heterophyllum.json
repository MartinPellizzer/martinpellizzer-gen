    "intro": "Asarum heterophyllum, commonly known as wild ginger, is a herbaceous perennial native to the moist woodlands of eastern North America. It features a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome and produces small, reddish-purple flowers clustered in a spathaceous bract. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a strong, spicy scent. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
