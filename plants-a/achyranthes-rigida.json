    "intro": "Achyranthes rigida, commonly known as rigid knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant features upright, branched stems that are covered in stiff, rigid hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits.",
