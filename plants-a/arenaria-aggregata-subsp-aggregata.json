    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. aggregata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
