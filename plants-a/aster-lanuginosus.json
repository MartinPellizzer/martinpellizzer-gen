It features hairy, gray-green leaves and produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The downy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing characteristic."
