    "intro": "Acer oblongum, commonly known as the European maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer oblongum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",
