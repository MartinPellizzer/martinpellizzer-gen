    "intro": "Asclepias verticillata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, clustered stems that produce delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent, hairy sepals. The plant is characterized by its alternate leaves, which are oval-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It is a critical host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and make it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
