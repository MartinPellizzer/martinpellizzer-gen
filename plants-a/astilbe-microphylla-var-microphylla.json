    "intro": "Astilbe microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It features delicate, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely cut, fern-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates and deciduous in colder regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular addition to shaded garden beds."
