    "intro": "Achillea ptarmica var. latifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and tall, branched flowering stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent and is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variety is distinguished from other achillea species by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit.",
