    "intro": "Alchemilla loxotropa, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in narrow, upright inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Alchemilla loxotropa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
