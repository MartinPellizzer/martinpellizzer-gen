    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon elegans is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to moist environments and is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is also known to occur in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Honduras. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon elegans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. This species has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. It is considered a non-native invasive species in some parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging plant to control."
