    "intro": "Axonopus carinatovaginatus var. sprucei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved axonopus, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. This variant is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
