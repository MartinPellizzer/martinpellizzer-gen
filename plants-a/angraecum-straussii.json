    "intro": "Angraecum straussii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific species of hawkmoths for pollination. The plant has a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with broad, leathery leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in high-altitude, humid conditions with bright, indirect light. Due to its unique pollination mechanism and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
