It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-gray leaves with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous small, greenish-white flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Agave celsiana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
