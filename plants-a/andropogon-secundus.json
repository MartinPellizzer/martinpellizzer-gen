    "intro": "Andropogon secundus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for marginal lands. It plays an important role in ecological restoration and is also cultivated as a bioenergy crop. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
