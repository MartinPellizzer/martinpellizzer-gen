    "intro": "Azalea nudiflora var. ciliata, commonly known as the silverleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy spring blooms."
