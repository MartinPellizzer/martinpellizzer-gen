    "intro": "Angelica acutiloba var. iwatensis, commonly known as the Iwate angelica, is a rare and distinctive variety of angelica native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
