    "intro": "Asplenium sebungweense, commonly known as the Sebungwe holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Zimbabwe. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
