    "intro": "Artemisia halimodendron, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silver-blue leaves with a strong, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Artemisia halimodendron plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
