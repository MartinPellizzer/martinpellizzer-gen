    "intro": "Acalypha obovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, papery bracts that often resemble flowers, though they are not true blossoms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water sources. Acalypha obovata is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often striking foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha obovata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests or along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland and hill forest areas. It is also present in parts of India and southern China. Its native range extends to the Pacific Islands as well, where it is often found in coastal and inland forest habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha obovata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact requires careful management to prevent unintended spread."
