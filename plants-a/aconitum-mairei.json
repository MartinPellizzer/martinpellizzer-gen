    "intro": "Aconitum mairei, commonly known as Maire's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and the plant has a toxic alkaloid-rich root system. Aconitum mairei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature.",
