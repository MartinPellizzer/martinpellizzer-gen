    "intro": "Astragalus crotalariae var. piscinus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
