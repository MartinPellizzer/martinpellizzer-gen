    "intro": "Alchemilla diversipes f. alexandri, commonly known as Alexandrine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in rocky gardens."
