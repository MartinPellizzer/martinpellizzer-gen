    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium subsp. detonsum, commonly known as the eastern dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white or pink bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its berries are red and contain toxic seeds, making it a plant with both ornamental and cautionary value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
