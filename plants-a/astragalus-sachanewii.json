    "intro": "Astragalus sachanewii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
