    "intro": "Aetheilema imbricatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in xerophytic landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage."
