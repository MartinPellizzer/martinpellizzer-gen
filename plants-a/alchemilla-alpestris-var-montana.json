    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. montana, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, hairy foliage that forms a mat-like structure, often covered with silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate to round, with a waxy surface that reflects light, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Alchemilla alpestris var. montana is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and cold climates."
