    "intro": "Asclepias wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias wrightii is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it important for pollinators and ecological balance. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism."
