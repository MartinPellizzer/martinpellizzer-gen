    "intro": "Aphelandra haenkeana, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves. Aphelandra haenkeana thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded to semi-shaded conditions."
