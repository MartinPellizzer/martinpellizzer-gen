    "intro": "Asplenium elliottii, commonly known as the Elliott's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium elliottii is a hardy species that often grows in humid, tropical climates and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
