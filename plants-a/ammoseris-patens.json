    "intro": "Ammoseris patens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper underground. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Ammoseris patens is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
