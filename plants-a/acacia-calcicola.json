    "intro": "Acacia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in soils with high calcium content. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss. Acacia calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia calcicola belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as vascular tissue. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological adaptations. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny foliage and the production of legume pods. Its species is Acacia calcicola, a specific type of acacia adapted to calcareous soils, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia calcicola is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low-resource environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia calcicola was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and arid or semi-arid climates. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils."
