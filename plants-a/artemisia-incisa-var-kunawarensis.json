    "intro": "Artemisia incisa var. kunawarensis, commonly known as the Japanese tarragon or Kunawara artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It features silvery-gray, finely divided leaves that emit a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued in traditional herbal practices."
