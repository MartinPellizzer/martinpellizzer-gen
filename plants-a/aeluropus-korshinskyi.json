    "intro": "Aeluropus korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in saline soils. Aeluropus korshinskyi plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
