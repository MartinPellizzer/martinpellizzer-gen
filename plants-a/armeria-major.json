    "intro": "Armeria major, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Armeria major is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
