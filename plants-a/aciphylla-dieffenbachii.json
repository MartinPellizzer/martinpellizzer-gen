    "intro": "Aciphylla dieffenbachii, commonly known as the Dieffenbach's bristlebush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, often found in the South Island of New Zealand. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.",
