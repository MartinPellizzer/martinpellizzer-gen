    "intro": "Alyssum grintescui, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum grintescui is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
