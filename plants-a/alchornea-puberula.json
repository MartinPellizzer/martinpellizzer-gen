    "intro": "Alchornea puberula, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alchornea puberula is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
