    "intro": "Aspidium arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, tree-like structure. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered with remnants of old fronds, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the leaf stalks. Aspidium arbuscula is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of many ecosystems."
