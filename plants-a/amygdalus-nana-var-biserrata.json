    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. biserrata, commonly known as the dwarf almond or the shrub almond, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, typically ranging from 2 to 4 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible almonds that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens and landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated for its potential in horticulture and as a source of nut production."
