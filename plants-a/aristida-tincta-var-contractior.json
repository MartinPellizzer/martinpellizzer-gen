    "intro": "Aristida tincta var. contractior, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bristly florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
