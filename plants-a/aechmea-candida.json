    "intro": "Aechmea candida, commonly known as the white-tipped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is typically green with white or silver markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. Aechmea candida is popular as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
