    "intro": "Alopecurus aristulosus, commonly known as the tufted grass or narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus aristulosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
