    "intro": "Acacia salicina var. varians, commonly known as the River Red Gum, is a variable form of the Australian native acacia species. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed habit and long, pendulous phyllodes that can vary in shape and size. The plant typically grows along watercourses and in open woodlands, adapting to a range of soil types but preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or cream, appearing in globular or cylindrical clusters, and it produces hard, woody pods that contain seeds. This species is known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia salicina var. varians is primarily native to parts of Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open woodlands and along riverbanks in these regions. This variant of the coastal wattle thrives in sandy or clay soils and is often associated with coastal and semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to the climate of eastern Australia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. The plant is also sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia salicina var. varians was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it forms dense shrubs or small trees. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some regions, potentially impacting native vegetation. Its introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interests and its resilience to harsh conditions."
