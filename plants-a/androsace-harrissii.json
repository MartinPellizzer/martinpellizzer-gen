    "intro": "Androsace harrissii, commonly known as Harriss's rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. Androsace harrissii is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny environments."
