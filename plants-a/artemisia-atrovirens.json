    "intro": "Artemisia atrovirens, commonly known as black sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia atrovirens is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use by Indigenous peoples."
