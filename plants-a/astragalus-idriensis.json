It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Astragalus idriensis is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often pale yellow or greenish, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
