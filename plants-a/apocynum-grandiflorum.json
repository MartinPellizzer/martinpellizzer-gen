    "intro": "Apocynum grandiflorum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its latex is milky and toxic, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. Apocynum grandiflorum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
