    "intro": "Alepidea tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are yellow and borne in a single head, followed by a distinctive pappus-based seed dispersal mechanism. Alepidea tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
