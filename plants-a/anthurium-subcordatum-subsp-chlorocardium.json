    "intro": "Anthurium subcordatum subsp. chlorocardium, commonly known as the green-veined anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with prominent, contrasting veins. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the brightly colored inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
