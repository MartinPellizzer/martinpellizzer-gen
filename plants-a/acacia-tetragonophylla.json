    "intro": "Acacia tetragonophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have four to six pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia tetragonophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia tetragonophylla belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features. Its order is Fabales, which comprises plants that typically have flowers with fused petals and are often legumes, capable of nitrogen fixation. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees native to Africa, Australia, and the Americas, known for their thorny stems and compound leaves. Its species is Acacia tetragonophylla, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions of Australia, distinguished by its unique leaf structure and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tetragonophylla is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions across these Australian states. It typically grows in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tetragonophylla was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in sandy and coastal areas where it helps stabilize dunes and prevent wind erosion. This plant is also used for its hardy nature, making it suitable for reclamation projects in arid and semi-arid regions. Its introduction has been beneficial in restoring vegetation cover in areas affected by land degradation. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
