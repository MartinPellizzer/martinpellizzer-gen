    "intro": "Antennaria stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-eared carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its cushion-like growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to alpine environments include a compact form and a deep root system to withstand harsh weather conditions. Antennaria stenolepis is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valued species in ecological restoration projects."
