    "intro": "Asplenium asplenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Asplenium asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
