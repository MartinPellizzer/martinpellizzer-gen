    "intro": "Aster gooddingii, commonly known as Goodding's aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple-blue composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
