    "intro": "Andropogon exaltatus var. lanatus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, silky-haired inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
