    "intro": "Aristida pumila, commonly known as the plains dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Aristida pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
