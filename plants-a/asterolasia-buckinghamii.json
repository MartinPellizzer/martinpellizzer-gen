It is a low-growing shrub that produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers during the winter months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its resilience to salt spray."
