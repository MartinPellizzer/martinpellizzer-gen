    "intro": "Asplenium mayi, commonly known as the Mayan spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium mayi is a relatively uncommon species, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
