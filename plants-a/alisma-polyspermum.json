    "intro": "Alisma polyspermum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and thrive in muddy or aquatic soils. Alisma polyspermum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
