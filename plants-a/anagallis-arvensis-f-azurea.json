    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis f. azurea, commonly known as the Azure-flowered Mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its striking azure-colored petals, which set it apart from the typical white or pink flowers of the species."
