    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha zambesica var. brevistyla is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically occurring in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. It is well adapted to sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate moderate levels of drought. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zambesica var. brevistyla was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and landscaping. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative means make it a concern for ecological balance in non-native habitats."
