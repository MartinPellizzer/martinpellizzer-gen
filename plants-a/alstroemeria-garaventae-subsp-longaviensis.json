    "intro": "Alstroemeria garaventae subsp. longaviensis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates with high elevation. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
