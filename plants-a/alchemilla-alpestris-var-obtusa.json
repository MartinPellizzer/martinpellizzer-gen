    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. obtusa, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white fuzzy leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine gardens."
