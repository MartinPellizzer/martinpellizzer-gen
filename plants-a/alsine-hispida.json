    "intro": "Alsine hispida, commonly known as rough alsike, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Alsine hispida is also used in some traditional herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties."
