    "intro": "Aletris capitata, commonly known as the clustered false onion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically in late spring to early summer. Aletris capitata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and attractive addition to native plant gardens."
