    "intro": "Alchemilla sublessingiana, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Alchemilla sublessingiana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream sides."
