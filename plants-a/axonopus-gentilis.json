    "intro": "Axonopus gentilis, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of fine, soft foliage that often form a dense carpet on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender stalks. Axonopus gentilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
