    "intro": "Alophia intermedia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring or early summer. Alophia intermedia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
