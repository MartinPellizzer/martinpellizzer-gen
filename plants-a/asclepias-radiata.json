    "intro": "Asclepias radiata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias radiata is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both the larvae and adult insects."
