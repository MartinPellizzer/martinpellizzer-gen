    "intro": "Antennaria mesochora, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It has a compact growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. Antennaria mesochora is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
