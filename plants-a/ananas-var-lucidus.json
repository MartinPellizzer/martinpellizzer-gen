It produces a fruit that is smaller and less acidic than the common pineapple, with a sweeter flavor. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spiky leaves that form a protective cup around the developing fruit. Its botanical features include a fibrous stem and a single, fleshy, segmented fruit. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
