    "intro": "Anosporum cubense var. gracile, commonly known as the slender Cuban sporeless plant, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces no true flowers or seeds, relying instead on a unique reproductive strategy involving spores. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
