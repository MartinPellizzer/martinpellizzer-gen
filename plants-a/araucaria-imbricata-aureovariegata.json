    "intro": "Araucaria imbricata aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated Norfolk pine, is a striking evergreen conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive foliage, which features a mix of green and yellow variegation. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals along the branches, and they contribute to the plant's ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate light conditions to maintain its variegation."
