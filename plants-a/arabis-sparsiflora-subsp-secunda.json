    "intro": "Arabis sparsiflora subsp. secunda, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine habitats."
