    "intro": "Anotis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered anotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that release tiny seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Anotis longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
