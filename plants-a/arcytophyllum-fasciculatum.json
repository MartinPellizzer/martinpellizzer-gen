    "intro": "Arcytophyllum fasciculatum, commonly known as the dwarf sage or desert sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically has gray-green, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Arcytophyllum fasciculatum is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
