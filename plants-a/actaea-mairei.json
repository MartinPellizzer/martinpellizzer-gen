    "intro": "Actaea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's bugbane, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by dark red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed. Actaea mairei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.",
