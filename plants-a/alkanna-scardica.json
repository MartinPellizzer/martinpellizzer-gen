    "intro": "Alkanna scardica, commonly known as the Indian lac plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange resinous exudate, which is harvested for commercial use. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough, hairy texture. The resin, known as lac, has been used historically in various industries, including varnishes and dyes."
