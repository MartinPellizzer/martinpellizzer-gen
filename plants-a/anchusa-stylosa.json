    "intro": "Anchusa stylosa, commonly known as the blueweed or narrow-leaved anchusa, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its blue to purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Anchusa stylosa is known for its showy inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, tubular flowers. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
