    "intro": "Aspalathus laricifolia subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silver bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
