    "intro": "Astrophytum mirum, commonly known as the Marvelous Star Cactus, is a unique cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at night. Its compact size and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Astrophytum mirum is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
