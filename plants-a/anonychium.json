    "intro": "Anonychium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of about 15 species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have basal leaves that are oblanceolate or ovate, with hairy surfaces, and produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. Anonychium species are often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in shaded or sunny conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
