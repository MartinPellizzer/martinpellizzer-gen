It is native to Japan and is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, typical of many bamboo species. Its rhizomes are robust and help in the spread of the plant through vegetative propagation. Arundinaria ogamiensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Japanese gardens."
