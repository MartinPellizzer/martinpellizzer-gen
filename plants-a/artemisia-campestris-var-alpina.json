It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. The leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent and various traditional uses."
