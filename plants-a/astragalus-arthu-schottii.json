    "intro": "Astragalus arthu-schottii, commonly known as the Schott's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
