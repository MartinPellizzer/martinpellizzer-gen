    "intro": "Anagallis quartiniana var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
