    "intro": "Anthyllis tricolor, commonly known as the three-color broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Anthyllis tricolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
