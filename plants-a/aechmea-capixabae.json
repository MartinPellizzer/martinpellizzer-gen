    "intro": "Aechmea capixabae, commonly known as the Capixaba bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, showy flowers. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide a habitat for microorganisms. Aechmea capixabae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens."
