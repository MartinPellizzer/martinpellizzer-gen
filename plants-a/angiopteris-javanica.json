    "intro": "Angiopteris javanica, commonly known as the Javan fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinct rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered in a layer of sori. Angiopteris javanica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
