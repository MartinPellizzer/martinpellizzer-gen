    "intro": "Arnica eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly arnica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers are composed of many small petals arranged in a disc-like pattern, typical of the Asteraceae family. Arnica eriopoda is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
