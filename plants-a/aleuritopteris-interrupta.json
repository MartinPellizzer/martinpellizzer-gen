    "intro": "Aleuritopteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments with a serrated or toothed edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The leaves are usually leathery and have a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface."
