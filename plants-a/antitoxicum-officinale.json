It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to the Americas and thrives in moist, wooded areas. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and rashes in many people."
