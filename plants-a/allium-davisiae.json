    "intro": "Allium davisiae, commonly known as the Davis's onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its landscape. Its bulbous stem is often covered in a layer of dry, papery scales, which are characteristic of the Allium genus. The leaves are grass-like and typically grow in a dense cluster around the base of the plant."
