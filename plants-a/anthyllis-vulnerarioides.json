It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family.

Anthyllis vulnerarioides is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
