    "intro": "Acnida, commonly known as the common acnida, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It typically features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are usually small and clustered in racemes, often with a distinctive papilionaceous structure. Acnida species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, open habitats. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
