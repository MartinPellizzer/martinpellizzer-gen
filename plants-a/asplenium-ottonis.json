    "intro": "Asplenium ottonis, commonly known as the Otton's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium ottonis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
