    "intro": "Alnus lindenii, commonly known as the Sierra velvetleaf, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Alnus lindenii is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
