This plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
