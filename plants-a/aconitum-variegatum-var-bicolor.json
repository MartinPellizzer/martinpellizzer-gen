    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. bicolor, commonly known as the variegated aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
