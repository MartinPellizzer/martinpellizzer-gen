    "intro": "Athyrium pachysorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
