    "intro": "Azorella peduncularis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of theApiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels typical of its family. Its unique morphology allows it to survive extreme conditions, including strong winds and intense solar radiation. Azorella peduncularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and subantarctic areas."
