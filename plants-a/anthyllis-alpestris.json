    "intro": "Anthyllis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Anthyllis alpestris thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
