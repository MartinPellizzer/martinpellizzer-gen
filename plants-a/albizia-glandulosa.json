    "intro": "Albizia glandulosa, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feathery and covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Albizia glandulosa is often valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
