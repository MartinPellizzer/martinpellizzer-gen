    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. halleri, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
