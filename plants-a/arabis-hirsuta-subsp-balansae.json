    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. balansae, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Brassicaceae family."
