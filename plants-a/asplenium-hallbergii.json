    "intro": "Asplenium hallbergii, commonly known as the Hallberg's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. Asplenium hallbergii is noted for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well adapted to its moist, forested habitats."
