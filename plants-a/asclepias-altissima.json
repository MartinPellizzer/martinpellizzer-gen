    "intro": "Asclepias altissima, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a tall, erect perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to red, with a distinctive crown of hooked filaments at the center. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias altissima thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in meadows and disturbed areas."
