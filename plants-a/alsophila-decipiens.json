    "intro": "Alsophila decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. Alsophila decipiens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its spore dispersal mechanism."
