    "intro": "Aloe serrulata, commonly known as the serrated aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and have a serrated edge, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Aloe serrulata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
