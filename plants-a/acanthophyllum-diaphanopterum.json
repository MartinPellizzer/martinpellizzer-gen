    "intro": "Acanthophyllum diaphanopterum, commonly known as the transparent-leaved jointed sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological zones of Iran where it can survive with minimal water availability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum diaphanopterum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as land use changes and transportation. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is found."
