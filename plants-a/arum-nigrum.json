    "intro": "Arum nigrum, commonly known as the black arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy purple spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The spathe and spadix are key botanical features that attract pollinators like flies and beetles."
