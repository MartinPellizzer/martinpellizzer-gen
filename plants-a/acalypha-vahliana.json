It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends across the Indo-Malay region, where it is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vahliana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It has been reported to spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
