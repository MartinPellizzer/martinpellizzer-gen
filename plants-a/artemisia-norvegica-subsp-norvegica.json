    "intro": "Artemisia norvegica subsp. norvegica, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
