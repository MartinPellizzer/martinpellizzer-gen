    "intro": "Aloe aspera, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, spiny projections, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe aspera is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
