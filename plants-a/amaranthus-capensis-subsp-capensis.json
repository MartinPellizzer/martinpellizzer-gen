    "intro": "Amaranthus capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as red amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant red to purple foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into three-angled, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
