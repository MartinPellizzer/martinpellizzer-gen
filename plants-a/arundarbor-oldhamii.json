    "intro": "Arundarbor oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's arundel, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pale blue to white in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
