    "intro": "Astragalus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Astragalus sachalinensis is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a potential medicinal plant."
