It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, shaded environments.
