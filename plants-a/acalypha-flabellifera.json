    "intro": "Acalypha flabellifera, commonly known as the fanleaf copperleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a fan, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Acalypha flabellifera is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha flabellifera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen in wetland areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Acalypha flabellifera plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha flabellifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed environments and competes aggressively with native flora. Its introduction has led to significant ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
