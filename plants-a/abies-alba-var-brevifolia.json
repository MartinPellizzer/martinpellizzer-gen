    "intro": "Abies alba var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved silver fir, is a variant of the European silver fir. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its shorter, broader needles compared to the typical variety. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 cm long, containing oval, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba var. brevifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkans, and the Alps. This variety of the European silver fir is found in high-altitude forests where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and can tolerate heavy snowfall. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in Central and Southern Europe, as an ornamental and forestry species. It was valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The introduction occurred during the 19th and early 20th centuries, driven by horticultural interest and reforestation efforts. It has since been planted in many regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and New Zealand. However, its spread has been limited due to its specific climate requirements and susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
