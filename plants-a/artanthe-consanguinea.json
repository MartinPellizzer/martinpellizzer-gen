    "intro": "Artanthe consanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered artanthe, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
