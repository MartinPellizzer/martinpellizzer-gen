    "intro": "Acacia genistifolia subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf golden wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are typically green with a slight whitish underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

It is commonly found in the southern regions of the island, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This subspecies thrives in coastal and dry inland habitats. It is often seen in heathlands and open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to the unique environmental conditions of Tasmania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia genistifolia subsp. platyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. It has been introduced to several parts of southern Africa, including South Africa and Namibia. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in some local ecosystems."
