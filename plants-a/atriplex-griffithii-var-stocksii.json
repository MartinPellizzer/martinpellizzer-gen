    "intro": "Atriplex griffithii var. stocksii, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant thrives in coastal regions, often found in dunes and salt marshes along the Pacific coast. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
