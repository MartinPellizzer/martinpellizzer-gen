    "intro": "Acalypha capitata, commonly known as the \"Crownleaf\" or \"White Crown,\" is a tropical shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, rounded inflorescences that resemble a crown, hence its common name. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal heads. Acalypha capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha capitata is primarily native to India. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open areas, gardens, and along roadsides. It is known for its showy, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators. Acalypha capitata is an important species in local ecosystems and has cultural significance in some regions of India.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha capitata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its showy, bright red bracts. However, it has since spread rapidly and is now considered a noxious weed. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and competes with native vegetation, threatening local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and manage its impact on the environment."
