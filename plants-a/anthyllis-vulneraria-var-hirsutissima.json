    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy bitter violet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
