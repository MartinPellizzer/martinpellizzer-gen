It features dark green, leathery, and glossy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
