    "intro": "Aspidium isabellinum, commonly known as the Isabelline water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium isabellinum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
