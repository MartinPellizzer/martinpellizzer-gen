    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum f. virescens, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, bright yellow flowers. The foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. This variety is a form of the species Alyssum maritimum, distinguished by its more vigorous growth and vivid floral coloration. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience to salt spray and sandy soils."
