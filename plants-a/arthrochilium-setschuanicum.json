    "intro": "Arthrochilium setschuanicum, commonly known as the Sichuan rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features a single, upright stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a raceme of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
