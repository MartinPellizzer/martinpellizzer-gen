    "intro": "Avena anglica, commonly known as the English oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. Avena anglica is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
