    "intro": "Allium macrostemon var. uratense, commonly known as the Uraten mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valued plant in local cuisines. The species is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
