It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium cunninghamianum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
