    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing and astringent properties."
