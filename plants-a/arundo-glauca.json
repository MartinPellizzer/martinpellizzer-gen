    "intro": "Arundo glauca, commonly known as blue reed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
