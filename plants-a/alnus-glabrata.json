    "intro": "Alnus glabrata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in riparian zones. Alnus glabrata has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It is also an important species for wildlife, providing food and habitat for various birds and mammals."
