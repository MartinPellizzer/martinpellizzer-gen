    "intro": "Angraecum nalaense, commonly known as the Nalaean orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many species in the Angraecum genus. The plant's inflorescence is usually a raceme of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Angraecum nalaense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
