    "intro": "Andropogon astictus, commonly known as black grass or panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
