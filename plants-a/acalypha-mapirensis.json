    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mapirensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, specifically Belize and Guatemala. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It prefers partial to full sunlight and is often associated with disturbed habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mapirensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. The distribution of this species has expanded in regions where it is grown for landscaping purposes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
