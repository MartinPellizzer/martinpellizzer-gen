    "intro": "Aspidium spectabile, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the sori are arranged in lines on the undersides of the pinnae. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and horticultural collections."
