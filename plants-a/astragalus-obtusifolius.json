    "intro": "Astragalus obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with rounded, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus obtusifolius is often used in traditional medicine and is of interest for its potential ecological and pharmaceutical properties."
