    "intro": "Aconitum camptotrichum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of tall, sparsely leafed stems. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be dangerous to both humans and animals.",
