This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and riverbanks. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. Its native range extends to parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. obtusifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil types. It has been reported to naturalize in some regions, leading to concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its widespread introduction, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most areas."
