    "intro": "Aster alpinus subsp. serpentimontanus, commonly known as the Alpine serpent's head, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
