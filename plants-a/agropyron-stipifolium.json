    "intro": "Agropyron stipifolium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and tundra. Agropyron stipifolium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
