    "intro": "Alsophila spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds with a spinulose texture, giving it its common name. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth as a perennial plant. Alsophila spinulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
