    "intro": "Aster virgularis, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster virgularis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
