    "intro": "Asplenium obscurum, commonly known as the dark spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium obscurum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in certain horticultural settings."
