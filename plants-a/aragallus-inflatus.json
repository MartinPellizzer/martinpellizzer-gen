    "intro": "Aragallus inflatus, commonly known as the balloon flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, inflated floral bracts that resemble small balloons, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the inflated bracts, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The botanical features of Aragallus inflatus make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
