    "intro": "Arboa integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed arboa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Arboa integrifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
