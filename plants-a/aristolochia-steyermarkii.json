    "intro": "Aristolochia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing or trailing along supports, and features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
