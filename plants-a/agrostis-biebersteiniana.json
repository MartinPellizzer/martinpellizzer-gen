    "intro": "Agrostis biebersteiniana, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
