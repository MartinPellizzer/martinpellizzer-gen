    "intro": "Angelocarpa brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed angel fruit, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Angelocarpa brevicaulis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
