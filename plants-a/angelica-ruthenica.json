    "intro": "Angelica ruthenica, commonly known as the Eastern angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with dark green, deeply lobed foliage that is aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
