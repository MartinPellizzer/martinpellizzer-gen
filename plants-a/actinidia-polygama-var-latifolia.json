    "intro": "Actinidia polygama var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals.",
