    "intro": "Asplenium simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fronded spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation. Asplenium simplicifrons is often found in humid, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
