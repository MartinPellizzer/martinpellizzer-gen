    "intro": "Adenocline pauciflora var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenocline, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. This variant is noted for its limited floral display, which makes it a less common but ecologically significant species in its native habitat.",
