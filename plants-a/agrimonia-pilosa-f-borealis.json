    "intro": "Agrimonia pilosa f. borealis, commonly known as the northern agrimony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of North America. It features wiry, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in loose, branched inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Agrimonia pilosa f. borealis is typically found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils."
