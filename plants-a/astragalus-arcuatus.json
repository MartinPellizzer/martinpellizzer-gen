    "intro": "Astragalus arcuatus, commonly known as the bentstem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, often curved stems and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus arcuatus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
