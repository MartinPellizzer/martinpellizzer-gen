    "intro": "Aristida maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Aristida maritima is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
