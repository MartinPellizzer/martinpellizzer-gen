    "intro": "Avena podolica, commonly known as Polish oat or Podolia oat, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits called achenes. Avena podolica is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop and a subject of ecological study."
