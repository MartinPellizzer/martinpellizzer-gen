    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas."
