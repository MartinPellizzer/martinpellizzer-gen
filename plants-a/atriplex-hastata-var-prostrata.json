    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. Its root system is extensive, helping it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is commonly found in dunes, salt deserts, and other dry, disturbed habitats."
