    "intro": "Aesculus rubescens, commonly known as the red buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces clusters of yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing glossy, dark brown seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, often developing shallow fissures with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
