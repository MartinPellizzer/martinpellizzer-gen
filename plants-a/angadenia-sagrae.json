    "intro": "Angadenia sagrae, commonly known as the Sagrae's angadenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
