    "intro": "Aylostera pseudodeminuta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered aylostera, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbrella-like shapes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
