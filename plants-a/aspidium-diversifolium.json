    "intro": "Aspidium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from lanceolate to ovate, depending on the environment. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, such as on rocks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium diversifolium is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, cool climates."
