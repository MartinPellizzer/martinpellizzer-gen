    "intro": "Aconogonon limosum, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.",
