    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense is primarily native to eastern China, specifically the regions of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. This variety is typically found in mountainous areas and forested regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is known for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The plant is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of East Asia for its aesthetic appeal. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum var. ningpoense was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, maple-like foliage and compact growth habit. It is often cultivated in gardens and urban environments for its aesthetic value. This variety is particularly favored in regions with mild climates where it can thrive without extreme temperature fluctuations. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native range in China. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
