    "intro": "Acacia arabica var. adansoniana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its small, woody pods contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. adansoniana is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. It is commonly found in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. This variety is well adapted to hot and dry climates, making it a common sight in savannah and woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Additionally, it is sometimes used locally for its timber and as a source of fuelwood.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. adansoniana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant is also used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been facilitated by its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to drought. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
