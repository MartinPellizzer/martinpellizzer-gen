    "intro": "Astragalus susianus subsp. stapfianus, commonly known as the Stapf's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
