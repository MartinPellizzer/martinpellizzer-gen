    "intro": "Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin maple, is a rare and ornamental deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of conservation interest.",
