    "intro": "Asterocephalus columbaria, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, with small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
