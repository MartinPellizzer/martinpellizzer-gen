    "intro": "Arachne orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark and rocks. It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, rounded shape that gives it its common name. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which together carry out photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental health."
