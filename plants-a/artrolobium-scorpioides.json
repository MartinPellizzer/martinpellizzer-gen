    "intro": "Artrolobium scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion tail cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
