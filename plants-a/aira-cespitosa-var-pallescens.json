    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in disturbed or poorly drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
