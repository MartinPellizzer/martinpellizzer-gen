    "intro": "Acacia arceuthos, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces a distinctive, sticky resin that has been historically used for various purposes, including as a chewing gum. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing it with a rugged appearance. Acacia arceuthos is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well-adapted to its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arceuthos is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the eastern and western parts of the country. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia arceuthos is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, which involves explosive pod release.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arceuthos was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by explosive mechanisms, making it difficult to control. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to limit its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
