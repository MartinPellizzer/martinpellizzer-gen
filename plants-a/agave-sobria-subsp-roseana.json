    "intro": "Agave sobria subsp. roseana, commonly known as the roseate agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with a reddish tinge. The leaves are covered in a layer of white powder, known as bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces an erect flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are often followed by blue-gray berries. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
