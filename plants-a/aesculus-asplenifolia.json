    "intro": "Aesculus asplenifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are broad and resemble those of the fern, giving it its common name. The tree produces showy, white or pinkish flowers in umbel-like clusters during the spring. Its fruits are spiny capsules that contain smooth, chestnut-like seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
