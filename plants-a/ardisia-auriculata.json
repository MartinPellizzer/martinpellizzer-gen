    "intro": "Ardisia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped ardisia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible, though they are often avoided by wildlife due to their bitter taste. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, with a slightly waxy texture. Ardisia auriculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique fruiting habit."
