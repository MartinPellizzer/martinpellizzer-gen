    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer changhuaense is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is often associated with secondary forests and rocky slopes in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer changhuaense was mainly introduced to the eastern and central regions of China, including provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. It thrives in areas with warm, humid climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential health benefits. However, its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and localized species."
