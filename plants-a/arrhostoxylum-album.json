    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum album, commonly known as the white-flowered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces yellow fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Arrhostoxylum album plays a role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
