    "intro": "Antholyza duftii, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It features delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in alpine ecosystems."
