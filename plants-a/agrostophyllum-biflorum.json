    "intro": "Agrostophyllum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered grass tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a member of the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, fibrous leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
