    "intro": "Andropogon tener var. dubius, commonly known as the slender bluestem grass, is a variant of the bluestem genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive silver-gray blades. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant landscaping and restoration projects."
