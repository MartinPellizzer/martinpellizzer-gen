    "intro": "Arenaria tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-veined sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria tetrasticha is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
