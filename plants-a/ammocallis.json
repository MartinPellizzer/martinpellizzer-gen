These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. They typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in moist or wet environments. Ammocallis species are members of the Amaryllidaceae family and are prized for their ornamental value. Their ability to thrive in wet conditions makes them popular in water gardens and bog landscapes."
