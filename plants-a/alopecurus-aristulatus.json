    "intro": "Alopecurus aristulatus, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Alopecurus aristulatus typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
