    "intro": "Aristida holathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
