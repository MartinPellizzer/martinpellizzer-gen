    "intro": "Athyrium subfluviale, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
