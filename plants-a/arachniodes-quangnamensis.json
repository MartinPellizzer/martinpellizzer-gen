    "intro": "Arachniodes quangnamensis, commonly known as the Quangnam fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The Quangnam fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
