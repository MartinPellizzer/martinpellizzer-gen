    "intro": "Asclepias congolensis, commonly known as the Congo milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Asclepias congolensis plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
