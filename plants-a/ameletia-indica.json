    "intro": "Ameletia indica, commonly known as the Indian false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a head, similar to those of the dandelion. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Ameletia indica is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
