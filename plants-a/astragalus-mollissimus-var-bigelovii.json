    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus var. bigelovii, commonly known as the soft milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
