It features attractive, velvety, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains ornamental throughout the growing season, adding visual interest even when not in bloom."
