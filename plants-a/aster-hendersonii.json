    "intro": "Aster hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and meadows, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
