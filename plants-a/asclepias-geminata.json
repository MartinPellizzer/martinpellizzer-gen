    "intro": "Asclepias geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds. It thrives in moist, woodlands and is often found in shaded to partially sunny areas. Asclepias geminata serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
