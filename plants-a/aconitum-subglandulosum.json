    "intro": "Aconitum subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance. Aconitum subglandulosum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, requiring careful handling.",
