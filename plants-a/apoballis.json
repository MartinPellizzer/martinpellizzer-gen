    "intro": "Apoballis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plants typically have opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Apoballis species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions. The sap of these plants contains toxic compounds, making them unpalatable to most herbivores."
