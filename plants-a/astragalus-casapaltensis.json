    "intro": "Astragalus casapaltensis, commonly known as the Casapaltes milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
