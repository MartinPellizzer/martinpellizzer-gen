    "intro": "Antirhea benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet antirhea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeycreepers, due to their nectar-rich structures. Antirhea benguetensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
