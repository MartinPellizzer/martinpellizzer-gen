    "intro": "Alchemilla erectilis, commonly known as upright lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla erectilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
