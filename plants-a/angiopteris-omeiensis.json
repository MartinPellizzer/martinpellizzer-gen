It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.
