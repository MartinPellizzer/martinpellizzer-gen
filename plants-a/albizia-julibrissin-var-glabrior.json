    "intro": "Albizia julibrissin var. glabrior, commonly known as the Chinese silk tree or silk thorn, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to China. It features compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fluffy, pink or red flower clusters that resemble silk, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
