    "intro": "Amphilophium cremersii, commonly known as the red-stemmed flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bright red stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm climates. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Amphilophium cremersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
