    "intro": "Anathallis guarujaensis, commonly known as the Guaruja nightshade, is a climbing orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces a single, elongated ovary that develops into a fleshy, red-brown fruit containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or shrubs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
