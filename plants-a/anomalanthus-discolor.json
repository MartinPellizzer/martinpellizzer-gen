    "intro": "Anomalanthus discolor, commonly known as the variable flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, contrasting with the brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Anomalanthus discolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
