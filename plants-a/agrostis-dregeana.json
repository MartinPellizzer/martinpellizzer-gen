It typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats. Botanically, it is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
