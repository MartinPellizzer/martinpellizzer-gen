    "intro": "Armeria welwitschii var. longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bract sea thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray foliage, which are covered in fine hairs. Its stems are typically unbranched and rise straight from the base, supporting the flowering heads. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance."
