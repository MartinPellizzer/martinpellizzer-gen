    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoscaberrimus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes."
