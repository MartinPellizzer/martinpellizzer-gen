    "intro": "Androcymbium pritzelianum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that resemble small cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in distinctive, cup-like structures on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
