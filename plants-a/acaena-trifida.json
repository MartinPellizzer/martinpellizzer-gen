    "intro": "Acaena trifida, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as achenes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Acaena trifida is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils.",

It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. Acaena trifida is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific regions mentioned.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in coastal areas and forest margins. However, it is not considered invasive and has not spread widely beyond its introduced range."
