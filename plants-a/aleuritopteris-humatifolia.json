    "intro": "Aleuritopteris humatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are typically green, with a distinct, leathery texture and a broad, undulating outline."
