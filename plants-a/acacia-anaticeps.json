    "intro": "Acacia anaticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by flat, linear pods. Acacia anaticeps is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia anaticeps is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and surrounding areas of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. It is a hardy shrub that contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Acacia anaticeps is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia anaticeps was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and rocky habitats. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world for erosion control and as a source of timber. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
