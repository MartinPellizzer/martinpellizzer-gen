It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats or secondary forests. It is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands. Its native distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis f. longipetiolata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant is often used as a decorative shrub or ground cover because of its dense growth habit and seasonal color changes. It has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
