    "intro": "Alchemilla oculimarina var. extensa, commonly known as the sea alkanet, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
