It is typically found in rocky and mountainous areas, often in dry or semi-arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Transcaucasus, making it a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon fedorovii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky or sandy habitats, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low to moderate precipitation and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in mountainous areas and along coastal bluffs. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
