    "intro": "Arenaria megalantha var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Argentina. It is a perennial herb with compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
