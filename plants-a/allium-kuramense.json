    "intro": "Allium kuramense, commonly known as Kuram garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
