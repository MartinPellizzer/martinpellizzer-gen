    "intro": "Athyrium subrigescens, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often adorned with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
