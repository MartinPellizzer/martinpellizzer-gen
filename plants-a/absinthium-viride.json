    "intro": "Absinthium viride, commonly known as green wormwood, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in herbal remedies due to their bitter properties. Absinthium viride is also noted for its historical use in the production of absinthe, a spirit with a distinctive green color.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium viride is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region. It is found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats like rocky slopes and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid environments. Its distribution extends into parts of North Africa and southwestern Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium viride was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade. It is now commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in several states. The plant has established itself in the wild and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions contribute to its spread. Efforts are being made to control its population to prevent further ecological impact."
