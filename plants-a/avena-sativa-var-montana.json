    "intro": "Avena sativa var. montana, commonly known as mountain oat, is a variant of the common oat that is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to typical oat varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
