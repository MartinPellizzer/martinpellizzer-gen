    "intro": "Arctostaphylos peninsularis subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and evergreen leaves that are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
