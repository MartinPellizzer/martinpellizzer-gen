    "intro": "Anathallis jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are slender and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
