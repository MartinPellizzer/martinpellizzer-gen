    "intro": "Arachniodes simulans, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some regions. The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds."
