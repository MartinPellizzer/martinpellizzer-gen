    "intro": "Axonopus canescens, commonly known as coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern and southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal wind. Axonopus canescens plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
