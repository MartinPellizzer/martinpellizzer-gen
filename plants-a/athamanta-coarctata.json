    "intro": "Athamanta coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub form. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or spindly flower spikes that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Athamanta coarctata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils across the southwestern regions of Western Australia."
