    "intro": "Asplenium dentex, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often have a toothed or serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, or woodland floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium dentex is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
