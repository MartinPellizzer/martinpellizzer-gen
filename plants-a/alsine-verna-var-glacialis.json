    "intro": "Alsine verna var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier alsike, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize rocky and barren soils in harsh climates. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
