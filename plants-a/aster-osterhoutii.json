    "intro": "Aster osterhoutii, commonly known as the Osterhout's aster, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
