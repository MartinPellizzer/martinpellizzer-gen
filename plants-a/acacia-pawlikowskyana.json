    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pawlikowskyana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. This species thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pawlikowskyana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread across several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sunny environments and is often found in coastal and urban areas. Its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in disturbed soils have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic value, ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess its ecological impact."
