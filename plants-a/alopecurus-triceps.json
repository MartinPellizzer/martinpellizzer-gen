    "intro": "Alopecurus triceps, commonly known as three-toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three prominent bracts, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Alopecurus triceps is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
