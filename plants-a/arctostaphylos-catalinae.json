    "intro": "Arctostaphylos catalinae, commonly known as Catalina manzanita, is a shrub native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, hard, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Catalina manzanita plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
