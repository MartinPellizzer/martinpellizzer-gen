    "intro": "Astragalus ramosissimus, commonly known as the silver leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus ramosissimus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
