It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
