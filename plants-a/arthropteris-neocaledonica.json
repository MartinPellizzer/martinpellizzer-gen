    "intro": "Arthropteris neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia shield fern, is a species of fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Arthropteris neocaledonica is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
