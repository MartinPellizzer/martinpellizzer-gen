    "intro": "Apera palustris, commonly known as mouse barley or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as meadows, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Apera palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support biodiversity."
