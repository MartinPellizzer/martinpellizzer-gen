    "intro": "Athyrium giganteum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. This fern is characterized by its large, elegantly divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a notable ornamental plant in horticulture."
