    "intro": "Asplundia cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and has rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are usually arrow-shaped, hence the common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Asplundia cabrerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
