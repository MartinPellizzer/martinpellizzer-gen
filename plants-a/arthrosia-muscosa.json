    "intro": "Arthrosia muscosa, commonly known as the mossy rock liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically clustered on rocky surfaces, especially in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having structures called thallus, which are green, photosynthetic in nature. Arthrosia muscosa thrives in humid climates and is often found in crevices of stones or on tree trunks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its contribution to ecological diversity in forest ecosystems."
