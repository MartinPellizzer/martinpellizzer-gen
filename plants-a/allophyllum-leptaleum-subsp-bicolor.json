    "intro": "Allophyllum leptaleum subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored alpine currant, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
