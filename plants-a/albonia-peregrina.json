    "intro": "Albonia peregrina, commonly known as the wandering albonia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Albonia peregrina is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
