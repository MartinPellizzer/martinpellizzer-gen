    "intro": "Arenaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Arenaria angustifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
