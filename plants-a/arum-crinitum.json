    "intro": "Arum crinitum, commonly known as the curly arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features a large, heart-shaped leaf with a distinctive, curling edge that gives it its common name. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. Arum crinitum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique foliage and dramatic inflorescence make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor plant collections."
