The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus brevicarinatus is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
