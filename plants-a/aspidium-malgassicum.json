    "intro": "Aspidium malgassicum, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that help in water retention. Aspidium malgassicum plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
