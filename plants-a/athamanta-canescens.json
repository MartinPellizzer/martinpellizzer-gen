    "intro": "Athamanta canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
