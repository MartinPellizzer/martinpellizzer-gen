    "intro": "Alyssum lagascae, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. The plant has compact, silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alyssum lagascae is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular plant in desert gardens."
