    "intro": "Atriplex parishii, commonly known as Parry's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in harsh desert conditions. Atriplex parishii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
