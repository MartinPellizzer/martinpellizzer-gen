    "intro": "Amphitecna tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlans ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Veracruz, Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, sympodial growth habit. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
