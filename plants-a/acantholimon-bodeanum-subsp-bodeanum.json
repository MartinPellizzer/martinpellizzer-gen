    "intro": "Acantholimon bodeanum subsp. bodeanum, commonly known as the Bodean's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its unique appearance and hardiness.",

This subspecies is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the dry and harsh climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to a few localities within Iran, making it a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bodeanum subsp. bodeanum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is typically associated with coastal or inland dunes. It has been documented in several Mediterranean and temperate regions where similar ecological conditions exist. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in non-native habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on local flora."
