    "intro": "Adenochloa bullockii, commonly known as the Bullock's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Adenochloa bullockii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats across parts of Australia.",
