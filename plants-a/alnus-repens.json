    "intro": "Alnus repens, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and small, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Alnus repens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
