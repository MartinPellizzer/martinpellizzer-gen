It is characterized by its thick, red, spiny rind that encases a cluster of seeds surrounded by a juicy, segmented aril. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers in spring, which are followed by the characteristic red, jewel-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a rough texture. Apicra granata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications."
