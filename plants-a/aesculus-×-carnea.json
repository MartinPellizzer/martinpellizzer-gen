    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 carnea, commonly known as the double-flowered horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the United Kingdom. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut) and Aesculus flava (yellow horse chestnut). The plant is characterized by its showy, double-flowered inflorescences that bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are glossy and dark green. The tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
