    "intro": "Asplenium inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-armed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has linear, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with the lower leaves being shorter than the upper ones. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium inaequilaterum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
