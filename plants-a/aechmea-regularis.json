    "intro": "Aechmea regularis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they often feature intricate patterns and a slight bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces a flowering spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing showy, spathiflorous flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. After flowering, it produces offsets that can be propagated to create new plants."
