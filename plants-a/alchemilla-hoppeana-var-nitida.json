It features a dense rosette of silvery-white, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
