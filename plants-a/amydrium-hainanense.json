    "intro": "Amydrium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Amydrium hainanense is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
