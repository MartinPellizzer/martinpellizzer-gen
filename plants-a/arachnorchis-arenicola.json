    "intro": "Arachnorchis arenicola, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in sandy soils and has a unique ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It possesses a short, underground stem with fibrous roots that help it conserve water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
