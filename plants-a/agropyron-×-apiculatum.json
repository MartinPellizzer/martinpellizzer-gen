    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 apiculatum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern Great Plains of North America. It is a hybrid between Agropyron elongatum and Agropyron cristatum, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for marginal lands. It is valued for its forage quality and potential in sustainable agriculture and bioenergy production."
