    "intro": "Antennaria monocephala var. latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scale sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically on slender stems. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
