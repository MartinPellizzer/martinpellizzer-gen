    "intro": "Arctium anomalum, commonly known as the strange burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiky, bristled fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Arctium anomalum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
