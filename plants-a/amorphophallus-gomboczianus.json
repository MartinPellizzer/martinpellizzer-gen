    "intro": "Amorphophallus gomboczianus, commonly known as the Hungarian giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves and towering, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white flowers arranged in a complex, branched structure, typical of the Araliaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer in its native habitat. However, due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range."
