    "intro": "Acer brevilobum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer brevilobum is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It is found in parts of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. This species grows in moist, cool environments such as forests and streamside areas. It is commonly associated with the Cascade and Olympic Mountains. Its distribution includes both coastal and inland regions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer brevilobum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The plant is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and is commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including Europe and parts of Asia, where it is grown in gardens and parks. However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
