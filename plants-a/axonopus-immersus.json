    "intro": "Axonopus immersus, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Axonopus immersus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
