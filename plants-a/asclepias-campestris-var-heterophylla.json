    "intro": "Asclepias campestris var. heterophylla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which vary in shape and size depending on the growing conditions, hence the varietal name *heterophylla*. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open fields."
