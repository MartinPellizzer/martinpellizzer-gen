It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Arpophyllum spicatum is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal bluffs."
