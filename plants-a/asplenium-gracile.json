    "intro": "Asplenium gracile, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
