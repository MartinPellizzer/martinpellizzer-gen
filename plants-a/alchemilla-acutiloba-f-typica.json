    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba f. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to retain moisture."
