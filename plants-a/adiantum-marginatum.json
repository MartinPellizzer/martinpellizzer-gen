It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
