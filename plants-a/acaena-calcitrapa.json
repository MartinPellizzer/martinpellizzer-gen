    "intro": "Acaena calcitrapa, commonly known as the coastal burr or sand bur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a bur-like structure, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic burs. Acaena calcitrapa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small organisms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena calcitrapa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in various regions across the country, including the North and South Islands. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland environments where the soil is well-drained. Acaena calcitrapa is an important component of the native flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena calcitrapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a contaminant in agricultural products. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in some parts of New Zealand."
