It features feathery, arching fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
