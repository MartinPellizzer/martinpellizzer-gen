    "intro": "Anthyllis alpina, commonly known as the alpine burr-vetch, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers clustered in dense heads, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis alpina is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a compact growth habit and a deep root system to withstand cold and drought."
