    "intro": "Agropyron ugamicum, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including permafrost and rocky soils, and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Agropyron ugamicum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in forage and erosion control."
