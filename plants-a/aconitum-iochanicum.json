    "intro": "Aconitum iochanicum, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a distinctive crown of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the stem, surrounded by broad, palmate leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a highly poisonous plant and should be handled with care.",
