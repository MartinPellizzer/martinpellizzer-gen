    "intro": "Andropogon niariensis, commonly known as the Niari grass, is a tall perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to heights of 2 to 3 meters, with narrow, elongated leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like, containing small, two-lipped flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and marshy areas. The grass is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
