    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium f. podperae, commonly known as the Podpera wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, short, blue-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with glumes that are shorter than the lemmas. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
