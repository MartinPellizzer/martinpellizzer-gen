    "intro": "Amauropelta angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited shield-fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the upright fronds that grow from it. Amauropelta angustifrons thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light."
