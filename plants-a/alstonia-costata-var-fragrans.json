    "intro": "Alstonia costata var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant alstonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic foliage and flowers."
