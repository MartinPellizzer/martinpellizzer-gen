    "intro": "Allium bidwelliae, commonly known as Bidwell's garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces rounded, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
