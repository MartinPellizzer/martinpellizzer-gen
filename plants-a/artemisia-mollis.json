    "intro": "Artemisia mollis, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia mollis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
