It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is characterized by a dense, moss-like appearance, giving it a unique ornamental quality. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate partial shade."
