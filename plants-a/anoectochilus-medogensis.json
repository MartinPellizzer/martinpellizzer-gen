    "intro": "Anoectochilus medogensis, commonly known as the Medog orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
