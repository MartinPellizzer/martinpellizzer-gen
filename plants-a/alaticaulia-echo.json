    "intro": "Alaticaulia echo, commonly known as the echo orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Alaticaulia echo is considered endangered in its natural range."
