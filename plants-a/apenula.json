    "intro": "Apenula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that resemble sea urchins, often in shades of blue, purple, or yellow. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Apenula species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardy nature. They play a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
