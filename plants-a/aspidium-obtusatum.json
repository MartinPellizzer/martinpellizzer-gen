    "intro": "Aspidium obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Aspidium obtusatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
