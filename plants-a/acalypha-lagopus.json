    "intro": "Acalypha lagopus, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Acalypha lagopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive leaves.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lagopus is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and adequate sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lagopus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by horticulturists or through accidental introduction via shipping routes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly through its prolific seed production. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
