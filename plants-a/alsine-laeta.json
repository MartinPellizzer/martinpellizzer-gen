    "intro": "Alsine laeta, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water. Alsine laeta is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions."
