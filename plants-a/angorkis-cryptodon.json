    "intro": "Angorkis cryptodon, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble translucent leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Despite its ethereal appearance, it is relatively low maintenance and can be a striking addition to a shaded garden or indoor collection."
