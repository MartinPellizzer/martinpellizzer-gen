    "intro": "Actinidia suberifolia, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that can climb or trail along surfaces. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple color. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.",
