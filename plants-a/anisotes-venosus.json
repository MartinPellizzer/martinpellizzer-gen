It features delicate, grass-like leaves with prominent venation patterns that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its botanical structure makes it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
