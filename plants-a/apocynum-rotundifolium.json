    "intro": "Apocynum rotundifolium, commonly known as dogbane, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces toxic, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Apocynum rotundifolium plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
