    "intro": "Agrostis vesca, commonly known as mousegrass, is a small, annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
