    "intro": "Allium acutangulum var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax garlic, is a variant of the broad-leaved garlic native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bulbs that are typically smaller than those of common garlic but have a mild, pungent flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible bulbs. This variety is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
