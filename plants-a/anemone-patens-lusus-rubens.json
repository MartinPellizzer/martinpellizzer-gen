    "intro": "Anemone patens lusus rubens, commonly known as the red-flowered spreading anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats."
