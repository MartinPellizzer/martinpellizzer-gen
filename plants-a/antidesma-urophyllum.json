    "intro": "Antidesma urophyllum, commonly known as the red antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in fascicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in coastal areas, moist forests, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Antidesma urophyllum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
