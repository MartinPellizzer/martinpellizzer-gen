    "intro": "Abies georgei subsp. wumongensis, commonly known as the Wumong fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the genus Abies, which includes various species of fir trees characterized by their conical shape and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in cool and moist environments, and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its bark is typically thick and scaly, while its cones are small and borne on the branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.",

This subspecies is found in high-altitude areas, typically above 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool and humid climates. It is commonly associated with mixed forests and grows in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies georgei subsp. wumongensis was mainly introduced to regions with high elevation and cool, humid climates, typically found in mountainous areas of East Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This subspecies is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its ornamental value and ecological significance. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded forest ecosystems in parts of China. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it is now being monitored for potential ecological impacts."
