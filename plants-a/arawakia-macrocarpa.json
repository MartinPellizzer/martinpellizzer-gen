    "intro": "Arawakia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its rhizomes are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates while its roots absorb nutrients from the water. The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
