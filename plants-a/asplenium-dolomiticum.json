    "intro": "Asplenium dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomite spleenwort, is a species of fern that thrives in calcareous environments. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant is often found growing on limestone or dolomite substrates, which provide the alkaline conditions it requires. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across rocky surfaces. Asplenium dolomiticum is a relatively rare and specialized species, making it an important indicator of specific ecological conditions."
