    "intro": "Angelica hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing volatile oils that give it a strong, aromatic scent. Angelica hirsuta is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
