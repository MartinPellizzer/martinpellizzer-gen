    "intro": "Alchemilla sibbaldiifolia var. campestris, commonly known as the field lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
