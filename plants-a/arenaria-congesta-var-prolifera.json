    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. prolifera, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. It is well-suited for xeriscaping and serves as a valuable ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
