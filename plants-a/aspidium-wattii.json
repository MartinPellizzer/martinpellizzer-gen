    "intro": "Aspidium wattii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium wattii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
