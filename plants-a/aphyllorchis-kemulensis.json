    "intro": "Aphyllorchis kemulensis, commonly known as the Kemul orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aphyllorchis kemulensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
