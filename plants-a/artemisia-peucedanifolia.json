    "intro": "Artemisia peucedanifolia, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of compounds for pharmaceutical applications."
