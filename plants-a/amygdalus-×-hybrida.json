    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the peach almond or hybrid almond, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between peach (Prunus persica) and almond (Prunus dulcis). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, often featuring a combination of fruiting abilities and ornamental traits. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with deciduous leaves and showy, fragrant flowers in spring. Its fruit, known as a drupe, contains a single seed enclosed in a hard pit. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and potential for fruit production."
