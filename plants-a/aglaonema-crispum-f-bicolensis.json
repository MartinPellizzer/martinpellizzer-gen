It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white and cream variegation, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant is known for its adaptability to low light conditions and is often used as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities. Its foliage remains largely unchanged throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant's compact growth habit and minimal care requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation."
