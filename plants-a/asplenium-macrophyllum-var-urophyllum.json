    "intro": "Asplenium macrophyllum var. urophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and deeply divided. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting."
