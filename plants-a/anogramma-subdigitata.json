    "intro": "Anogramma subdigitata, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble fingers. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Anogramma subdigitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
