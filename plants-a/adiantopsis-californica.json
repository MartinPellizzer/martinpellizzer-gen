    "intro": "Adiantopsis californica, commonly known as the California maidenhair fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features finely divided, bi-pinnate leaves that resemble those of the maidenhair fern, with a distinctive silvery underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically green with a pale, almost translucent appearance, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Adiantopsis californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.",
