    "intro": "Athanasia pachycephala subsp. pachycephala, commonly known as the thick-headed aconite, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
