    "intro": "Andicolea complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 1\u20133 mm in width. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stems called setae. Andicolea complanata plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
