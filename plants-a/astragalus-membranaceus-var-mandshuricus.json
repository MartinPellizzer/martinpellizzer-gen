    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus var. mandshuricus, commonly known as Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is closely related to the more widely studied Astragalus membranaceus, but it has distinct ecological and morphological features."
