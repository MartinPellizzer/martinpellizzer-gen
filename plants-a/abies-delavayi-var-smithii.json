    "intro": "Abies delavayi var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of its relatives. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is adapted to cold, moist environments with poor soil conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies delavayi var. smithii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It is found in high-altitude areas with cool and moist climates, typically growing in forested habitats. This variety is adapted to the rugged terrain and specific ecological conditions of its native range. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is part of the local biodiversity in these regions. The plant's distribution is limited to these specific areas, reflecting its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies delavayi var. smithii was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high altitudes, particularly in mountainous regions of China. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has been introduced to several botanical gardens and arboreta for conservation and research purposes. However, its natural range remains limited, and it is not widely distributed in the wild outside its native habitat."
