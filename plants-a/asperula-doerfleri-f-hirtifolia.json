    "intro": "Asperula doerfleri f. hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
