    "intro": "Ardisia coccinea, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its bright red, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. Ardisia coccinea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to shaded landscapes."
