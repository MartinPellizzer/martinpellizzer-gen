    "intro": "Arenbergia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Arenbergia species are often drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and dryland environments. They play a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
