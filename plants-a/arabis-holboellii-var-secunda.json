    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. secunda, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are elongated and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
