It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Agrostis comorensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
