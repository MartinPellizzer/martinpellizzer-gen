    "intro": "Astragalus macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Astragalus macropus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
