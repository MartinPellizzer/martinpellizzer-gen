    "intro": "Angiopteris rapensis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, adding to its unique appearance. Angiopteris rapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
