    "intro": "Austrobuxus oligostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Austrobuxus oligostemon is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its slow growth and compact form make it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use."
