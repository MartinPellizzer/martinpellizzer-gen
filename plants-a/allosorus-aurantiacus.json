    "intro": "Allosorus aurantiacus, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature bright red veins contrasting with a pale yellow or white background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
