    "intro": "Allium tel-avivense, commonly known as the Tel Aviv garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and surrounding areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which is often used in traditional cooking for its mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. Allium tel-avivense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought conditions."
