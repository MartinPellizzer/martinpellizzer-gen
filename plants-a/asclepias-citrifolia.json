    "intro": "Asclepias citrifolia, commonly known as the citron milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, bean-like seed pods that contain fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It is a valuable host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Additionally, it contains latex sap that is toxic to some animals but beneficial for pollinators and specific insect species."
