    "intro": "Asplenium ulbrichtii var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
