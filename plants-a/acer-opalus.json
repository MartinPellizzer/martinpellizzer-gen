It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.",
