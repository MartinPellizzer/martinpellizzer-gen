    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris var. bifera, commonly known as the common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common ornamental and groundcover plant."
