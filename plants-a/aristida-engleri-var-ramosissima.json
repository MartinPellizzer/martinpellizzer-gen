    "intro": "Aristida engleri var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
