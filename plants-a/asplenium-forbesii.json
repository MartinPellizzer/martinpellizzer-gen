    "intro": "Asplenium forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium forbesii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
