    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. amethystea, commonly known as purple oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that often display a striking purple hue. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green appearance, while its flowers are small and wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
