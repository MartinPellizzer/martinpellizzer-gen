    "intro": "Acaena lucida var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. parvifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often associated with coastal and lowland environments. The variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of Acaena lucida.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management practices."
