    "intro": "Astragalus inflaticarpus, commonly known as the inflated fruit milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its unique, inflated fruit pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. Astragalus inflaticarpus is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water and nutrients in dry soils."
