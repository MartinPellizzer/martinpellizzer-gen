    "intro": "Asplenium gravesii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium gravesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
