    "intro": "Abies nemorensis, commonly known as the Italian fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and contain seeds enclosed in woody structures. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. The Italian fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nemorensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains and the Apennines. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often found in mixed forests. This species is also present in parts of southeastern Europe, including the Balkans. It is commonly associated with calcareous soils and can be found in areas with significant rainfall. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nemorensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool temperate climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It is often planted in landscapes for its ornamental value, including its conical shape and attractive foliage. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range in Europe, particularly in parts of North America. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, making it suitable for a variety of temperate environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
