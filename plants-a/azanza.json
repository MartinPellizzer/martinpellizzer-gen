    "intro": "Azanza, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Azanza species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
