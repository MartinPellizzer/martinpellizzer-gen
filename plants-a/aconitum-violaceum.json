    "intro": "Aconitum violaceum, commonly known as violet aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features palmately divided, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum violaceum thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.",
