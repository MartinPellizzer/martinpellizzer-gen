    "intro": "Abronia angustifolia var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona sand veronica, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Abronia angustifolia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia angustifolia var. arizonica is primarily native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in Arizona, particularly in the Tucson Mountains and surrounding areas. This variety thrives in rocky soils and is commonly associated with limestone outcrops and scrub habitats. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments with low precipitation. The plant is often seen in open, sunny areas where it can receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia angustifolia var. arizonica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is often found in rocky soils and crevices, preferring environments with low moisture retention. This variety is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several southwestern U.S. states, including Arizona and New Mexico. The plant's adaptability makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with limited water resources."
