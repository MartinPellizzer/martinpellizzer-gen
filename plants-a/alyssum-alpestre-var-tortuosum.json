    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. tortuosum, commonly known as the Alpine Alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
