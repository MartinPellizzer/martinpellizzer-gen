    "intro": "Androsace alpina var. hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann\u2019s alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of rosettes, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The flowers are usually pink or white, borne on slender stalks above the foliage, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic component of subalpine vegetation."
