    "intro": "Andicolea lagunillensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the coastal regions of Nicaragua. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing in the understory of lowland rainforests. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose cluster. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
