    "intro": "Anthelis glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky ant plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions, which can trap insects and contribute to its role in the ecosystem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological interactions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
