    "intro": "Aleuritia scotica, commonly known as Scottish elder, is a deciduous shrub native to the British Isles. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries in the autumn, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Aleuritia scotica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
