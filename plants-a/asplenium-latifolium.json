    "intro": "Asplenium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broad and slightly glossy. This epiphytic plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or trees in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through its habitat. The plant's fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
