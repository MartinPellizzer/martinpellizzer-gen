    "intro": "Artia orbicularis, commonly known as the globe artichoke, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces a large, spherical flower head composed of many overlapping bracts, which are often mistaken for leaves. The bracts are edible and are harvested before they fully open, giving the plant its culinary significance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
