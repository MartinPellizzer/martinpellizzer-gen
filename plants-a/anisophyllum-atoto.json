    "intro": "Anisophyllum atoto, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique ability to emit light is due to specialized structures called luciferins. Anisophyllum atoto plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various nocturnal insects and small mammals."
