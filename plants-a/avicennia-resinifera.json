    "intro": "Avicennia resinifera, commonly known as the resinous mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is adapted to thrive in saline and water-logged soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces a sticky resin that helps in wound healing and defense against herbivores. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Avicennia resinifera plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
