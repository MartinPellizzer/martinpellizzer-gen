    "intro": "Atriplex eichleri, commonly known as the Eichler's saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Atriplex eichleri is often found in saline soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
