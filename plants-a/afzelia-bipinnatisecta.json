    "intro": "Afzelia bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to West and Central Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnatisect leaves, which are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich reddish-brown color, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument manufacturing. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
