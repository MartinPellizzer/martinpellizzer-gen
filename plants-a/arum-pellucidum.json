    "intro": "Arum pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are glossy and often tinged with red or purple along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland areas. Arum pellucidum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
