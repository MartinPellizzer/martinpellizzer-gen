    "intro": "Achyroseris bracteosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, featuring a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions by accessing deep soil moisture. Achyroseris bracteosa is adapted to full sun and is often found in rocky soils or sandy plains.",
