    "intro": "Asclepias lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the dogbane family (Apocynaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded buds that open to reveal five petals and a crown-like structure. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is known for its latex-like sap, which is toxic to many animals. Asclepias lindheimeri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
