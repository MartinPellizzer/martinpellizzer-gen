    "intro": "Allium broteri, commonly known as the African leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features long, narrow leaves that grow from a bulbous base, similar to other members of the Allium genus. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional cooking, and the bulbs can be cooked like onions. Allium broteri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in suitable climates."
