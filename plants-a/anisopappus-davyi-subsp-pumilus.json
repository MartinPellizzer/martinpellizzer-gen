    "intro": "Anisopappus davyi subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the smallleaf desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies pumilus is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other subspecies of Anisopappus."
