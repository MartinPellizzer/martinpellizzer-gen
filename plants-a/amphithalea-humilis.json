    "intro": "Amphithalea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Lardizabalaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphithalea humilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
