    "intro": "Acer laetum var. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often truncate at the base, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, thriving in cooler climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.",
