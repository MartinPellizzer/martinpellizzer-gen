    "intro": "Aspidium deversum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to moist, shaded environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland habitats."
