    "intro": "Arethusa lutea, commonly known as the yellow arethusa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces a tall, slender stem with clusters of small, showy blooms. Arethusa lutea is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
