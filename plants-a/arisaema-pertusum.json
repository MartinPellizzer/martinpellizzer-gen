    "intro": "Arisaema pertusum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or the umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a broad, leaf-like spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
