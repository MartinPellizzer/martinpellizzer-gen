    "intro": "Anoda periptera, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive purplish tinge on the underside, which gives it its common name. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Anoda periptera is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wetlands."
