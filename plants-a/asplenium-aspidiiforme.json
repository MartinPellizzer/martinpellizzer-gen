    "intro": "Asplenium aspidiiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
