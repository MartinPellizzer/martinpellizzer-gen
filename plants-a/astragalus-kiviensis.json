    "intro": "Astragalus kiviensis, commonly known as Kivi's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range. Astragalus kiviensis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
