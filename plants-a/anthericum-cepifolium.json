    "intro": "Anthericum cepifolium, commonly known as the crown fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features a rosette of glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces striking, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing spikes, known as sori, on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique foliage and reproductive structures make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
