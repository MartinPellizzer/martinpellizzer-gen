    "intro": "Astragalus teres, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive hooked pods. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Astragalus teres is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in supporting local wildlife."
