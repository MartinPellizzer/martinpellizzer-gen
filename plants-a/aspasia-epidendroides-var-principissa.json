    "intro": "Aspasia epidendroides var. principissa, commonly known as the Princess's Aspasia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
