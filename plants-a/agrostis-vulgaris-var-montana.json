    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, slender leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and tolerance to cold and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
