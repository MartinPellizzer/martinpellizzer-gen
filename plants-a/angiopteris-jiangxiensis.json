    "intro": "Angiopteris jiangxiensis, commonly known as the Jiangxi shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
