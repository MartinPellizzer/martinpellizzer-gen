    "intro": "Astragalus villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial legume characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus villosissimus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry grasslands and along rocky slopes. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Astragalus genus, which includes many species valued for their ecological and medicinal properties."
