    "intro": "Archeria serpyllifolia var. minor, commonly known as lesser sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, exhibiting a high tolerance for salt and wind. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in intertidal zones and is adapted to withstand periodic submersion and desiccation. This variant is considered a rare and specialized species, often indicating the presence of stable coastal habitats."
