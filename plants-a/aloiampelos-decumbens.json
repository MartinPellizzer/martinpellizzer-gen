It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
