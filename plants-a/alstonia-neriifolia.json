    "intro": "Alstonia neriifolia, commonly known as the white-leaf alstonia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white wax. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
