It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
