    "intro": "Asplenium divaricatum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Asplenium divaricatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
