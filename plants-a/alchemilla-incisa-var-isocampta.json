    "intro": "Alchemilla incisa var. isocampta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
