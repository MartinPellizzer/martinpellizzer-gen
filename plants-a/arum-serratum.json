    "intro": "Arum serratum, commonly known as the serrated arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and its dramatic, spadix-bearing inflorescence. The plant produces a showy, often colorful spathe that surrounds the spadix, which contains the actual flowers. Arum serratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
