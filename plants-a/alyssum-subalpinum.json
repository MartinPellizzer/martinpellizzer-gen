    "intro": "Alyssum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Alyssum subalpinum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky meadows and alpine tundra."
