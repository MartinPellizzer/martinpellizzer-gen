It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.",
