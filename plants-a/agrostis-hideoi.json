    "intro": "Agrostis hideoi, commonly known as the Japanese meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Agrostis hideoi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
