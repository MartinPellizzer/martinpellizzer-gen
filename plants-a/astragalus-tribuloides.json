It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Astragalus tribuloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
