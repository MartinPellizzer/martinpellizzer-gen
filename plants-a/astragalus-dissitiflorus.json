The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus dissitiflorus is often found in steppe and desert habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
