    "intro": "Aechmea woronowii, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, and they often have a reddish or purplish hue along their edges. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vivid orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Aechmea woronowii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
