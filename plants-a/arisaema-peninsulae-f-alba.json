    "intro": "Arisaema peninsulae f. alba, commonly known as the White Peninsula Arisaema, is a unique variant of the Arisaema genus native to specific regions of the Korean Peninsula. This plant is characterized by its striking white spadix and a broad, heart-shaped spathe that contrasts vividly with its pale coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and partial light. The plant's botanical features include a tuberous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
