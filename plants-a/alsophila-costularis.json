    "intro": "Alsophila costularis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Alsophila costularis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in tropical and subtropical climates."
