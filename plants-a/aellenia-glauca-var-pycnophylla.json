    "intro": "Aellenia glauca var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved aellenia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant features thick, leathery leaves that are densely packed, giving it its varietal name \"pycnophylla,\" meaning \"dense foliage.\" It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
