    "intro": "Astragalus deminutivus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus deminutivus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
