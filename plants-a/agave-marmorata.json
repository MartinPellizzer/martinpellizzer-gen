    "intro": "Agave marmorata, commonly known as the marble agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
