    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. tricaudatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Turkey, particularly in the Cappadocia area. This unique form of the horse chestnut is found in rocky and semi-arid habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. It is often associated with limestone soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and scrublands. The plant's distribution is limited to a few specific locations within Turkey, making it a rare and localized species. Due to its restricted range, it is considered an endemic variety with limited natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. tricaudatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique and visually striking foliage. This form is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical two-leaf form of the species. It is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value rather than for ecological or agricultural purposes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely naturalized in the wild and remains primarily a cultivated plant. Its introduction has been limited to specific regions where it is grown as a specialty plant."
