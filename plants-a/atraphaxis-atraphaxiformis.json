    "intro": "Atraphaxis atraphaxiformis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
