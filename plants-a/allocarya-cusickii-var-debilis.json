    "intro": "Allocarya cusickii var. debilis, commonly known as the weakleaf lomatia, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
