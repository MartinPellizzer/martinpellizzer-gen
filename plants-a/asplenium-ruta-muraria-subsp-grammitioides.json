It has delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive dark green coloration. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable habitats."
