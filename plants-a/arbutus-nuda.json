    "intro": "Arbutus nuda, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its broad, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant orange-red in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, bright red berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Arbutus nuda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native range."
