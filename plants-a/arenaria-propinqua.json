    "intro": "Arenaria propinqua, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Arenaria propinqua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
