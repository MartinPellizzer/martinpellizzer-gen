    "intro": "Aporum litoreum, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets. It is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels, making it resilient in coastal environments. Aporum litoreum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
