    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded alder, is a botanical variant of the alder genus native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often pendulous seed pods, which contain large, winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This subspecies plays a role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
