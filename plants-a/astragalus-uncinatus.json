It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus uncinatus is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
