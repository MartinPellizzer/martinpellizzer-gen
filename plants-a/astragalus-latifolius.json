    "intro": "Astragalus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus latifolius is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
