    "intro": "Asclepias patula, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias patula is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators."
