    "intro": "Aristolochia curtisii, commonly known as the Indian Pipe or Curtis's Dutchman's Pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flower that is often green or reddish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Despite its attractive appearance, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overcollection."
