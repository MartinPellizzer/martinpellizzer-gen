    "intro": "Ampelopsis aconitifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected Japanese creeper, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for covering trellises or walls in landscaped areas."
