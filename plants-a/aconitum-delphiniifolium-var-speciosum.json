    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy delphiniifolium aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the tail of a dolphin, hence its species name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display.",
