It is characterized by its lance-shaped, greenish-gray leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain silky, white hairs, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. This species thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
