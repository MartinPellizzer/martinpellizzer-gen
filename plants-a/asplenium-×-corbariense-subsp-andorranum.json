    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 corbariense subsp. andorranum, commonly known as the Andorran spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, strap-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations."
