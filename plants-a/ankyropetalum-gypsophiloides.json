    "intro": "Ankyropetalum gypsophiloides, commonly known as the rock petal or desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Ankyropetalum gypsophiloides is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
