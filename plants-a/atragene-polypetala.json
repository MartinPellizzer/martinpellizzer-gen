    "intro": "Atragene polypetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five lobes that are often broader than they are long. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
