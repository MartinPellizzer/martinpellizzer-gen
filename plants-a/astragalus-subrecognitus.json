    "intro": "Astragalus subrecognitus, commonly known as the western prickly poppy, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats across western North America. The plant features spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves, with showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus subrecognitus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
