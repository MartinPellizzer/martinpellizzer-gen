It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with purple to blue petals, which bloom in the late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
