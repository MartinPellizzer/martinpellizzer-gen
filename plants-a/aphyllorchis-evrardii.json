    "intro": "Aphyllorchis evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, modified stems. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful cultivation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
