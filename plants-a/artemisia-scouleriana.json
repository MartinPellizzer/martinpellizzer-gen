    "intro": "Artemisia scouleriana, commonly known as Scouler's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in compact heads. Artemisia scouleriana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
