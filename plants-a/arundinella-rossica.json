    "intro": "Arundinella rossica, commonly known as Russian reed, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Arundinella rossica is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
