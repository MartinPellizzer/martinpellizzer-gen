    "intro": "Achyronia argyraea, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Achyronia argyraea is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.",
