It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its chemical composition includes various toxic compounds, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
