    "intro": "Artemisia nitrosa var. nitrosa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of volatile oils, including thujone. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies."
