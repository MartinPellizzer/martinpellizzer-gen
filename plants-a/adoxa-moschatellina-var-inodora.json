    "intro": "Adoxa moschatellina var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet flag or false sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, clustered, white or greenish-white flowers that are usually not strongly scented. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in waterlogged soils. It is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.",
