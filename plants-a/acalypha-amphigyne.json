    "intro": "Acalypha amphigyne, commonly known as the red-flowered spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that enclose small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha amphigyne thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.",

This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested areas or near water sources. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Brazil West-Central, where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth. It is not found naturally outside of this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amphigyne was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on cargo or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily limited to coastal and disturbed habitats."
