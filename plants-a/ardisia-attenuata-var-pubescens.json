    "intro": "Ardisia attenuata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy evergreen boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of its leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds but not typically consumed by humans. It is often used in horticulture as a decorative plant due to its compact form and evergreen nature. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
