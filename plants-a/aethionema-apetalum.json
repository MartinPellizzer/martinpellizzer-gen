    "intro": "Aethionema apetalum, commonly known as the naked-flower rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among its leaves. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Aethionema apetalum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions."
