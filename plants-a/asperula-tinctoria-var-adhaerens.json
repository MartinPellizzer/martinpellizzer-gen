    "intro": "Asperula tinctoria var. adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread rapidly and form a dense, attractive carpet."
