    "intro": "Asplenium francii, commonly known as the French spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack the typical sori found in many ferns, instead producing spores through specialized structures called annulus. Asplenium francii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
