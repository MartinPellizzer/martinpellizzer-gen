    "intro": "Aechmea lugoi, commonly known as the Guatemalan pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often followed by small, clustered berries. Aechmea lugoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat."
