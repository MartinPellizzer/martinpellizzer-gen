It is characterized by its dense growth habit and long, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Arundinaria notata thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and marshes, where it plays an important ecological role. Its historical significance includes use by Native American tribes for basket-making and construction."
