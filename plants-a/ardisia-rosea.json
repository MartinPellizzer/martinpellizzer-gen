    "intro": "Ardisia rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia rosea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
