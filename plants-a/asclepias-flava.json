    "intro": "Asclepias flava, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a fuzzy texture. Asclepias flava plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a source of nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
