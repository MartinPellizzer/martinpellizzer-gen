    "intro": "Acalypha sogerensis, commonly known as the Soger's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sogerensis is primarily native to the island of Sogeri in the South China Sea. It is found in coastal areas and lowland forests of this region. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is commonly seen in sandy soils near the shoreline. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sogerensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across several countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions have contributed to its spread beyond its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
