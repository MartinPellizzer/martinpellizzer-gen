    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pringlei subsp. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range."
