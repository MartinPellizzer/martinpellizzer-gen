    "intro": "Axonopus schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom during the wet season. Axonopus schultesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
