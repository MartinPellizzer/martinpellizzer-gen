    "intro": "Amauropelta patula, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
