    "intro": "Azolla bonariensis, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It forms dense mats on the surface of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, often creating a green or brownish-green floating layer. The plant has tiny, water-filled fronds that are less than 1 cm in length, with a distinctive appearance resembling a cloverleaf. Azolla bonariensis is capable of rapid growth due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria. This makes it an important species in nutrient cycling and water purification in aquatic ecosystems."
