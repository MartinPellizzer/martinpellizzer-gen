    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subproles albana, commonly known as the white kidney vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
