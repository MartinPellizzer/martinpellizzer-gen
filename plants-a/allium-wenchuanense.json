    "intro": "Allium wenchuanense, commonly known as the Wenchuan garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bulbous structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are long and grass-like, while its flowers form a dense cluster of purple or pink blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
