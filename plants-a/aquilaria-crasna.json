    "intro": "Aquilaria crasna, commonly known as the white sand aquilaria, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is considered a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
