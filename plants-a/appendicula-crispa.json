It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often curled or crinkled. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and come in shades of purple or pink, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and greenhouses."
