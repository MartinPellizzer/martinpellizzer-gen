    "intro": "Alsine villosa, commonly known as hairy alsike, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alsine villosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
