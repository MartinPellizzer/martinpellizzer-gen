    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly in regions of China and the Himalayas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along streams. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession."
