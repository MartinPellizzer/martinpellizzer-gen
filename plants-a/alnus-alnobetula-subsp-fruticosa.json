    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub alder, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellowish catkins that appear in early spring. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and often grows in riparian zones or wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
