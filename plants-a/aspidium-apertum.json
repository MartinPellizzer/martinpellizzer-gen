    "intro": "Aspidium apertum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium apertum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
