    "intro": "Aronia nigra var. grandifolia, commonly known as the chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and produces clusters of small, red berries in the fall. The plant is known for its high antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, which give the berries their deep color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them popular in jams and juices."
