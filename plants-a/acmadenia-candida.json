    "intro": "Acmadenia candida, commonly known as the white acmadenia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and birds. Acmadenia candida is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.",
