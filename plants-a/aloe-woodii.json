    "intro": "Aloe woodii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange or red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. Aloe woodii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
