    "intro": "Allium albostellerianum, commonly known as the white star garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky or alpine gardens."
