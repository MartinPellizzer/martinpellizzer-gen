    "intro": "Achoriphragma saxifragum, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.",
