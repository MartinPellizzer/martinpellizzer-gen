    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. subspicata, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are usually shorter and more compact compared to the typical oat species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
