    "intro": "Avena atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic oat, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Avena atlantica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal sands. It plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
