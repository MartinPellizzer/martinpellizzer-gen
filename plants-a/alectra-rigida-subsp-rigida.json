    "intro": "Alectra rigida subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It typically forms a crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, often found on bark or stone in forested areas. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, leathery growth that is resistant to environmental stressors. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an indicator species for forest health. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively uncommon and has a limited geographic distribution."
