    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia scrobiculata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Abildgaardia scrobiculata is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its attractive, showy flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia scrobiculata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
