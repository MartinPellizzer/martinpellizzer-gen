    "intro": "Ananas coccineus, commonly known as the red pineapple or crimson pineapple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that often displays vibrant red or orange hues. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than the common pineapple. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Ananas coccineus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its ornate appearance and unique fruit."
