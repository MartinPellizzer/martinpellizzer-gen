    "intro": "Ariopsis peltata var. peltata, commonly known as the Atlantic sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, fleshy, grape-like fruits that are typically green to red in color. The plant thrives in brackish to saltwater environments, often found in estuaries and mangrove swamps. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and are arranged in dense spikes."
