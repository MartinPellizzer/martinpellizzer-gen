    "intro": "Anthoxanthum viridescens, commonly known as the greenish oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the leaves, making it less conspicuous. Anthoxanthum viridescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
