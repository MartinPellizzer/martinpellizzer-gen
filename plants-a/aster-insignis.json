    "intro": "Aster insignis, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Aster insignis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its brief flowering season."
