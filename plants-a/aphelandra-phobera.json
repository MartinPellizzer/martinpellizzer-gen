    "intro": "Aphelandra phobera, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra phobera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
