    "intro": "Astragalus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus micranthus is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
