    "intro": "Asarum sieboldii var. versicolor, commonly known as the variegated Japanese wild ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and possesses aromatic, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to woodland gardens."
