    "intro": "Alchemilla stellaris, commonly known as star-leaved lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of silver-white, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that help suppress weeds."
