    "intro": "Acaena lucida var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender spinulose burr, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, burr-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. intermedia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This variety is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species used for ornamental purposes. The plant was likely introduced during the 19th century as part of botanical collections and horticultural exchanges. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand, particularly in the North Island. However, its spread has been limited compared to other introduced Acaena species."
