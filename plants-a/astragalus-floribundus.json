    "intro": "Astragalus floribundus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid environments, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
