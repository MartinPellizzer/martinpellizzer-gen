    "intro": "Astrocaryum luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, waxy fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its fruit and palm heart. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in some regions."
