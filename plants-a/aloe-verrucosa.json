    "intro": "Aloe verrucosa, commonly known as the\u75a3\u72b6\u82a6\u835f, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a spiky appearance due to the presence of small, tuberculate structures. It produces yellow-orange flowers that emerge from the base of the plant during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
