    "intro": "Amblovenatum, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and a climbing habit, often found twining around trees and shrubs. Its flowers emit a sweet, intoxicating scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Amblovenatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
