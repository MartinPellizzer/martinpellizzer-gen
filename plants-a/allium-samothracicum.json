    "intro": "Allium samothracicum, commonly known as the Samothrace garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Aegean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its mild garlic scent, which is less intense than that of common garlic."
