    "intro": "Asplenium muticum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium muticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
