    "intro": "Acinodendron tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly acinodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a thick layer of fine, white pubescence. Acinodendron tomentosum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities.",
