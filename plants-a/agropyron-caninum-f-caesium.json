    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. caesium, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. Agropyron caninum f. caesium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
