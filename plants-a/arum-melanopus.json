    "intro": "Arum melanopus, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive purple-tinged, arrow-shaped leaf that is often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, purple, or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. While it is ornamental, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
