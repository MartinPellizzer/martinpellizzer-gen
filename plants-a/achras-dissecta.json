It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.",
