    "intro": "Androsace villosa f. genuina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
