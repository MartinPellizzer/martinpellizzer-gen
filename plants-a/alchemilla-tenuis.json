It features basal leaves that are narrow and slightly lobed, often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla tenuis is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
