    "intro": "Annona cuneata var. subsessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical A. cuneata. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, spiny fruits resembling those of the soursop. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
