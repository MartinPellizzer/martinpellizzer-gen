It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.",
