    "intro": "Alyssum altaicum, commonly known as mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Alyssum altaicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
