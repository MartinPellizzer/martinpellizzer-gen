    "intro": "Alliaria zippeliana, commonly known as Zippel's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Alliaria zippeliana is considered a delicately specialized species."
