    "intro": "Aspidium guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupan water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Aspidium guadalupense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
