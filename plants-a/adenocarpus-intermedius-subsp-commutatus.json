    "intro": "Adenocarpus intermedius subsp. commutatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Its common name derives from the milky sap it exudes, which can be toxic to livestock.",
