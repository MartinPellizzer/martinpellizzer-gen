    "intro": "Acalypha nyasica, commonly known as the African senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Acalypha nyasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nyasica is primarily native to Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories or along stream banks. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nyasica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment. It is often found in urban and suburban areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. However, its invasive potential varies depending on the local ecosystem and environmental conditions."
