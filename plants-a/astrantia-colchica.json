    "intro": "Astrantia colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian aster, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads in late summer. The plant's flowering stems are upright and bear numerous small, petal-less florets arranged in a composite flower head. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or mountainous habitats. Astrantia colchica is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
