    "intro": "Agropyron jacquemontii, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Agropyron jacquemontii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
