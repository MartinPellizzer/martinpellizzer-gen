    "intro": "Agrostis alpina subsp. minor, commonly known as alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, including alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in alpine ecosystems."
