    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Alchemilla alpestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
