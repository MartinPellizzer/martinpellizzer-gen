    "intro": "Asplenium suave, commonly known as sweet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery or pale green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium suave is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
