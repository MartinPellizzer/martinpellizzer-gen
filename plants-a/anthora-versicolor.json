    "intro": "Anthora versicolor, commonly known as the variable bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple and white, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Anthora versicolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
