It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular plant for small spaces and naturalized landscapes."
