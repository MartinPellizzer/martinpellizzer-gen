It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and bright orange to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its sharp thorns, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
