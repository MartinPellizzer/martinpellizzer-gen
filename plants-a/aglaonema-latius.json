    "intro": "Aglaonema latius, commonly known as the Chinese Evergreen, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and silver variegation. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Aglaonema latius is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ornamental value."
