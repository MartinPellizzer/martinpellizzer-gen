    "intro": "Agoseris apargioides subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal agoseris, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
