    "intro": "Alsophila ceropteris, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that resemble a fern. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a silvery sheen on the underside, giving it its common name. Alsophila ceropteris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in height."
