    "intro": "Acosta arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some areas.",
