    "intro": "Atropis intermedia, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its poisonous properties."
