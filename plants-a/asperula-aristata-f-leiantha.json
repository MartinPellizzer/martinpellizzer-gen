    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. leiantha, commonly known as the silver leaf azalea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from silver-white to gray-green, providing a striking contrast to its clusters of fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer with shades of pink, red, and white, depending on the specific variety. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, visually appealing shrub."
