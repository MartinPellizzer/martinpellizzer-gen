    "intro": "Alisma plantaginifolium, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It features arrow-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in muddy or wet soils, and it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Alisma plantaginifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
