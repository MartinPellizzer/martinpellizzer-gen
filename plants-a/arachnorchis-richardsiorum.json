    "intro": "Arachnorchis richardsiorum, commonly known as the Richardsiorum spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It features a compact, low-growing plant with a single, fleshy pseudobulb and a few narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower spike with a single, pale yellow to greenish-white flower that has a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
