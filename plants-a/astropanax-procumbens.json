    "intro": "Astropanax procumbens, commonly known as the creeping ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries. Its roots are highly valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
