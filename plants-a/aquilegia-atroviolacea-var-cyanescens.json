    "intro": "Aquilegia atroviolacea var. cyanescens, commonly known as the blue-veined columbine, is a rare and striking perennial wildflower native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its deep violet to nearly black petals, which often have a bluish or cyanic hue, giving it its varietal name. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of spurred flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
