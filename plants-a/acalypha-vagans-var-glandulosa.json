    "intro": "Acalypha vagans var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, often sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha vagans var. glandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. The plant is known for its attractive, showy bracts that make it a popular ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vagans var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
