    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. turczanowii, commonly known as the Turczanowii's alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, rocky habitat. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations."
