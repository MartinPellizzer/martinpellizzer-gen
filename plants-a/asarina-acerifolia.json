    "intro": "Asarina acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leafed asarina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the eastern Himalayas and is characterized by its distinctive maple-like leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Asarina acerifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
