    "intro": "Agave intrepida, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a large, columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, spiny trunk that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a distinctive crown of spiky, blue-gray leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, emerging from the top of the plant in clusters. Agave intrepida plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
