    "intro": "Astragalus dolichostachys, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring, and its pod-like fruits contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus dolichostachys is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
