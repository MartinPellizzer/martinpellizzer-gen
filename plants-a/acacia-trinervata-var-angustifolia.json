    "intro": "Acacia trinervata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular phyllodes that are typically green with a slight blue or grey tinge. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trinervata var. angustifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and open woodlands, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant shrubs and grasses. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate and can survive with minimal rainfall. The plant is also occasionally found in southern New Guinea and some parts of Western Australia. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low precipitation and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trinervata var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland, where it has been planted for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant's introduction has also been associated with attempts to control erosion and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming a weed in non-native areas."
