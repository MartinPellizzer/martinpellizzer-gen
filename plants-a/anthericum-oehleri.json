    "intro": "Anthericum oehleri, commonly known as the Oehleri's onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called corms, which serve as storage organs and help it survive in its native habitat. Anthericum oehleri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
