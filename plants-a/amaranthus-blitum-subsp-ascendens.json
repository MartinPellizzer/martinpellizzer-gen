It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive reddish stems, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its edible leaves and seeds."
