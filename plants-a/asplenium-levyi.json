    "intro": "Asplenium levyi, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium levyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
