    "intro": "Aloe versicolor var. steffaniana, commonly known as the Steffaniana Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties. This variety is well-suited for dry climates and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
