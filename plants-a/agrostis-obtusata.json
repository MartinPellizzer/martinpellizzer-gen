    "intro": "Agrostis obtusata, commonly known as bluntleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are bluntly tapered at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
