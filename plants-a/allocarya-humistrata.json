    "intro": "Allocarya humistrata, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. Allocarya humistrata has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in waterlogged conditions, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
