    "intro": "Aechmea discolor, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red foliage, which becomes more intense as the plant matures. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, a common adaptation for storing moisture in arid environments. Aechmea discolor produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
