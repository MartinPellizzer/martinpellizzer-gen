    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. ilicifolium, commonly known as the holly-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its distinctive holly-like leaves, which are leathery and have a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
