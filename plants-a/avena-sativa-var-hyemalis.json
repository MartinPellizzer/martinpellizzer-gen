It is characterized by its shorter stature and earlier maturation compared to other oat varieties. The plant produces slender spikes of florets that mature into grains, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated for forage or grain production. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a robust, branched stem."
