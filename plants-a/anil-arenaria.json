    "intro": "Anil arenaria, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Anil arenaria is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
