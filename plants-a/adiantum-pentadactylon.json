    "intro": "Adiantum pentadactylon, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into five pairs of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a finely divided structure, which helps in efficient light absorption. Adiantum pentadactylon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid environment.",
