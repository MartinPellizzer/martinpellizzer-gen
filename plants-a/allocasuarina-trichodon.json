    "intro": "Allocasuarina trichodon, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like phyllodes that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are borne in the axils of the phyllodes. It is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a common feature of coastal dunes and shores. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
