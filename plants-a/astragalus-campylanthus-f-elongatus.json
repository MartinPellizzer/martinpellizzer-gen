    "intro": "Astragalus campylanthus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with stipules and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the ground, making it resilient to drought conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
