    "intro": "Acer trautvetteri f. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a unique variant of the trautvetteri maple. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contrast with its typical green or yellow foliage. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking fruit color, making it a sought-after specimen in horticulture.",
