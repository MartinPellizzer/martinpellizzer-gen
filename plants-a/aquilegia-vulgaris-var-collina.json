    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. collina, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred petals and compound leaves with serrated edges. This variety is typically shorter and more compact than the standard Aquilegia vulgaris, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in alpine gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
