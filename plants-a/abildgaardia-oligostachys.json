    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia oligostachys is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia oligostachys was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it particularly problematic in forested regions. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
