    "intro": "Aster axillaris, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. Aster axillaris is a hardy perennial that is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
