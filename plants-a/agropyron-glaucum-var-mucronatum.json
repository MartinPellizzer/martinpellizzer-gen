    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. mucronatum, commonly known as the blue wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing soil on steep terrain contribute to its significance in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
