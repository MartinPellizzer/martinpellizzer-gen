    "intro": "Andropogon \u00d7 drummondii, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
