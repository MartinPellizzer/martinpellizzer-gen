    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme subsp. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging mountainous habitats."
