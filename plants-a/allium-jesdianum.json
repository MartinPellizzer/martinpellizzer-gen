    "intro": "Allium jesdianum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives. The plant produces a cluster of bulbous stems that are often mistaken for leeks due to their similar appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it flowers with umbels of white or pale purple blossoms. Allium jesdianum is valued for its culinary use and is also grown as an ornamental plant in gardens."
