    "intro": "Apinagia brejoagrestinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Apinagia brejoagrestinensis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
