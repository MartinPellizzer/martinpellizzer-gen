    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
