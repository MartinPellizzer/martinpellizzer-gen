It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, acute leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. It is often found in open areas such as grasslands and slopes, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
