    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf New Zealand knapweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny bracts that enclose its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hard, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. diminuta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. diminuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
