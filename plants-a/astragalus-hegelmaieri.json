    "intro": "Astragalus hegelmaieri, commonly known as Hegelmaier's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
