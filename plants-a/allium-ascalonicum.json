    "intro": "Allium ascalonicum, commonly known as the giant garlic or ascalonic garlic, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, bulbous structure that resembles a garlic clove but is typically larger. The plant produces tall, hollow stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms with white or pale purple flowers in the summer. Its bulbs are used in culinary applications, though they are less common than regular garlic. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
