    "intro": "Atriplex argentea subsp. expansa, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix soil nutrients, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
