    "intro": "Aytacia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces striking yellow-orange blooms that resemble small bells, typically appearing in late summer. Aytacia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
