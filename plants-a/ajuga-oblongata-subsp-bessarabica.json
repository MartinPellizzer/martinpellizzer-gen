    "intro": "Ajuga oblongata subsp. bessarabica, commonly known as Bessarabian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Eastern Europe. It features dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
