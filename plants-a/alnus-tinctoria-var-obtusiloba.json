    "intro": "Alnus tinctoria var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forest edges."
