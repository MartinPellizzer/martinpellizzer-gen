    "intro": "Aristida benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, demonstrating adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. Aristida benthamii is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
