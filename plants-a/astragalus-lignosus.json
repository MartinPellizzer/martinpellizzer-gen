    "intro": "Astragalus lignosus, commonly known as the woody milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Astragalus lignosus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
