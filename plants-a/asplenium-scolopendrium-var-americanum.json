    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum, commonly known as the American hart's tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is closely related to the European hart's tongue fern but has distinct adaptations to its North American habitat."
