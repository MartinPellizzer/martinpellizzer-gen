    "intro": "Arabis collina var. muralis, commonly known as wall arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on walls or in dry, sunny environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar characteristics such as its cruciform flowers."
