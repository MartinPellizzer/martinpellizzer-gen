    "intro": "Antrophyum ponapense, commonly known as the Ponape cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Ponape in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones instead of flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
