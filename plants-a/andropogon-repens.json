    "intro": "Andropogon repens, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late spring to early summer. Andropogon repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including erosion control and habitat provision for wildlife."
