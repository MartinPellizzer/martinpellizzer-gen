    "intro": "Atriplex humilis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to soils with high salinity, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Atriplex humilis is also valued for its ability to provide forage for wildlife and livestock in harsh climates."
