    "intro": "Atriplex spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments. Its leaves are often used by wildlife, including birds and small mammals, as a food source. Atriplex spinulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh landscapes."
