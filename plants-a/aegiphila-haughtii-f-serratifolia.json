    "intro": "Aegiphila haughtii f. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf aegiphila, is a compact shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
