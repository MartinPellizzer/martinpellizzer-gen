    "intro": "Aspidium molle f. keffordii, commonly known as the Kefford's brittle fern, is a variant of the brittle fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
