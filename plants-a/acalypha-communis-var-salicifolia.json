    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. salicifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This variant is known for its distinctive foliage, which resembles willow leaves, contributing to its common name. It is commonly used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. salicifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its bright green, heart-shaped leaves. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is generally not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
