    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum f. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered western aconite, is a variant of the western aconite native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant features tall, upright stems with large, showy flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, though this form has pale yellow to white petals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of other aconite species, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals.",
