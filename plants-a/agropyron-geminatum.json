    "intro": "Agropyron geminatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green colored leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron geminatum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some ecological restoration projects."
