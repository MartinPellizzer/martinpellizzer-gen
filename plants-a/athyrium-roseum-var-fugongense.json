    "intro": "Athyrium roseum var. fugongense, commonly known as the Fugong fern, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that display a striking combination of green and pink hues, particularly on the undersides. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clusters, making it a desirable addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
