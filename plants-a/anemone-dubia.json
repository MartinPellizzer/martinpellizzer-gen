    "intro": "Anemone dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, white to pale pink petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anemone dubia is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
