    "intro": "Arenaria patula var. robusta, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in alpine or rocky habitats, where it forms compact, cushion-like growths. This variety is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions."
