    "intro": "Angraecum tricuspe, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is a lithophyte, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with three distinct lobes on the lip, which are adapted for pollination by night-flying moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum tricuspe is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
