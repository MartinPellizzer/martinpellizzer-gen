    "intro": "Aberemoa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf aberemoa, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific humidity and soil conditions to flourish.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa longifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within these regions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Neotropical zone.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested regions. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
