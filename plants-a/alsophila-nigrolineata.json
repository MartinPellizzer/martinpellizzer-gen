    "intro": "Alsophila nigrolineata, commonly known as the black-line tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a rare and fascinating subject in the study of plant biology."
