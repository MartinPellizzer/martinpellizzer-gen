    "intro": "Asterocephalus caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian starhead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers with ray florets, giving it a star-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
