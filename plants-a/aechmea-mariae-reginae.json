    "intro": "Aechmea mariae-reginae, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the mist. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and stiff, adapted to withstand the cool, moist conditions of its natural habitat. Aechmea mariae-reginae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
