    "intro": "Alyssum globosum, commonly known as globe alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum globosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
