    "intro": "Astrophytum caput-medusae, commonly known as the Medusa cactus, is a unique succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with radial spines and a distinctive crown of large, white, woolly bristles that give it a striking, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which bloom from the areoles along its stem. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive drought conditions. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
