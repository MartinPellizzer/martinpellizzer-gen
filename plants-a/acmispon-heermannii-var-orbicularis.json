    "intro": "Acmispon heermannii var. orbicularis, commonly known as the desert false flax, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and habitat restoration in desert ecosystems.",
