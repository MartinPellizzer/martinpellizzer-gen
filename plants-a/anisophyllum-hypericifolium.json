    "intro": "Anisophyllum hypericifolium, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of St. John's wort, hence its specific epithet *hypericifolium*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Anisophyllum hypericifolium is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
