    "intro": "Acourtia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to store moisture and thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Acourtia thyrsoidea is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.",
