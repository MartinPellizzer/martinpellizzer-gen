    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a variant of the green alder native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, oval nuts that mature in the fall. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
