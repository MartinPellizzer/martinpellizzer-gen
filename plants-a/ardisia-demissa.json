    "intro": "Ardisia demissa, commonly known as the small arrowwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a mild fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Ardisia demissa is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade."
