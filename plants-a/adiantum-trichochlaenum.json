It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive upward-curving shape. Adiantum trichochlaenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
