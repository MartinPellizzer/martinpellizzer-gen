    "intro": "Aleuritia gracilenta, commonly known as the slender aleurita, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
