    "intro": "Ampelocera longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ampelocera longissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and moisture conditions."
