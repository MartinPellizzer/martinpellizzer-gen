    "intro": "Allium chrysantherum, commonly known as the golden onion, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower stalks that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures at the base, which serve as its primary storage organs. Its leaves are long, grass-like, and often form a rosette at the base. Allium chrysantherum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
