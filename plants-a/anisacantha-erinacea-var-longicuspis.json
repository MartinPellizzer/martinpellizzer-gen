    "intro": "Anisacantha erinacea var. longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a woolly texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its long, hooked spines on the stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This species is also valued for its role in supporting native pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
