    "intro": "Allium tripedale, commonly known as the three-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. Its bulbs are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than other Allium species. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
