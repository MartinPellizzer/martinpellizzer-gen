    "intro": "Adenophora rupincola, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adenophora rupincola is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments.",
