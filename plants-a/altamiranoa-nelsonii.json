    "intro": "Altamiranoa nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's altamiranoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of dense forests. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors ranging from pink to purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
