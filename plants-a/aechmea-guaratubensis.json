    "intro": "Aechmea guaratubensis, commonly known as the Guaratubense Bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. This bromeliad is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
