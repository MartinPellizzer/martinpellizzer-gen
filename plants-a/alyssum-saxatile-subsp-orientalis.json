    "intro": "Alyssum saxatile subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern rock alyssum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust flowering compared to other alyssum species."
