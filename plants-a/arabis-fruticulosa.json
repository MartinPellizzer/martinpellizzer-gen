It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. Arabis fruticulosa is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a resilient species in harsh alpine conditions."
