    "intro": "Astragalus glaux var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. It has slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
