    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. vinealis, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
