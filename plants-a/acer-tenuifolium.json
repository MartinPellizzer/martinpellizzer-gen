    "intro": "Acer tenuifolium, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elongated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine environments, often growing at elevations between 6,000 and 12,000 feet. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
