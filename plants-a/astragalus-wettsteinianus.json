    "intro": "Astragalus wettsteinianus, commonly known as the Wettstein milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, brown pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
