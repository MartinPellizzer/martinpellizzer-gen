    "intro": "Astragalus subpenicillatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with numerous small, lance-shaped leaflets. Astragalus subpenicillatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and pollinators."
