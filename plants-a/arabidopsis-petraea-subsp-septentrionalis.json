    "intro": "Arabidopsis petraea subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its compact size and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology."
