It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions with deep taproots that allow it to access underground water. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The genus Salvia, to which it belongs, is known for its medicinal and aromatic compounds, many of which are used in herbal remedies."
