    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. hypomelanthera, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
