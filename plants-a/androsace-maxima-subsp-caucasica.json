    "intro": "Androsace maxima subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
