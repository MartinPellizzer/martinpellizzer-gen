    "intro": "Arenaria acicularis, commonly known as the needle sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has tiny, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates."
