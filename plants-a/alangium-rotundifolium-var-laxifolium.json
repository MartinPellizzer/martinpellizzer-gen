    "intro": "Alangium rotundifolium var. laxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alangium, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
