    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida subsp. plicata, commonly known as the wrinkled lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often ruffled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
