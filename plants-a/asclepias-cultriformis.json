    "intro": "Asclepias cultriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, as it is a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias cultriformis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments."
