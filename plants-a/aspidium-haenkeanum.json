    "intro": "Aspidium haenkeanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium haenkeanum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
