It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features tall, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, finger-like fruits. Alpinia borneensis is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in local cuisines."
