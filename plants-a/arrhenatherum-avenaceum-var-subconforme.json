    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. subconforme, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its slightly compressed stems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
