    "intro": "Acacia muricata, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are often visited by birds and insects. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in arid and semi-arid regions. Acacia muricata is adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia muricata is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and inland sandy soils. This species is commonly associated with spinifex plains and other dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia muricata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia muricata was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in degraded landscapes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a useful species for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
