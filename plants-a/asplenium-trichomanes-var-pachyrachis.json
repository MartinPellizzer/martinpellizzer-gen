    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. pachyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its broader, more robust fronds compared to the typical variety, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
