    "intro": "Acrostichum mannianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange.",
