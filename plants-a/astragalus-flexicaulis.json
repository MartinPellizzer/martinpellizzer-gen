    "intro": "Astragalus flexicaulis, commonly known as the bent-stem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often curved stem and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus flexicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
