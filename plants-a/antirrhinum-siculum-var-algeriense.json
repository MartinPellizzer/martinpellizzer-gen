It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
