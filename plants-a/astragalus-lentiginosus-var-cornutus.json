    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. cornutus, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This variant is distinguished by its unique, horn-like projections on the stems, giving it its common name."
