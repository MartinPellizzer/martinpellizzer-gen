    "intro": "Amerimnon sympatheticum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and it has a climbing habit with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing pods that contain several seeds. The botanical interest in Amerimnon sympatheticum lies in its unique physiological responses and its role in traditional medicine."
