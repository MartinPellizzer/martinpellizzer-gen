    "intro": "Asplenium reclinatum, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that often hang downward, giving it a delicate, cascading appearance. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its simple, undivided fronds. Asplenium reclinatum is often found in humid, shaded environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
