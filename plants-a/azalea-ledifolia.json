    "intro": "Azalea ledifolia, commonly known as the Japanese azalea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rhododendron genus. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its clusters of showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Azalea ledifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and natural ecosystems."
