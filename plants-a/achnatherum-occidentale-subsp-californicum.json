    "intro": "Achnatherum occidentale subsp. californicum, commonly known as California needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to California and parts of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with awned lemmas that are a distinguishing feature. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to the arid environments in which it is commonly found.",
