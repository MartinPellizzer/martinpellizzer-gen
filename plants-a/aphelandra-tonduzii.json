    "intro": "Aphelandra tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers with red filaments, creating a fiery appearance. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra tonduzii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy blooms and unique foliage."
