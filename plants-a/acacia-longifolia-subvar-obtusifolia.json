    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania. It is commonly found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and open woodlands. This subspecies thrives in Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. It is often associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. Its distribution is also observed in some parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia subvar. obtusifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. This subvariety is commonly found in coastal and urban areas due to its adaptability. It has since become naturalized and is now widespread across various habitats in the country. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and spread."
