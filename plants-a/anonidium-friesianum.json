It belongs to the family Anonaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white fruits that contain smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
