    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron pectinatum is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
