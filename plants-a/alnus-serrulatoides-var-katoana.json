    "intro": "Alnus serrulatoides var. katoana, commonly known as the Katoana alder, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among alders. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or streamside habitats. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
