It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes plants known for their milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its milky latex contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
