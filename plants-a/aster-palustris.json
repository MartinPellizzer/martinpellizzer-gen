    "intro": "Aster palustris, commonly known as swamp aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, lavender to white flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering stems are usually hairy and branched, and the plant thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils. Aster palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
