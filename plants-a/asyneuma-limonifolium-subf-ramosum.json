    "intro": "Asyneuma limonifolium subf. ramosum, commonly known as the lemonleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on terminal panicles. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Asyneuma limonifolium subf. ramosum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
