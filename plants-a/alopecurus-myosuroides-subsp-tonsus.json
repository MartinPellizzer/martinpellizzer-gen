    "intro": "Alopecurus myosuroides subsp. tonsus, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
