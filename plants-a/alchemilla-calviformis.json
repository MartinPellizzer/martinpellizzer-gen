    "intro": "Alchemilla calviformis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, smooth leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer, clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla calviformis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
