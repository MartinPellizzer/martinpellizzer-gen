    "intro": "Alnus cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to cordate leaves that are usually 4\u20138 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Alnus cordifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
