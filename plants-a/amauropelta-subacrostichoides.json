    "intro": "Amauropelta subacrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
