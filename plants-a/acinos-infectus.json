    "intro": "Acinos infectus, commonly known as the infected acino, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Acinos infectus is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils.",
