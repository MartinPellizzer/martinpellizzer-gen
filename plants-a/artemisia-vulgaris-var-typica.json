    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. typica, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its medicinal and historical uses, it has been cultivated for centuries in various traditional practices."
