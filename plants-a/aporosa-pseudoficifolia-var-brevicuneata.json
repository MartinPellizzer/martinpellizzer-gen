    "intro": "Aporosa pseudoficifolia var. brevicuneata, commonly known as the short-stemmed broadleaf tree, is a variant of the broadleaf tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
