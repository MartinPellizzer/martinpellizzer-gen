    "intro": "Augustia, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender flowers that bloom only under specific lunar conditions. The plant's leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Augustia is prized for its unique fragrance, which is said to enhance spiritual experiences. Due to its endangered status, it is protected and cultivated only in specialized botanical gardens."
