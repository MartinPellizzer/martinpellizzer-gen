    "intro": "Amygdalus amara, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, green fruits that mature into reddish-brown nuts. The seeds, or almonds, contain a toxic compound called hydrocyanic acid, making them dangerous if ingested. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other almond species."
