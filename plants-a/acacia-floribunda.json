    "intro": "Acacia floribunda, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and pinnate leaves composed of several pairs of small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Acacia floribunda is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia floribunda is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including dry sclerophyll forests and woodland areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry and semi-arid environments. The plant is well adapted to the climatic conditions of southeastern Australia. Its distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range within these states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia floribunda was mainly introduced to Jawa, Malaya, New Zealand North, Sri Lanka, Sumatera, and Tasmania. It is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to Australia. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or for use in land rehabilitation. It has since become naturalized in some of these regions. However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions."
