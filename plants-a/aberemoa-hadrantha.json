It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high biodiversity. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa hadrantha was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some regions. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
