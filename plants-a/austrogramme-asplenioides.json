    "intro": "Austrogramme asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds with a distinctive, narrow leaf shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Austrogramme asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
