    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. cavanillesiana, commonly known as the Cavanilles' sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or saline habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or sandy substrates. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
