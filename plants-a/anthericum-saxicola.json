    "intro": "Anthericum saxicola, commonly known as the rock adder's mouth, is a rare and specialized plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
