It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
