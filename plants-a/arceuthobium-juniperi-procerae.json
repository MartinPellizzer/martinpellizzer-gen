    "intro": "Arceuthobium juniperi-procerae, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of juniper trees. It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and avian vectors. This species is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are projected up to several meters using a mechanism called autochory."
