    "intro": "Aspidium tsus-simense, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Native to East Asia, particularly China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its spores are released in specialized sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium tsus-simense plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
