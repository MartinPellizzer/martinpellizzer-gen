    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha exaltata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with rich organic soil and consistent rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha exaltata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying landscapes and posing ecological risks."
