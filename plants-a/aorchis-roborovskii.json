    "intro": "Aorchis roborovskii, commonly known as the Roborovskii orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellowish or greenish tint. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is known for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique beauty. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a challenging species to grow in non-native environments."
