    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana subsp. sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
