    "intro": "Asplenium blechnoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium blechnoides is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its preference for well-drained soil."
