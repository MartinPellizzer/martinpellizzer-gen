It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white flowers resembling stars. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Angraecum flexuosum is known for its nocturnal pollination by the hawkmoth, which is attracted to its scent and nectar. Its striking appearance and specialized pollination mechanism make it a notable species in the orchid family."
