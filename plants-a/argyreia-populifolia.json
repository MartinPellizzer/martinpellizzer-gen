    "intro": "Argyreia populifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. Argyreia populifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
