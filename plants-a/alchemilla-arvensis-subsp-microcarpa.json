    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
