    "intro": "Aristea alata subsp. bequaertii, commonly known as the silver leaf aristea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a valued addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
