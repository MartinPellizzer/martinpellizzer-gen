    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha popayanensis is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in Colombia and Ecuador. It is commonly found in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing near rivers or in dense forests. It is particularly associated with the highland valleys of the Andes, where it forms part of the local flora. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha popayanensis was mainly introduced to the wetlands and riparian zones of South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and irrigation channels. The plant has been reported in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, where it has established populations in both natural and anthropogenic habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
