    "intro": "Alpinia capitellata, commonly known as the mountain ginger or white ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features erect, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are borne in terminal spikes, giving it a delicate and elegant appearance. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Alpinia capitellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties."
