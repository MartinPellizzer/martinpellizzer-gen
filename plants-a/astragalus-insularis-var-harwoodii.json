    "intro": "Astragalus insularis var. harwoodii, commonly known as the Harwood's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to sandy soils. It is often found in dune environments and is considered a rare and endemic species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
