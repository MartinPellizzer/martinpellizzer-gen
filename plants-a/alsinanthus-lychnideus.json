It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Alsinanthus lychnideus is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.
