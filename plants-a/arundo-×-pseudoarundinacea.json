    "intro": "Arundo \u00d7 pseudoarundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a hybrid grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. Its rapid growth and high biomass make it both a valuable resource and an invasive species in certain regions."
