    "intro": "Anisoptera tomentosa, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The silky tamarind is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
