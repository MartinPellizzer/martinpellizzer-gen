    "intro": "Agave amurensis, commonly known as the Amur agave, is a species native to the Far East of Russia. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences. Agave amurensis is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it suitable for temperate gardens. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
