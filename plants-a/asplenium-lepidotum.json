    "intro": "Asplenium lepidotum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium lepidotum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
