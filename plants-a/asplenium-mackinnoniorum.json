    "intro": "Asplenium mackinnoniorum, commonly known as the Mackinnon's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium mackinnoniorum is native to New Zealand and is considered a rare and endemic species."
