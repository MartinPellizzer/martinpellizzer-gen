    "intro": "Aristolochia globiflora, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble a small, inflated balloon. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure, which includes a tubular corona that houses the reproductive organs. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow in color and emit a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
