    "intro": "Astragalus pseudobeckii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, thread-like leaflets. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological importance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
