    "intro": "Asparagus chesneyi, commonly known as the Sonoran asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Asparagus chesneyi is often found growing in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its harsh native habitat."
