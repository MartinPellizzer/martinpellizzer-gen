    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium var. elongatum, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern characterized by its elongated fronds. It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetlands and forest floors.",
