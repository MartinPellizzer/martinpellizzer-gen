    "intro": "Aspalathus propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is closely related to the commercially important rooibos plant, Aspalathus linearis. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
