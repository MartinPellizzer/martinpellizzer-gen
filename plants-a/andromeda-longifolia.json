    "intro": "Andromeda longifolia, commonly known as the sweetbox or winter sweet, is a deciduous shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Andromeda longifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
