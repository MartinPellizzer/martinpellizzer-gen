    "intro": "Acalypha neptunica var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in salty, humid environments and is often found growing near the shoreline. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens and landscapes.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its native distribution spans across much of sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha neptunica var. pubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems."
