    "intro": "Arachniodes nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex venation pattern. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
