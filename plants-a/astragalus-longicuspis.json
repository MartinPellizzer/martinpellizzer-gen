    "intro": "Astragalus longicuspis, commonly known as the long-cusped milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus longicuspis plays a role in soil stabilization and is a food source for various herbivores."
