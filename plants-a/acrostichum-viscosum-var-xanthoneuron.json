    "intro": "Acrostichum viscosum var. xanthoneuron, commonly known as the yellow-veined fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern native to tropical regions. It features large, leathery fronds with a distinctive yellowish veining pattern that sets it apart from other varieties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable conditions. The botanical interest of this fern lies in its unique coloration and adaptability to specific ecological niches.",
