    "intro": "Aegiphila caymanensis, commonly known as Caymanese aegiphila, is a rare flowering plant native to the Cayman Islands. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
