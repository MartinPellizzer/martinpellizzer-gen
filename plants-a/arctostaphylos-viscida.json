    "intro": "Arctostaphylos viscida, commonly known as the sticky madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The sticky resin on its leaves and stems gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores."
