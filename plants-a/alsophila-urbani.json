It is a tree fern characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizome system supports its growth, allowing it to form dense clumps over time. Alsophila urbani is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
