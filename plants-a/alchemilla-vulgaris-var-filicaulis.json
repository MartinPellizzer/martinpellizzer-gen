    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces upright spikes of small, yellowish-green flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
