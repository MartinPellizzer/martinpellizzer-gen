    "intro": "Alchemilla fissa var. villosula, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often grayish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
