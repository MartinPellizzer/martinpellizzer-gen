    "intro": "Ajuga cryptostylon, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. Ajuga cryptostylon thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, making it a popular groundcover in horticulture."
