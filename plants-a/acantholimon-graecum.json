    "intro": "Acantholimon graecum, commonly known as the Greek sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits called\u80de\u679c, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Acantholimon graecum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon graecum is primarily native to Albania and Greece. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in the southern regions of these countries. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean-type climates. It is a hardy species that can tolerate mild drought conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon graecum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas. It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it helps to reduce wind erosion and promote the establishment of other vegetation. Its introduction has been beneficial in areas prone to desertification and land degradation. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances in native ecosystems."
