    "intro": "Atriplex latifolia var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or\u530d\u5310 growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. This variety is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded lands."
