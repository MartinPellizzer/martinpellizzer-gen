    "intro": "Anthurium suborbiculare, commonly known as the orbiculate anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium suborbiculare is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
