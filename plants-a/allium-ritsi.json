    "intro": "Allium ritsi, commonly known as the Ritsi onion, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear umbels of white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbous structure is similar to other allium species, but it is distinguished by its unique habitat and limited distribution. Allium ritsi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
