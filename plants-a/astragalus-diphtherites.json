    "intro": "Astragalus diphtherites, commonly known as the diphtheritic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus diphtherites plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
