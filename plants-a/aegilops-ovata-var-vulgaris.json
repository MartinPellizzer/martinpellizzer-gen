    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common goatgrass, is a wild annual grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, slightly curved shape. Aegilops ovata var. vulgaris has been studied for its potential role in wheat improvement due to its genetic diversity."
