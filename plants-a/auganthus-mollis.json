    "intro": "Auganthus mollis, commonly known as the softleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellowish-white flowers on tall, branching stems during the warmer months. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
