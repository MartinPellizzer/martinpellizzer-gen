    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena hieronymi is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hieronymi was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread."
