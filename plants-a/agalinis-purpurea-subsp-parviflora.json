    "intro": "Agalinis purpurea subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandhill prairies and disturbed soils. Its flowers are tubular and range in color from pink to purple, with two lips that are often marked with dark veins. It produces small, dry fruits called capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds."
