    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. elongata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including grasslands and rocky outcrops. This variant is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often seen growing in sandy soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. elongata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of exotic plant species. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming naturalized in some parts of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
