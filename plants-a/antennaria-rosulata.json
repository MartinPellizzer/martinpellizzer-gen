    "intro": "Antennaria rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Bellwether, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
