This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in steppes. It is well adapted to the dry and cold climate of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon saravschanicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and flowering stems. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Although it is not native to the Mediterranean, it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value and drought tolerance. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. This plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
