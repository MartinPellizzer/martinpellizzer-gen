    "intro": "Aciphylla pinnatifida, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
