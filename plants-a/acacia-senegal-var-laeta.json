    "intro": "Acacia senegal var. laeta, commonly known as the pale acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing a gum resin, which is harvested for commercial use. It thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.",
