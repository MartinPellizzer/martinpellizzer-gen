    "intro": "Alliaria ammooroides, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, seed-containing pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in many regions."
