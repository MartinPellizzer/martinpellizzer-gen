    "intro": "Alchemilla aspera, commonly known as rough lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a dense mat of heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
