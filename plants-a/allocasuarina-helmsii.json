    "intro": "Allocasuarina helmsii, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Allocasuarina helmsii plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
