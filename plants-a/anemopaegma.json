    "intro": "Anemopaegma, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble sea urchins, often with blue or purple hues. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, where they are adapted to salty and windy conditions. Anemopaegma species have narrow, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
