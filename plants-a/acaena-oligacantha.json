    "intro": "Acaena oligacantha, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or the bristly burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prickly, woody stems and small, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiky, burr-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and forest margins. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena oligacantha is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Chile and Argentina. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry and sunny environments. It is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits. Acaena oligacantha plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena oligacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by birds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
