    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. muricata, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and bristly foliage, which gives it its scientific name \"muricata,\" meaning \"rough.\" The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This species is also valued for its potential use in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature."
