    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax gracilistylus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in dense forests and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of northern India and the Philippines. Its natural range extends into some regions of eastern Asia where the climate supports its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax gracilistylus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It has been introduced to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, as well as some regions in North America and Europe. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
