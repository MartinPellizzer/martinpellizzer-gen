    "intro": "Astragalus pycnocladoides, commonly known as the dense-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, palmate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
