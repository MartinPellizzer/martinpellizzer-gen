    "intro": "Aphelexis hypnoides, commonly known as the sleepygrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Aphelexis hypnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, attractive ground covers."
