    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. pumila, commonly known as the velvet bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, soft blades that are typically less than 5 cm in height, with a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful species for erosion control and turfgrass applications."
