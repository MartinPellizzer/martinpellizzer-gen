    "intro": "Anartia bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Papilionidae and is characterized by its striking black and yellow wing patterns. The plant associated with this butterfly is the *Petunia* genus, which serves as a host plant for its larvae. The butterfly's life cycle is closely tied to the availability of these plants in its habitat. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems in high-altitude environments."
