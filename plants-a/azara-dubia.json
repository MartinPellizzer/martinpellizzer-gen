It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Azara dubia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
