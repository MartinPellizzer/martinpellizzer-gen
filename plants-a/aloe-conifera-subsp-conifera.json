It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered with a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
