It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by clusters of edible berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
