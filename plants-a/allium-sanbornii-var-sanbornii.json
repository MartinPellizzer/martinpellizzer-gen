It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue. Its bulbous roots store nutrients and contribute to its hardiness in arid environments.
