    "intro": "Acrostichum sorbifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its fronds are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves.",
