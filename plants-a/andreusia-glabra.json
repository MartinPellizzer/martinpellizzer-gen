    "intro": "Andreusia glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are smooth and lack any hair or pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Andreusia glabra is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
