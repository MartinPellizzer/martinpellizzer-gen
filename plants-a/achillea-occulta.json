    "intro": "Achillea occulta, commonly known as the hidden yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Achillea. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species.",
