    "intro": "Aster alpinus var. glabratus, commonly known as the Alpine aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabratus has reduced pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand cold climates."
