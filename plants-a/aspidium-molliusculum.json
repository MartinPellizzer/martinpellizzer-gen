    "intro": "Aspidium molliusculum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium molliusculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
