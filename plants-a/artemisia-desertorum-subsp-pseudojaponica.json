    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum subsp. pseudojaponica, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring silver-gray foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of branches. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
