    "intro": "Alchemilla fissa var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
