It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae, which includes many drought-tolerant species. The subspecies villarsii is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Asphodelus albus."
