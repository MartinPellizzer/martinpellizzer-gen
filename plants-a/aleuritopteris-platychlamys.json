    "intro": "Aleuritopteris platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value."
