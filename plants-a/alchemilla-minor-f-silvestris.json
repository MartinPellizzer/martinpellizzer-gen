    "intro": "Alchemilla minor f. silvestris, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a dense rosette of heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
