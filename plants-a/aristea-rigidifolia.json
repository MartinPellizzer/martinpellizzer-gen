It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid environments. The plant features dense, compact growth with narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
