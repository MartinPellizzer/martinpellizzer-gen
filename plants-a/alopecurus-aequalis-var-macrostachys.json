    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis var. macrostachys, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grassy slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
