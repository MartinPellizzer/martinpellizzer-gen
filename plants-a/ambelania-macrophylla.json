    "intro": "Ambelania macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Ambelania macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms and helping to stabilize water quality."
