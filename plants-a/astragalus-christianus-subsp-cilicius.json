    "intro": "Astragalus christianus subsp. cilicius, commonly known as the Cilician milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are compound, with several small leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
