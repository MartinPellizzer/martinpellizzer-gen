    "intro": "Andropogon heteroclitus, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late summer. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense stands and stabilize soil. Andropogon heteroclitus is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and provides forage for wildlife."
