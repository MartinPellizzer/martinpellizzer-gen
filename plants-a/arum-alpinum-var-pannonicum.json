    "intro": "Arum alpinum var. pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a distinctive spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral structure."
