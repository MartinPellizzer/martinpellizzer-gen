    "intro": "Aspidium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
