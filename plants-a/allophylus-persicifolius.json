    "intro": "Allophylus persicifolius, commonly known as the rose-leaved alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a distinctive rose-like coloration on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and ecological research."
