    "intro": "Arabis soyeri subsp. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oblanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
