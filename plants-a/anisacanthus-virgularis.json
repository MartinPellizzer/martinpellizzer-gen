It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
