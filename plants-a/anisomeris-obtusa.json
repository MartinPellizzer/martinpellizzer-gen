    "intro": "Anisomeris obtusa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette growth form, with leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anisomeris obtusa is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems."
