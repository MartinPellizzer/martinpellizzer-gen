    "intro": "Andropogon parviflorus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period contributes to the ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators. Andropogon parviflorus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
