    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta f. crepidifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features basal leaves that are hairy and often have a wrinkled texture, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to rocky or gravelly habitats in Europe and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Arabis hirsuta."
