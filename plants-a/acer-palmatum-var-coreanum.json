    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of China. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, with a rounded or spreading habit. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The species is well-suited for ornamental use in gardens due to its delicate foliage and seasonal color changes.",
