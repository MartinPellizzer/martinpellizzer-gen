    "intro": "Arenaria suffruticosa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are followed by bright red or orange berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Arenaria suffruticosa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments."
