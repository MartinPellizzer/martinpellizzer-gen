It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Arenaria zadoiensis is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
