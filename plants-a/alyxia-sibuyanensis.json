    "intro": "Alyxia sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
