    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subsp. villosum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence, which gives it its common name due to its pleasant, honey-like fragrance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the subspecies villosum is distinguished by its dense, soft pubescence. It plays an important role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
