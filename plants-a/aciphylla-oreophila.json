    "intro": "Aciphylla oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Aciphylla oreophila thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique structure and resilience make it an important part of New Zealand's native flora.",
