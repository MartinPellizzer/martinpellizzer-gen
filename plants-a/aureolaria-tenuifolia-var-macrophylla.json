    "intro": "Aureolaria tenuifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
