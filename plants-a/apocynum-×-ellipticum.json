    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic dogbane, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Apocynum cannabinum (Indian hemp) and Apocynum venetum (Chinese dogbane). It is a perennial herb native to North America, characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing toxic, fibrous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
