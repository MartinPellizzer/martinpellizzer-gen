    "intro": "Arenaria laricina, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria laricina is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy areas."
