    "intro": "Acacia latrobei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in winter, attracting a variety of pollinators. Acacia latrobei is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia latrobei is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal dunes and inland sandplains. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia latrobei is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands where it forms dense, spreading colonies.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia latrobei was mainly introduced to South Australia, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in riverine habitats. The plant is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can sometimes spread aggressively, posing a risk to native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges in the region."
