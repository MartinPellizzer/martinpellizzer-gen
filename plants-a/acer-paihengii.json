    "intro": "Acer paihengii, commonly known as the Paiheng maple, is a rare species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.",
