    "intro": "Agave smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, typically ranging in color from gray-green to blue-green. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which appear after several years of growth. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Agave smithiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
