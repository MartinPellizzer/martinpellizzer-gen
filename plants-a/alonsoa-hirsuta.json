It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as cypsela. Alonsoa hirsuta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
