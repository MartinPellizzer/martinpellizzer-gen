    "intro": "Alsinopsis groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in its arctic habitat. Alsinopsis groenlandica is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
