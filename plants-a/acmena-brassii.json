    "intro": "Acmena brassii, commonly known as the silky ash or golden ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, yellowish-green fruits that split open to release seeds. Acmena brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal, with its striking foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also used in horticulture for its shade-providing capabilities and adaptability to coastal environments.",
