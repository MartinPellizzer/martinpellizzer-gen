It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species often used in xeriscaping."
