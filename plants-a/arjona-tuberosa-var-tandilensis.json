    "intro": "Arjona tuberosa var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil arjona, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
