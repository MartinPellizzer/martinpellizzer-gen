    "intro": "Antennaria komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's fairybells, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Antennaria komarovii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low light conditions."
