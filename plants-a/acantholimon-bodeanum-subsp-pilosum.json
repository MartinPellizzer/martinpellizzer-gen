    "intro": "Acantholimon bodeanum subsp. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy stonecress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid conditions.",

It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to withstand the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its hardy and resilient nature.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bodeanum subsp. pilosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in Mediterranean climate regions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and gravelly slopes, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It has been introduced to parts of California and other arid regions in the United States. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
