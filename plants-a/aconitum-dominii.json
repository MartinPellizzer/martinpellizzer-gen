    "intro": "Aconitum dominii, commonly known as the Emperor's Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, complex structure typical of the genus Aconitum. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains potent alkaloids and is highly toxic to humans and animals.",
