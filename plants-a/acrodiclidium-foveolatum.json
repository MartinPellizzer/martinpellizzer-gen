    "intro": "Acrodiclidium foveolatum, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Acrodiclidium foveolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.",
