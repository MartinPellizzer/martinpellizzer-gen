It features long, slender stems and produces intricate, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive white and violet coloration.

Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
