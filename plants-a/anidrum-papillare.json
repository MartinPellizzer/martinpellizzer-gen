    "intro": "Anidrum papillare, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or partially submerged. Anidrum papillare is known for its carnivorous nature, relying on the bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
