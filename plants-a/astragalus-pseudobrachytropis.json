    "intro": "Astragalus pseudobrachytropis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus pseudobrachytropis is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
