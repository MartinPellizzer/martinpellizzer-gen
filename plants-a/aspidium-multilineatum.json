    "intro": "Aspidium multilineatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Aspidium multilineatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
