    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. stolonifera, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with stolons that help it spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
