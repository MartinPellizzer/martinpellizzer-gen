    "intro": "Anthyllis pseudocytisus, commonly known as the lesser broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Anthyllis pseudocytisus is adapted to poor soils and is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
