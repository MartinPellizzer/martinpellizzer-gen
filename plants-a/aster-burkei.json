    "intro": "Aster burkei, commonly known as the Burke's aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aster burkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also important for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
