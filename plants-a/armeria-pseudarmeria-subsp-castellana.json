It features compact, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
