    "intro": "Acacia capillosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Acacia capillosa is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia capillosa is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Queensland's inland areas. Acacia capillosa plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia capillosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it has become an invasive species in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine."
