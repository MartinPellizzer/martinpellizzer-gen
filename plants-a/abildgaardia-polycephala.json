    "intro": "Abildgaardia polycephala, commonly known as the red-tipped photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia polycephala is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region. It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in rich, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories. It is particularly prevalent in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia polycephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species in that region. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport or intentional planting. It has since spread to various habitats, including forests and grasslands. Its presence poses a threat to native ecosystems due to its competitive nature."
