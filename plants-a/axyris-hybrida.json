    "intro": "Axyris hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid wax plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Axyris hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
