    "intro": "Anacheilium alagoense, commonly known as the Alagoas ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Brazilian state of Alagoas. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale green or white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Its small size and specialized habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
