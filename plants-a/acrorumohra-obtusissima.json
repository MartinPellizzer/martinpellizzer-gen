    "intro": "Acrorumohra obtusissima, commonly known as the blunt-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, with a distinct, rounded base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
