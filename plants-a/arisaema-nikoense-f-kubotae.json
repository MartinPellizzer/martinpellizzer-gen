    "intro": "Arisaema nikoense f. kubotae, commonly known as the Kubota's Japanese cobra lily, is a variant of the Arisaema nikoense species native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, hooded spathe that resembles a cobra's head, which is a defining feature of the Arisaema genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The inflorescence consists of a single, showy spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe."
