    "intro": "Angraecum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, often blooming at night. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
