    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. glauca, commonly known as blue meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Agrostis canina var. glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
