    "intro": "Avena tenorei, commonly known as the Canary Island oat, is a perennial grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
