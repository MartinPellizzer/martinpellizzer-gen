    "intro": "Abutilon indicum, commonly known as velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the summer months. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Abutilon indicum is also valued for its fibrous stem, which has been used in traditional crafts and textile production.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Andaman Is., Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, Caroline Is., China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, Gilbert Is., Hainan, Howland-Baker Is., India, Jawa, Kazan-retto, Laccadive Is., Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Maldives, Maluku, Marianas, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, Nauru, Nepal, Nicobar Is., Northern Territory, Ogasawara-shoto, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Queensland, Rodrigues, R\u00e9union, South China Sea, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Taiwan, Thailand, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. It is also found in Western Australia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open forests. It is known for its hairy, showy flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its wide distribution suggests a high adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum was mainly introduced to Brazil North, Chagos Archipelago, Colombia, Comoros, Cuba, Fiji, Haiti, Hawaii, Iraq, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Line Is., Madeira, Niue, Norfolk Is., Peru, Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Seychelles, Society Is., Tokelau-Manihiki, Trinidad-Tobago, Tuamotu, Tubuai Is., Turks-Caicos Is., Wake I., and Windward Is. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and coastal zones. This plant has become naturalized in many of these locations, sometimes forming dense thickets. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including trade and accidental seed dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
