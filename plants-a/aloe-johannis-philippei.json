It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the winter months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
