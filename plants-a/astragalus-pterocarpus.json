    "intro": "Astragalus pterocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus pterocarpus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
