    "intro": "Aroides, commonly known as arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant's underground stems, called rhizomes, are the primary part used for culinary purposes. Arrowroot is valued for its starchy texture and neutral flavor, making it a popular thickening agent in cooking. It also has medicinal uses, particularly in traditional remedies for digestive issues."
