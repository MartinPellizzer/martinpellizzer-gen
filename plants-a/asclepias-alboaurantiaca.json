    "intro": "Asclepias alboaurantiaca, commonly known as the white and orange milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-like flowers that range from white to orange in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common to many milkweed species. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias alboaurantiaca serves as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant in supporting pollinators."
