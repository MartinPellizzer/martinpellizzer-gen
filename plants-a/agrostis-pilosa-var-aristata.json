It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, low-growing habit, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
