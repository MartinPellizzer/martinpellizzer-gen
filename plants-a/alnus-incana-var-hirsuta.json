    "intro": "Alnus incana var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
