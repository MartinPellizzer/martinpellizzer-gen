    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, oval leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
