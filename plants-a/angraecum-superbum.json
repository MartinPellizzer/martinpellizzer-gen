    "intro": "Angraecum superbum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Angraecum superbum is notable for its unique adaptation to its specific ecological niche and is a symbol of Madagascar's rich biodiversity."
