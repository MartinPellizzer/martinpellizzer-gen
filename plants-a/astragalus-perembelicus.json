    "intro": "Astragalus perembelicus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Astragalus perembelicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid and semi-arid landscapes."
