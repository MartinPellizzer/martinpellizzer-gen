    "intro": "Androsace turczaninowii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
