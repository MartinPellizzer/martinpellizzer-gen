It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitat. It is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical structure is adapted to coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
