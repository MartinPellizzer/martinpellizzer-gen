    "intro": "Aristida capensis var. macropus, commonly known as the Cape grass or broad-leaved lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
