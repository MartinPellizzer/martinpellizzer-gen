The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
