    "intro": "Aristolochia transsecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically purple or brown in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant of caution."
