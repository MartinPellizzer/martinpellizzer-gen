    "intro": "Aspidium forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in humid climates."
