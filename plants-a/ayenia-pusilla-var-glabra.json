    "intro": "Ayenia pusilla var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth ayenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
