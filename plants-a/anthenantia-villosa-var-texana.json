    "intro": "Anthenantia villosa var. texana, commonly known as the Texas holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its evergreen nature makes it a valuable ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
