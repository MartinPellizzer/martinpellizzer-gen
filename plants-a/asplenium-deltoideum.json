    "intro": "Asplenium deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a contrasting lighter midrib. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters. Asplenium deltoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
