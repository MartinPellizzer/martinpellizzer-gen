    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically 3\u20138 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in moist forests. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
