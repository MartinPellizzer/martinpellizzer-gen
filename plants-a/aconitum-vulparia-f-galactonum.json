    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia f. galactonum, commonly known as the Milky Monkshood, is a variant of the monkshood plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, and its dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that contains various alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display.",
