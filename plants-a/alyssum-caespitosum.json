    "intro": "Alyssum caespitosum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Alyssum caespitosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
