It is a perennial grass with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically shorter than the standard variety. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
