    "intro": "Achatocarpus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or greenish, and it produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots, contributing to soil fertility. The species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.",
