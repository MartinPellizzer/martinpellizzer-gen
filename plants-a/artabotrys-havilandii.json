    "intro": "Artabotrys havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (carambola). It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
