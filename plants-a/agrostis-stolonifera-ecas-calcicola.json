    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera ecas. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing,\u530d\u5310\u830e (stolons) that enable it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
