    "intro": "Acalypha macrostachya f. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgyna Acalypha, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often a vibrant green with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya f. androgyna is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in lowland areas with rich soil. It is also occasionally found in the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions with similar ecological conditions. Its natural range extends across parts of Australia and the Pacific, where it adapts well to diverse microhabitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya f. androgyna was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and vacant lots. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native plant communities by outcompeting local flora for resources."
