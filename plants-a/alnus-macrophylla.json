    "intro": "Alnus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Alnus macrophylla is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
