    "intro": "Asplenium auricularium var. acutidens, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, evergreen epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the lower leaflets. It produces spores in sori that are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This variety is closely related to other spleenworts and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
