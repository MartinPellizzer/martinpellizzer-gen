    "intro": "Adiantum mynsseniae, commonly known as the Mysore maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a maidenhair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Adiantum mynsseniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
