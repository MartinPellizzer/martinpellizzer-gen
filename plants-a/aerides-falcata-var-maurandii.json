    "intro": "Aerides falcata var. maurandii, commonly known as the Mauritius orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
