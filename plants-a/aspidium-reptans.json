    "intro": "Aspidium reptans, commonly known as the running brake, is a fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds."
