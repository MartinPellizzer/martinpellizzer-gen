It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium mettenianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
