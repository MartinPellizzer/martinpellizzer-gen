It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in racemes, and it produces flat, elongated pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
