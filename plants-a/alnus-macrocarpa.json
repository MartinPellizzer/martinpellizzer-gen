    "intro": "Alnus macrocarpa, commonly known as the big-seed alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in open woodlands. Alnus macrocarpa plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
