    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon jaliscanum is primarily native to Mexico, specifically the state of Jalisco. It is also found in parts of central and southern Mexico, including the states of Guanajuato, Michoac\u00e1n, and Oaxaca. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. Abutilon jaliscanum is a shrub or small tree that plays a role in local ecosystems and has some traditional uses in indigenous communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon jaliscanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as along streambanks and in forest understories. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by water and animals. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
