    "intro": "Amygdalus nana vulgaris, commonly known as the dwarf almond. It is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its small, rounded leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible nuts that are similar to those of the common almond, though they are generally smaller and less commercially valuable. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes and as a source of edible nuts."
