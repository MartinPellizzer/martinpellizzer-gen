    "intro": "Andropogon serratus, commonly known as the sawtooth grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. Andropogon serratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
