    "intro": "Asclepias amabilis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias amabilis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
