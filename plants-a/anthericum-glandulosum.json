    "intro": "Anthericum glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance. Anthericum glandulosum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
