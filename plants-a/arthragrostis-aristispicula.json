It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, two-lobed flowers. Arthragrostis aristispicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
