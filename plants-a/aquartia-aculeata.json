    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aquadria aculeata, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant is found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic invertebrates, aiding in its nutrient uptake. Aquartia aculeata is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
