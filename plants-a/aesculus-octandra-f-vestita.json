    "intro": "Aesculus octandra f. vestita, commonly known as the velvet horse chestnut, is a botanical variant of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant is native to parts of the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in panicles. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains shiny, edible seeds, though the plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value."
