It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Amoria angulata is often found in open, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
