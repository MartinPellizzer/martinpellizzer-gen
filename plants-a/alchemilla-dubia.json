    "intro": "Alchemilla dubia, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla dubia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
