    "intro": "Asplenium fugax, commonly known as the temporary fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its short, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium fugax thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ephemeral nature, with fronds often dying back quickly after spore release, contributes to its common name."
