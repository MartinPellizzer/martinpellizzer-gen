It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
