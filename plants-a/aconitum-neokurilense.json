    "intro": "Aconitum neokurilense, commonly known as the Kuril monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Russian Far East and the northern regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
