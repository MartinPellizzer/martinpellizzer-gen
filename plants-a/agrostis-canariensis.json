    "intro": "Agrostis canariensis, commonly known as Canary grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands and parts of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
