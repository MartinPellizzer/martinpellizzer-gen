    "intro": "Asplenium amaurophyllum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium amaurophyllum is found in temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
