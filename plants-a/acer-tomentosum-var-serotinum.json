    "intro": "Acer tomentosum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by red-orange samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to other maple species.",
