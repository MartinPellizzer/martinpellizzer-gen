This species is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed forests and rocky slopes. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse topography of central and southern China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer davidii subsp. grosseri was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it is valued for its autumn color and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This subspecies is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for ecological purposes. While it is not native to the region, it has become a popular choice for urban and suburban planting. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on local ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled environments."
