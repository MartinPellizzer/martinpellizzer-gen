    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum congestum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Baja California and Sonora. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in desert and semi-desert environments. It is commonly associated with areas that have low rainfall and high temperatures. Its native range includes habitats such as creosote bush scrub and chaparral.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum congestum was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in coastal and sandy environments. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and erosion control. However, it has also shown potential to become a weed in some regions."
