    "intro": "Amphicosmia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's amphicosmia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
