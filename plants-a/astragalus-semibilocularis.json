    "intro": "Astragalus semibilocularis, commonly known as the two-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus semibilocularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
