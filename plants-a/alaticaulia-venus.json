    "intro": "Alaticaulia venus, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of pale lavender flowers that emit a subtle, fragrant aroma. The plant's leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in cool, humid environments. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer, making it a sought-after specimen among botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
