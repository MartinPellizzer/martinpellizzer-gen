    "intro": "Arnica montana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties. This variant is less common than the typical arnica and is valued for its potential therapeutic uses."
