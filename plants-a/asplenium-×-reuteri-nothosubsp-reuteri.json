    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 reuteri nothosubsp. reuteri, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid in the Aspleniaceae family."
