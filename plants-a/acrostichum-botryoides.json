    "intro": "Acrostichum botryoides, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves. This fern is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native habitats.",
