    "intro": "Asplenium dacicum, commonly known as the Dacian spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Balkan region. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium dacicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
