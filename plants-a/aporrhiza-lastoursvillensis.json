    "intro": "Aporrhiza lastoursvillensis, commonly known as the Lastoursville sea fan, is a species of gorgonian coral found in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate skeletons. The polyps of this coral are covered in flexible, feathery tentacles that extend during feeding. It typically inhabits shallow reef environments and is often found in association with other marine organisms. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in reef biodiversity and habitat provision."
