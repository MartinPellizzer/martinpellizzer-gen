    "intro": "Alysicarpus rugosus var. pilifer, commonly known as hairy burr vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with hairy surfaces and produces distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
