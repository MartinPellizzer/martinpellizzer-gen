    "intro": "Aristida fasciculata var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, bristly spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects in dry regions."
