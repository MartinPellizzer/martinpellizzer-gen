    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. rubristipula, commonly known as the red-stippled lady\u2019s mantle, is a variant of the lady\u2019s mantle plant characterized by its distinctive red veins on the leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in clay soils. The red-stippled variation is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
