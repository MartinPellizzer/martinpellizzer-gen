    "intro": "Aloe acinacifolia, commonly known as the sword aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The leaves are typically green with red or orange margins, and they store water to help the plant survive in arid conditions. It produces tall, branched flower stalks with yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
