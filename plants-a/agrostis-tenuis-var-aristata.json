    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. aristata, commonly known as slender bentgrass with awns, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bract-like structures, which are distinctive in appearance. Its leaves are generally smooth and have a slight bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its resilience and ability to form dense, uniform turf in landscaping and restoration projects."
