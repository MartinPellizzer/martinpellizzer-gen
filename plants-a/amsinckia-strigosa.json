    "intro": "Amsinckia strigosa, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is known for its medicinal and ornamental plants. Amsinckia strigosa is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
