    "intro": "Agrostis alpina proles schleicheri, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically forms dense mats, which provide erosion control and habitat for alpine flora and fauna. It prefers well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
