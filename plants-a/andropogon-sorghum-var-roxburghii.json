    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. roxburghii, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional landscaping."
