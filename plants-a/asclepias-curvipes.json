    "intro": "Asclepias curvipes, commonly known as the coral milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers, which are arranged in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The plant has distinctive, waxy, green leaves with a somewhat zigzagged appearance. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias curvipes plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
