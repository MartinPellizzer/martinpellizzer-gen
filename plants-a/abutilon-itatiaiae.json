This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of this region. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in secondary vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon itatiaiae was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses because of its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, spreading beyond cultivated areas. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. As a result, it is now considered a potential weed in certain parts of the continent."
