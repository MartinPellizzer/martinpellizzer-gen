    "intro": "Aconitum plicatum subsp. plicatum, commonly known as the crested aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that are often adorned with wavy, folded margins. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in tall, sparsely branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
