    "intro": "Aspidium molliculum var. cheilanthoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
