It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region.",
