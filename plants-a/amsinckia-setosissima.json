    "intro": "Amsinckia setosissima, commonly known as the desert flax or hairy flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Amsinckia setosissima is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats."
