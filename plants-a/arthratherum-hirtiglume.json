    "intro": "Arthratherum hirtiglume, commonly known as the hairy glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive hairy structures on the glumes, which are the bracts that enclose the florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Arthratherum hirtiglume plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
