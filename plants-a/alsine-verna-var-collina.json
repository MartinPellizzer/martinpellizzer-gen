    "intro": "Alsine verna var. collina, commonly known as the mountain alsike, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread in rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
