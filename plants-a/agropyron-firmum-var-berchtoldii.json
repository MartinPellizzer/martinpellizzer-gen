    "intro": "Agropyron firmum var. berchtoldii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This hardy species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration ecology projects."
