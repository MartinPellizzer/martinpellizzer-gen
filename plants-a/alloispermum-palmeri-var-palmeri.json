It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
