    "intro": "Alstonia angustiloba var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alstonia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
