It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in the mountainous regions of these countries. This variant is known for its lack of thorns, distinguishing it from the typical form of Acanthopanax spinosus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax spinosus var. inermis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in open woodlands and shrublands. It is often found in areas with moderate rainfall and partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological conditions. This plant is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe as a decorative shrub. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
