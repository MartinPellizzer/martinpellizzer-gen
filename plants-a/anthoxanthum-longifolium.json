    "intro": "Anthoxanthum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a valuable component of biodiversity-rich habitats."
