    "intro": "Aspidium angulatum, commonly known as the angled water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium angulatum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
