    "intro": "Astragalus schanginianus var. gymnocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are small and often have a distinctive, smooth texture, which contributes to its common name. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
