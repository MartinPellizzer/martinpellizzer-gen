It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy and Spain. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.",
