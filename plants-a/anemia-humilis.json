    "intro": "Anemia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anemia humilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
