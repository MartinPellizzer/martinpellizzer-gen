    "intro": "Argostemma inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-sided argostemma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
