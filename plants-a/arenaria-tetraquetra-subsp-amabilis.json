It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
