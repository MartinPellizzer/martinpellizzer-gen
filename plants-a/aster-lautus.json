    "intro": "Aster lautus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Aster lautus is often found in moist woodlands and prairies, thriving in partial to full sunlight. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
