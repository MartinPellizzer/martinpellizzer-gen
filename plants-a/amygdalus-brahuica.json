It is native to the western Himalayas and is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that contain a single almond-like seed. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
