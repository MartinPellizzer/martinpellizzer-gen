    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. typica, commonly known as ground-ivy or false shamrock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue or purple flowers in the spring. The plant spreads via rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
