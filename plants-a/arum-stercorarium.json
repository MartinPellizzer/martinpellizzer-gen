It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces a foul-smelling odor to attract carrion flies for pollination. Its leaves are large, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
