It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that distinguish it from the typical form of the species. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in forested areas. Its botanical features include small, clustered flowers and fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
