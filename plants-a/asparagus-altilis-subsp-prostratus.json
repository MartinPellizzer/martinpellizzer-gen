    "intro": "Asparagus altilis subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate asparagus, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments."
