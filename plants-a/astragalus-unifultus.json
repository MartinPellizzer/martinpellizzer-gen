    "intro": "Astragalus unifultus, commonly known as the single-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to green flowers clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus unifultus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
