    "intro": "Allocasuarina media, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Allocasuarina media is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
