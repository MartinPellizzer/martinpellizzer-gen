    "intro": "Aristolochia poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic odor. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific flies that are attracted to the plant's scent and appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
