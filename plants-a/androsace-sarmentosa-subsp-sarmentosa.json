    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa subsp. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, cold climates and poor soil conditions."
