    "intro": "Agrostis densissima, commonly known as dense hairgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis densissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
