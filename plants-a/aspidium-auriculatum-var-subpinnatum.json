    "intro": "Aspidium auriculatum var. subpinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the pinnae. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
