    "intro": "Asplenium carruthersii, commonly known as the Carruthers' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium carruthersii is often found growing on limestone or in areas with high humidity, making it a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
