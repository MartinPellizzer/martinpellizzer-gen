    "intro": "Acrostichum unitum, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.",
