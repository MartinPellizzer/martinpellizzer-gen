    "intro": "Asplenium suppositum, commonly known as the False Bird's Nest, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It has a rosette-shaped growth pattern with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or near streams. Its unique appearance and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
