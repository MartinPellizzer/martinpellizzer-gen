    "intro": "Achnatherum inaequiglume, commonly known as the unequal-glume needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are usually two-ranked, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones, giving it its specific epithet. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Achnatherum inaequiglume is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance.",
