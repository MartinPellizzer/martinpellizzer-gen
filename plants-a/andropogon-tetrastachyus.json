    "intro": "Andropogon tetrastachyus, commonly known as the African switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown florets, which are arranged in multiple tiers, giving it its specific epithet \"tetrastachyus.\" It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a potential bioenergy crop."
