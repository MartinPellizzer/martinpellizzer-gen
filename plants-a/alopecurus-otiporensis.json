It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Alopecurus otiporensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
