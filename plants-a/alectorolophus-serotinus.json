    "intro": "Alectorolophus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom late in the growing season. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and moths. Alectorolophus serotinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
