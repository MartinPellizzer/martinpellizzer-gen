    "intro": "Antennaria austromontana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antennaria austromontana is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and cool, moist conditions."
