    "intro": "Arenaria minima, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry meadows. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria minima is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments."
