    "intro": "Aspalathus florulenta, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Aspalathus florulenta is closely related to the commercially important rooibos plant, but it is less commonly cultivated."
