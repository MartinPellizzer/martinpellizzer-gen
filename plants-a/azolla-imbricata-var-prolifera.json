    "intro": "Azolla imbricata var. prolifera, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has a unique ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in reducing sunlight penetration and controlling algae growth. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized leaves that are often different in shape from the vegetative leaves. This variety is widely used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to improve water quality."
