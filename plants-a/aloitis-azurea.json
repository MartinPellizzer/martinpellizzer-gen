    "intro": "Aloitis azurea, commonly known as the blue aloes, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid landscapes."
