    "intro": "Allium lacunosum var. kernense, commonly known as Kern's garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is closely related to other allium species, including garlic and onions, and shares similar botanical features. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
