    "intro": "Amberboa lancifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved amberboa, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves and stems contain resinous compounds that give it a distinct, aromatic scent. Amberboa lancifolia is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils."
