    "intro": "Ananas, commonly known as pineapple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is cultivated worldwide for its edible fruit. The plant features a rosette of spiny, sword-shaped leaves that collect water in their central cavity. The fruit develops from the flowering stem, which grows upward after the plant has matured. The outer skin is covered in a tough, fibrous layer called the \"bark,\" while the interior contains juicy, aromatic segments."
