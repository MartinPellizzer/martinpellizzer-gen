    "intro": "Aristida trachyantha, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, dense inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in panicles. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Aristida trachyantha is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
