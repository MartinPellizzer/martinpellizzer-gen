It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features small, orbicular (globular) fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Aspidium globuliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
