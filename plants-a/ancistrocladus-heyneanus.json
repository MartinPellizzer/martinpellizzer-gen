It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Despite its common name, it has limited use in traditional medicine and is not widely cultivated."
