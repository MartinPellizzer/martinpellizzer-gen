    "intro": "Arenaria arenarioides var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that help it conserve water. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
