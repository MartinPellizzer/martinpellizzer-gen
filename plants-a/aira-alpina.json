    "intro": "Aira alpina, commonly known as alpine airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. This plant is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and tundra habitats. Aira alpina is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
