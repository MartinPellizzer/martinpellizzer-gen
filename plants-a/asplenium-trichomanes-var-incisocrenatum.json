    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. incisocrenatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. This variety is distinguished by its finely incised leaf margins and its relatively small size, making it a subtle yet resilient component of woodland and cliff habitats."
