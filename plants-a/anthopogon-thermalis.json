    "intro": "Anthopogon thermalis, commonly known as the thermal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a dense, compact growth habit. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Anthopogon thermalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
