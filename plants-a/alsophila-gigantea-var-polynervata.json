    "intro": "Alsophila gigantea var. polynervata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish outer layer and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
