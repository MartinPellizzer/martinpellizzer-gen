It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
