    "intro": "Acalypha conspicua, commonly known as the flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flames, consisting of red, orange, and yellow bracts. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Acalypha conspicua is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha conspicua is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf region. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with ample sunlight. Acalypha conspicua is often seen growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. Its native range includes parts of the southern United States and northern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha conspicua was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its vibrant leaf colors. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
