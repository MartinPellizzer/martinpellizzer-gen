    "intro": "Astragalus trichopodus var. phoxus, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and gray-green in appearance. This species is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
