    "intro": "Adonis alpina, commonly known as the alpine adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with prominent orange markings. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. Adonis alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments.",
