    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. praecox, commonly known as early sand-amaranth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom early in the growing season. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
