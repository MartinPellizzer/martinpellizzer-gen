    "intro": "Astragalus bungei, commonly known as the Bunge milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments. Astragalus bungei is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
