    "intro": "Alaticaulia oscitans, commonly known as the silent stalked orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its slender, often upright stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged along the stem, contributing to its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
