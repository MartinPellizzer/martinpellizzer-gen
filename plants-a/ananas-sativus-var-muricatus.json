    "intro": "Ananas sativus var. muricatus, commonly known as the rough pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its textured, spiky leaves and a more robust flavor profile compared to the typical pineapple. It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. The plant produces a fruit that is often smaller and more intensely flavored than the common pineapple, with a distinctive, rough exterior. Its cultivation is less widespread due to its demanding growth conditions and the challenges of its spiky foliage. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its unique culinary qualities."
