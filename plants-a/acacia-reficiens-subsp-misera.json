    "intro": "Acacia reficiens subsp. misera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, narrow phyllodes that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia reficiens subsp. misera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. The plant is often seen growing along roadsides and in open grasslands. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia reficiens subsp. misera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and urban areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
