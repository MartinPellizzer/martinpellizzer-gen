    "intro": "Acer capillipes, commonly known as the slender maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer capillipes is primarily native to Japan. It is found in various regions across the country, including Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. It is a small to medium-sized tree known for its distinctive leaf structure. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer capillipes was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions. It thrives in environments where it can receive adequate water without becoming waterlogged. This plant is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common ornamental species in horticulture."
