    "intro": "Aporosa villosa, commonly known as the hairy aporosa, is a woody climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Aporosa villosa is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
