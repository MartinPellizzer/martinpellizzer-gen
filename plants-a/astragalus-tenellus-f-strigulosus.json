    "intro": "Astragalus tenellus f. strigulosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
