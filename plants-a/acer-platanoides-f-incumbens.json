It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions across Europe, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",
