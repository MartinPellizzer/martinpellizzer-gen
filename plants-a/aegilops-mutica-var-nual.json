    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. nual, commonly known as the rough goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaf blades, and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields as a weed. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in semi-arid environments."
