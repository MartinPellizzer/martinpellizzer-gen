    "intro": "Arundo recta, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of pale green to brown flowers in late summer. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
