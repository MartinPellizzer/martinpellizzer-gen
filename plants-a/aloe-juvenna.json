    "intro": "Aloe juvenna, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Aloe juvenna is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
