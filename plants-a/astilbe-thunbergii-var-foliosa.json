    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii var. foliosa, commonly known as the fernleaf astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features finely cut, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces panicles of plume-like flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide color and texture in shaded landscapes."
