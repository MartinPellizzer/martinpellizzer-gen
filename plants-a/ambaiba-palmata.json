    "intro": "Ambaiba palmata, commonly known as the yellow palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically a striking yellow or golden color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits resembling small, round coconuts. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Ambaiba palmata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitats."
