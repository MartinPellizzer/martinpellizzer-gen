It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
