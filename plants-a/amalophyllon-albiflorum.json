    "intro": "Amalophyllon albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered amalophyllon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are small but emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
