    "intro": "Alchemilla subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from the harsh cold of high altitudes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cup-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Alchemilla subnivalis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows."
