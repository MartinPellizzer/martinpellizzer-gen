    "intro": "Achatocarpus spinulosus, commonly known as the prickly burr or spiny burr, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody shrub form and distinctive spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The spiny pods, which contain the seeds, are adapted for attachment to animals or clothing, facilitating its spread to new areas.",
