    "intro": "Astragalus speirocarpus, commonly known as the spiralcarpus milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus speirocarpus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
