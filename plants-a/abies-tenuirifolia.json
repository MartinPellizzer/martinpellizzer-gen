    "intro": "Abies tenuirifolia, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are light green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies tenuirifolia is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. It is particularly associated with the eastern and central parts of the Himalayan range. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies tenuirifolia was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its dense, pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a windbreak or hedge. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate air pollution, making it suitable for urban environments. However, it requires protection from extreme temperatures and is not well-suited for areas with hot, dry summers."
