    "intro": "Atriplex canescens subsp. linearis, commonly known as green burro bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its linear, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
