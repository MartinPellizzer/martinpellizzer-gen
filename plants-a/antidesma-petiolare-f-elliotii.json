    "intro": "Antidesma petiolare f. elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variation and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
