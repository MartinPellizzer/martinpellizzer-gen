    "intro": "Anthriscus alpestris, commonly known as meadow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in meadows, woodlands, and rocky soils, often in moist or shaded areas. Anthriscus alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
