    "intro": "Astragalus kneuckeri, commonly known as the Kneucker's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seed pods, which contain small, kidney-shaped seeds, are an important part of its reproductive cycle. Astragalus kneuckeri is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
