    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. elatior, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in forage and erosion control."
