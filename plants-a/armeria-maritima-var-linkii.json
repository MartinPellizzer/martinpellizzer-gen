    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. linkii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal environments."
