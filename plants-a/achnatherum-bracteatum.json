    "intro": "Achnatherum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Achnatherum bracteatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.",
