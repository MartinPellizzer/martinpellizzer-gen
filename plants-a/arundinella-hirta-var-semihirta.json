    "intro": "Arundinella hirta var. semihirta, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or semihairy bamboo, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a common ornamental and ecological plant in wetland areas. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching material."
