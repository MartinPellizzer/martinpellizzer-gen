    "intro": "Avena hirsuta, commonly known as hairy oat, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, each with a two-lobed lemma. Avena hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
