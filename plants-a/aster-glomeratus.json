    "intro": "Aster glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers in the fall. Its flowering period is late summer to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. Aster glomeratus is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
