    "intro": "Aloe perfoliata var. succotrina, commonly known as the succulent aloe, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on branched inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
