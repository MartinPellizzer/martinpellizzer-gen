    "intro": "Aulotandra humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's aulotandra, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and clustering growth habit. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish or white in color, and it produces berries as its fruit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aulotandra humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
