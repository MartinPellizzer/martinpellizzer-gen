    "intro": "Adenostemma macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the milkweed genus, which can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Adenostemma macrophyllum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.",
