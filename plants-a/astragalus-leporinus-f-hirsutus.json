    "intro": "Astragalus leporinus f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy bison milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the legume family. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
