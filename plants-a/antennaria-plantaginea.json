    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginea, commonly known as the sticky willow or sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, mat-like formations, often resembling a cushion. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Antennaria plantaginea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes and disturbed areas."
