    "intro": "Agropyron kamoji f. villosulum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
