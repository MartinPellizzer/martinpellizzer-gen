    "intro": "Agrimonia microcarpa, commonly known as narrowleaf agrimony, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are tiny, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Agrimonia microcarpa is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
