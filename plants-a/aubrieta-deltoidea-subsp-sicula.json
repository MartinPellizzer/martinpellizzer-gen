It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
