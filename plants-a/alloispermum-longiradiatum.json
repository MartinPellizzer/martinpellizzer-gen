    "intro": "Alloispermum longiradiatum, commonly known as the long-rayed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with five pink to purple petals, often surrounded by bright yellow stamens. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Alloispermum longiradiatum is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
