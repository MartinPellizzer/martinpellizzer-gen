    "intro": "Asplenium macrophlebium, commonly known as the broad-veined spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often divided into smaller segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium macrophlebium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
