    "intro": "Angraecum mirabile, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and large, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive white and violet coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar at the flower's base. Angraecum mirabile is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
