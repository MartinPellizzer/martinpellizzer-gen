    "intro": "Angraecum gravenreutii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that bear numerous white to pale pink, star-shaped blossoms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, airy substrates to prevent root rot. Its nocturnal pollination strategy involves specific moths that are adapted to its unique floral structure. Angraecum gravenreutii is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and ecological significance."
