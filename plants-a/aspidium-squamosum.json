    "intro": "Aspidium squamosum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, scaly fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Aspidium squamosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
