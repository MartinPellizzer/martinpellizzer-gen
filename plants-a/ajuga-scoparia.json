    "intro": "Ajuga scoparia, commonly known as carpet grass or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense ground cover."
