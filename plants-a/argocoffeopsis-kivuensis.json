    "intro": "Argocoffeopsis kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu coffee tree, is a species native to the Albertine Rift region of Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee and related plants. The plant is characterized by its evergreen habit, lanceolate leaves, and small, white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are drupes that mature to a red or orange color, containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
