    "intro": "Alnus sibirica var. tinctoria, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, egg-shaped nuts in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
