    "intro": "Asplenium serra, commonly known as the serrate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium serra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
