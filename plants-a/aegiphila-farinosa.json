    "intro": "Aegiphila farinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sand verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aegiphila farinosa is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
