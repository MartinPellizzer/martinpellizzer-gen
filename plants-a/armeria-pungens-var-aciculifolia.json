    "intro": "Armeria pungens var. aciculifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaved thrift, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive needle-like, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to rose-colored flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its low-growing form and ornamental foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in dry, sunny landscapes."
