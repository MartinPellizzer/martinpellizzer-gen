    "intro": "Archidendron clypearia subsp. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved legume, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It has compound leaves with alternate, elliptical leaflets that are covered in a rough, coriaceous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in dry, open woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
