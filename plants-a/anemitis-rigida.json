    "intro": "Anemitis rigida, commonly known as the rigid anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a short, stout stem with palmately divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Anemitis rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
