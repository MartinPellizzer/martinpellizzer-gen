    "intro": "Anisopappus inuloides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and branched. It produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by pale yellow to brownish pappus-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
