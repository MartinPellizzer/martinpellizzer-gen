    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 fiekii var. silesiaca, commonly known as the Silesian alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its deciduous nature and rapid growth. It typically features compound leaves with serrated margins and small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its colonization of disturbed soils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
