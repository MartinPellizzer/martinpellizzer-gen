    "intro": "Actaea cimicifuga, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its roots are the primary part used in herbal medicine, valued for their potential hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties. Actaea cimicifuga thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.",
