It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces bulbous structures that store nutrients. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
