It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowering heads consist of blue to purple ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late summer to early fall. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
