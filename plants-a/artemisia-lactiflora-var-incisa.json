    "intro": "Artemisia lactiflora var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mugwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in compact, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its aromatic properties make it notable in both traditional medicine and ecological systems."
