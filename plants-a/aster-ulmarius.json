    "intro": "Aster ulmarius, commonly known as the elm-leaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, resembling the foliage of elm trees. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially sunny areas. Aster ulmarius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
