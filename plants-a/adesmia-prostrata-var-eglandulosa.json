    "intro": "Adesmia prostrata var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adesmia, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant ecology.",
