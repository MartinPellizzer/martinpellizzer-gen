    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile f. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura aethionema, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Alps. It is a compact, low-growing plant with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphological features."
