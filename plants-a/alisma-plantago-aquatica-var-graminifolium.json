    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a wetland plant native to Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves and roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
