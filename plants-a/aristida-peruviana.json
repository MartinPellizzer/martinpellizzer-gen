    "intro": "Aristida peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aristida peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
