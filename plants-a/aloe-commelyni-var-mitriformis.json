    "intro": "Aloe commelyni var. mitriformis, commonly known as the helmet aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their healing properties. This species is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
