    "intro": "Amblovenatum distinctum, commonly known as the rare velvet fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, carpet-like appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or brown, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Amblovenatum distinctum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
