    "intro": "Arthropodium imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain fern or velvet fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, overlapping fronds that give it a velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread and form extensive colonies. Arthropodium imbricatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
