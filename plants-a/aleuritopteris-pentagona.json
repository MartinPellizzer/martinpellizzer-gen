    "intro": "Aleuritopteris pentagona, commonly known as the pentagon fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive pentagonal shape in cross-section, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions."
