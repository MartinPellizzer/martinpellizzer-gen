It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
