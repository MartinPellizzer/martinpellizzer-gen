    "intro": "Aira praecox, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Aira praecox is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
