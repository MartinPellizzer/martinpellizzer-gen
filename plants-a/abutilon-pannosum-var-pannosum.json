This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in dry habitats such as deserts, scrublands, and coastal areas. The species is well adapted to hot and dry climates, making it a resilient plant in these regions. Its native range spans across several continents, including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum was mainly introduced to Aldabra, Mauritius, and Rodrigues. It is believed to have been introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in these regions, often growing in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied."
