    "intro": "Agave victoriae-reginae f. longispina, commonly known as the Queen of the Night Agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are adorned with white to pale blue marginal teeth. The plant produces a dramatic inflorescence of white flowers that bloom only at night, a feature that gives it its common name. Its leaves are robust and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. This unique plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
