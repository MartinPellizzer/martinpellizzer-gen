    "intro": "Astragalus leucophyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus leucophyllus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
