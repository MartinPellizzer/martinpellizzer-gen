    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthostemma longifolium is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions. Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostemma longifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native species for resources. Its distribution is now widespread across the North Island and parts of the South Island."
