    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas f. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, pale green fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, elongated fronds that are often divided into multiple pinnae. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas."
