    "intro": "Antennaria howellii subsp. gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Canada. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from May to June. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs and dunes, often in areas with high exposure. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited to the harsh maritime environment of the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula."
