    "intro": "Andromeda glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces bell-shaped, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open habitats such as heaths and woodlands. Andromeda glandulosa is native to the eastern United States and is often found in the southeastern region."
