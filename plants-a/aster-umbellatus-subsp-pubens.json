    "intro": "Aster umbellatus subsp. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves and stems, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
