It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall, are blue to purple and have five petals. Aster hybernus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators in woodland ecosystems."
