It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing along forest edges or in disturbed habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha decumbens var. cordata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often used as a ground cover or in mixed borders because of its spreading growth habit. It prefers partial to full sun and is relatively easy to maintain. However, it has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
