    "intro": "Antennaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features dense, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for the similar-looking but non-native mouse-ear (Antennaria dioica). It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and rocky slopes. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically pale yellow to white, adding a subtle floral presence to its natural environment."
