    "intro": "Aspidium depariopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium depariopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
