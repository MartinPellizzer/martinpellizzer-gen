    "intro": "Aulomyrcia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf aulomyrcia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are leathery and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Aulomyrcia acutifolia is often found in shaded, moist undergrowth where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest floor."
