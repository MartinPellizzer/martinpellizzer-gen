    "intro": "Alocasia epilithica, commonly known as the stone-attached alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often with intricate patterns and a vibrant green color. The plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique growth habit, where it attaches itself to rocks or tree trunks, gives it a distinctive appearance. Alocasia epilithica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
