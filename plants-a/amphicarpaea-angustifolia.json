    "intro": "Amphicarpaea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a unique adaptation known as amphicarpism. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
