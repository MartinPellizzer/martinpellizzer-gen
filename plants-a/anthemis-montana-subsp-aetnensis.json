    "intro": "Anthemis montana subsp. aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna Anthemis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the high-altitude environments of Mount Etna. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
