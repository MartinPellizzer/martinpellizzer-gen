    "intro": "Anagallis pumila var. barbata, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from spring to summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its common name, and are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. This variety is distinct from the typical form of Anagallis pumila due to its more densely hairy foliage and slightly different flower morphology."
