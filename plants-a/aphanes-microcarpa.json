    "intro": "Aphanes microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Aphanes microcarpa is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas."
