    "intro": "Andruris, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Andruris is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
