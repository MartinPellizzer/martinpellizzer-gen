    "intro": "Agalinis megalantha, commonly known as the large-flowered false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, often in sandy or loamy soils. It produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its often arid environment."
