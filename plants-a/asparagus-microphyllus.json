    "intro": "Asparagus microphyllus, commonly known as the silver asparagus or dwarf asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and its stems are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested before they fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as both a garden plant and a cut flower."
