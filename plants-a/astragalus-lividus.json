    "intro": "Astragalus lividus, commonly known as the bluish milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, and it produces pods that contain small, round seeds. Astragalus lividus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
