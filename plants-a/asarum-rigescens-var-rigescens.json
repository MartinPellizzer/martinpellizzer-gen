    "intro": "Asarum rigescens var. rigescens, commonly known as the broadleaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a dense umbel, typically blooming in late spring. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
