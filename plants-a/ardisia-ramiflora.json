    "intro": "Ardisia ramiflora, commonly known as the fragrant flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Ardisia ramiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
