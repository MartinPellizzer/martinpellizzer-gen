    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthorhiza chuco is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within these countries. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the Andes. It is not found outside of this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthorhiza chuco was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of South America and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, making it a potential invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its successful establishment in non-native locations. However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data."
