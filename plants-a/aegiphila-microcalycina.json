    "intro": "Aegiphila microcalycina, commonly known as the small calyx aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple in color. Aegiphila microcalycina is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
