    "intro": "Astragalus spicatus, commonly known as spiculate milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus spicatus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
