    "intro": "Asplenium capense, commonly known as the Cape spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped fronds. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the leaves in clusters called sori. Asplenium capense is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
