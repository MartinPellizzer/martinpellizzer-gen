    "intro": "Anthurium martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from deep red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are surrounded by the striking spatulate leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium martinezii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
