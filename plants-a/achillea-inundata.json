    "intro": "Achillea inundata, commonly known as the water yarrow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, streambanks, and other wet habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Achillea inundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.",
