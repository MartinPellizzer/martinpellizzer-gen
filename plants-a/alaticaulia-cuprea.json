    "intro": "Alaticaulia cuprea, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. Alaticaulia cuprea is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
