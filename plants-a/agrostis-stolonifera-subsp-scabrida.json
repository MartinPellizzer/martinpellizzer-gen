    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. scabrida, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and creeping growth habit, with stolons forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in lawns, meadows, and along streambanks. Its foliage is usually a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and adaptability."
