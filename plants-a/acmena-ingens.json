    "intro": "Acmena ingens, commonly known as the giant acmena, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Acmena ingens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its dense canopy and shade-providing qualities. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting a variety of wildlife species.",
