    "intro": "Artemisia roezlii, commonly known as the Ro\u00ebzli's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and stems, contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Artemisia roezlii is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
