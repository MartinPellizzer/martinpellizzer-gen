It is characterized by its unique, candle-like appearance, with elongated, cylindrical stems that often have a waxy coating. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, and the flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences. Andenea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their distinctive morphology and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
