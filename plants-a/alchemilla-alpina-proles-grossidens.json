    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina proles grossidens, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. This species thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
