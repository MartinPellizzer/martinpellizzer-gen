    "intro": "Arenaria fragillima, commonly known as the fragile sandpink, is a low-growing plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, windy conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in limited, specialized habitats."
