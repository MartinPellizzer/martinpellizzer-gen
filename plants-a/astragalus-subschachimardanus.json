    "intro": "Astragalus subschachimardanus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, and it produces small, hard pods that contain the seeds."
