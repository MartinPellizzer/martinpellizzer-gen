    "intro": "Agriophyllum montasirii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Agriophyllum montasirii is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
