    "intro": "Apalatoa acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Apalatoa acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
