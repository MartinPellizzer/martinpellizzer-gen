It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia opulenta thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in woodlands and open fields. Its aromatic leaves and resilience make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for garden use."
