    "intro": "Aster pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Aster pinnatifidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
