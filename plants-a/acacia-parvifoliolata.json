    "intro": "Acacia parvifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow or golden flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals or through mechanical means. Acacia parvifoliolata is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia parvifoliolata is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and savanna-like habitats. It is well adapted to the warm and often dry climate of Queensland. Its distribution is largely confined to the eastern and central parts of the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia parvifoliolata was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance. It has since been cultivated in various regions with similar climates, including parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its low maintenance requirements. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
