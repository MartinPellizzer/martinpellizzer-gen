It is found in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oraria var. amblyphylla was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation programs. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. This variety is often used in urban and rural landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental qualities. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond its intended areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is closely monitored to ensure it does not disrupt local ecosystems."
