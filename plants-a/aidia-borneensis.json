    "intro": "Aidia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean aidia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are clustered in cymes. Aidia borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
