    "intro": "Arctium grandifolium, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in a thistle-like cluster, followed by spiky, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root is thick and fleshy, often harvested for medicinal purposes. Arctium grandifolium thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
