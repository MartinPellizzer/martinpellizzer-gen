    "intro": "Alangium guadalcanalense, commonly known as the Guadalcanal alangium, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
