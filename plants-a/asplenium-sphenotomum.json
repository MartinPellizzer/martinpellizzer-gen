    "intro": "Asplenium sphenotomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium sphenotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
