    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. albomaculatum, commonly known as the white-spotted maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are often adorned with white or pale yellow spots. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that have elongated wings. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. The white-spotted maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. albomaculatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at high altitudes, often found in dense forests and along stream banks. This species is commonly associated with rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic element of mountain ecosystems. Its natural range extends into parts of northern Vietnam and western Myanmar. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in isolated populations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. albomaculatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique leaf characteristics. This subspecies is prized for its striking white-veined leaves that provide visual interest in landscapes. It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. The plant's aesthetic appeal has led to its use in both public and private gardens. However, it is important to note that it is not typically invasive in its introduced range."
