    "intro": "Astragalus brachyceras, commonly known as the short-horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus brachyceras is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
