It is characterized by its distinctive capsule fruits that split into two valves when mature, releasing seeds. The plants typically have hairy, alternate leaves and produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Acroschizocarpus species are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance as food sources for certain insects."
