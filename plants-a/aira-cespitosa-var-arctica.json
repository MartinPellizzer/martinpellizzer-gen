    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic false oat, is a perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments."
