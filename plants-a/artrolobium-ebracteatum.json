    "intro": "Artrolobium ebracteatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Artrolobium ebracteatum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
