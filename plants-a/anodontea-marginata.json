    "intro": "Anodontea marginata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal zones and marshes. The plant has small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Anodontea marginata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
