    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, making it a valuable groundcover in natural habitats."
