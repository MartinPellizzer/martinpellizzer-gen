It is characterized by its showy purple or blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a tall, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its scientific name reflects its intricate, net-like pattern on the petals, which is a distinguishing feature. Aster reticulatus is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
