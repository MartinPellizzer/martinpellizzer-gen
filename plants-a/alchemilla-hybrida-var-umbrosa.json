It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, velvety leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla hybrida var. umbrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in damp conditions."
