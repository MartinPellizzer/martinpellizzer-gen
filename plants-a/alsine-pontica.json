    "intro": "Alsine pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Alsine pontica plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
