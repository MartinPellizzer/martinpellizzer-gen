    "intro": "Asplenium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Central America. Asplenium guatemalense is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
