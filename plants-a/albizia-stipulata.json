    "intro": "Albizia stipulata, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia stipulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
