    "intro": "Asplenium nigropilosum, commonly known as the black-hairy spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, black hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium nigropilosum is often found in temperate regions and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
