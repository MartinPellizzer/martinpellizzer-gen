    "intro": "Abutilon bicolor, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Abutilon bicolor is also known for its ability to grow as a shrub or small tree, depending on environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bicolor is primarily native to Argentina South and Chile Central. This species is commonly found in the temperate regions of these areas. It thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bicolor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has since become naturalized in various coastal and disturbed areas across the region. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along roadsides, stream banks, and open forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Efforts to control its spread have been ongoing due to its impact on native ecosystems."
