    "intro": "Astragalus megaloceras, commonly known as the giant-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus megaloceras plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
