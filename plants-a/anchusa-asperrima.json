    "intro": "Anchusa asperrima, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, rayless flowers that bloom in dense, flat-topped clusters during the summer months. Anchusa asperrima is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and architectural form, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
