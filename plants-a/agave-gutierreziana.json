    "intro": "Agave gutierreziana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white to yellow marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Agave gutierreziana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
