    "intro": "Aconitum laeve var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are smooth and waxy in texture. The plant produces striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
