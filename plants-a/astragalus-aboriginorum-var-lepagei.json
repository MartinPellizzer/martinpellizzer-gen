    "intro": "Astragalus aboriginorum var. lepagei, commonly known as the Northern Sand Verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it often grows in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and hairy, aiding in water conservation."
