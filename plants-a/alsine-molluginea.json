    "intro": "Alsine molluginea, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in disturbed soils, such as those found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are oval-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Alsine molluginea is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional herbal medicine."
