    "intro": "Adonis cyllenea var. paryadrica, commonly known as the Paryadric Adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its flowering period is short, lasting only a few weeks, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
