It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and elongated awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has small, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
