    "intro": "Astragalus pachystachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, spikelike clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus pachystachys is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential medicinal properties."
