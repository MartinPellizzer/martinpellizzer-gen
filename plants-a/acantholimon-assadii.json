    "intro": "Acantholimon assadii, commonly known as the Assad's thornscale, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its blooming period occurs during the spring, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon assadii was mainly introduced to areas with rocky soils and arid conditions, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Levant and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, well-drained environments. This plant is often associated with limestone and sandstone substrates, making it a characteristic species of rocky habitats. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its natural distribution and adaptation to harsh climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
