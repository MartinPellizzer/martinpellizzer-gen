    "intro": "Astragalus hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
