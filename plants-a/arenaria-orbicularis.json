    "intro": "Arenaria orbicularis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Its compact growth form makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
