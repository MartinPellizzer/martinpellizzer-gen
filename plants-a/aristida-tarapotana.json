    "intro": "Aristida tarapotana, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Aristida tarapotana plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is of interest for its ecological and potential horticultural value."
