    "intro": "Antennaria callilepis, commonly known as the sticky haircup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs that aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores. Antennaria callilepis is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
