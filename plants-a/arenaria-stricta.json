    "intro": "Arenaria stricta, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant has small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. Arenaria stricta is well adapted to harsh environments and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
