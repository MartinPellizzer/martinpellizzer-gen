    "intro": "Aulomyrcia doniana, commonly known as the Brazilian white cedar, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elliptical fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
