    "intro": "Acopanea, commonly known as the \"false poinsettia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of a single species, Acopanea schottii, which is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the leaves of a poinsettia, though it is not related to the true poinsettia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Acopanea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
