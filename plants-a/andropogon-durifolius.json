    "intro": "Andropogon durifolius, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in native grassland ecosystems."
