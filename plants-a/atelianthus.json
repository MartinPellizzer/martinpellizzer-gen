    "intro": "Atelianthus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in grasslands and open habitats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in a composite head that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Atelianthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
