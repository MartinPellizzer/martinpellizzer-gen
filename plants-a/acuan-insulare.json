It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure includes a short stem with hairy surfaces and small, oval-shaped leaves. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
