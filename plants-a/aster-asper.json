    "intro": "Aster asper, commonly known as the rough aster, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Aster asper is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
