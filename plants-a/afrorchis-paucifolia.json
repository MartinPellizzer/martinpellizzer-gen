    "intro": "Afrorchis paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and minimal foliage. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, often with a slight pinkish tinge. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
