    "intro": "Aristida depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf dropseed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive flat or slightly folded appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Aristida depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
