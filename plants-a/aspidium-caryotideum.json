    "intro": "Aspidium caryotideum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Aspidium caryotideum is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent."
