It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
