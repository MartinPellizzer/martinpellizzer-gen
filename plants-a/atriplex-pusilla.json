    "intro": "Atriplex pusilla, commonly known as saltbush or dwarf saltbush, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is highly adapted to saline soils, making it a common component of coastal and desert landscapes. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind. Atriplex pusilla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
