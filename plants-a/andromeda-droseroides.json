    "intro": "Andromeda droseroides, commonly known as the sticky leaves andromeda, is a rare and unusual plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and exhibits both woody and herbaceous characteristics, with a unique appearance that combines features of both shrubs and carnivorous plants. The plant produces sticky secretions on its leaves, which it uses to trap small insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
