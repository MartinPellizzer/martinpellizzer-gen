    "intro": "Andrachne decaisnei, commonly known as the Cape York sandplain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the sandplain ecosystems of northern Australia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
