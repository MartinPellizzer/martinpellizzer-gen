    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. dilaceratum, commonly known as the Norway maple variegated form, is a cultivar of the Norway maple. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white and green mottling on the leaves. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The variegation in this cultivar is due to genetic factors that affect chlorophyll distribution in the leaves.",
