    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burrplant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. Its leaves are alternate, with a serrated margin and a dark green, glossy appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subincisa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the western and southern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, often on scree slopes and among boulders. It is part of the bramble family and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within New Zealand, reflecting its ecological niche.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subincisa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and flowering display. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in some regions."
