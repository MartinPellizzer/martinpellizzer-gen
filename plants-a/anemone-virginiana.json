    "intro": "Anemone virginiana, commonly known as the Eastern wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, saucer-shaped bloom that appears in early spring. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture. Its flowers are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter and bloom before the leaves fully emerge. Anemone virginiana thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other early spring ephemerals."
