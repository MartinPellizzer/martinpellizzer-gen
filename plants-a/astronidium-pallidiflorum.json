    "intro": "Astronidium pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered Astronidium, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial shrub, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
