    "intro": "Anartia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-spotted swallowtail butterfly, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Papilionidae. It is characterized by its striking yellow and black wing patterns, with distinctive orange-yellow spots on the hind wings. The larvae of this species feed on plants in the Rutaceae family, such as citrus trees, which are their primary host plants. The adult butterflies are often found near these plants, where they lay their eggs. Anartia flavescens plays a role in pollination and serves as an indicator species for the health of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
