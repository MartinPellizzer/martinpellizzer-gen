    "intro": "Astracantha phrygia, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
