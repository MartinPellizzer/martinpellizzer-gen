    "intro": "Amaryllis andicola, commonly known as the Andean amaryllis, is a bulbous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting purple or red stripe. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the blooms, which typically appear in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and emerge from the base of the bulb. Amaryllis andicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
