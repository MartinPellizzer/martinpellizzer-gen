    "intro": "Atheropogon curtipendulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-like structures. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
