    "intro": "Angraecum amaniense, commonly known as the Amani orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Angraecum amaniense is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
