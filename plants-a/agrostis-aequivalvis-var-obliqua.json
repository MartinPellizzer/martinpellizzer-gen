    "intro": "Agrostis aequivalvis var. obliqua, commonly known as the slant-awn fescue, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awns that curve at an angle, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
