    "intro": "Aechmea stelligera, commonly known as the star pineapple, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, spathaceous bracts that enclose the inflorescence, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, strap-like, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Aechmea stelligera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
