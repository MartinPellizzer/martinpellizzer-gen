    "intro": "Arenaria modesta subsp. africana, commonly known as the African sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate periods of drought. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
