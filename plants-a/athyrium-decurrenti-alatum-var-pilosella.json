    "intro": "Athyrium decurrenti-alatum var. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy lady fern, is a variant of the decurrenti-alatum fern species. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
