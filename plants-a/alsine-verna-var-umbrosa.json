    "intro": "Alsine verna var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving alsike. This variant of Alsine verna is adapted to grow in low-light conditions, often found in forest understories or shaded garden beds. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to shady landscapes where other plants may struggle to thrive."
