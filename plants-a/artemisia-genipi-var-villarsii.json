It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its essential oils, rich in thujone and other compounds, have been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
