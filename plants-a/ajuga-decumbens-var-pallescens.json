    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. pallescens, commonly known as silver ajuga, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
