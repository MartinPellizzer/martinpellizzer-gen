    "intro": "Astragalus arctus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus arctus is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
