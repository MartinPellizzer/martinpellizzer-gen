    "intro": "Agalinis maritima, commonly known as sea bluestem, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a clump-forming growth habit. Agalinis maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
