    "intro": "Absinthium lanatum, commonly known as woolly wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic properties are attributed to compounds such as thujone and other essential oils. Absinthium lanatum is often found in dry, sunny habitats like meadows and rocky slopes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium lanatum is primarily native to Europe and western Asia. It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and parts of Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It is often associated with areas that have a temperate climate with mild winters and warm summers. Its distribution includes countries like France, Spain, Italy, and Greece.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium lanatum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and unique appearance. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered invasive in several regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern. Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent further spread."
