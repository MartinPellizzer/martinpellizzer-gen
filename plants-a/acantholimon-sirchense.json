    "intro": "Acantholimon sirchense, commonly known as the Sirchen's thornweed, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its survival. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon sirchense was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly soils, often along slopes or in disturbed sites. This plant thrives in regions with low to moderate rainfall and can tolerate drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought resistance and ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
