    "intro": "Ageratum fastigiatum, commonly known as the spiked ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is hairy and grayish-green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Ageratum fastigiatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
