    "intro": "Avena micrantha, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Avena micrantha is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
