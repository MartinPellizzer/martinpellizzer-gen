    "intro": "Aristida tunetana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate Tunisian grass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
