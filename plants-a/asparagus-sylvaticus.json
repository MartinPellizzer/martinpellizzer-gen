It is a perennial herb that typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces small, white or green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries. Its feathery foliage and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Asparagus sylvaticus is also valued for its edible young shoots, which are often consumed as a vegetable."
