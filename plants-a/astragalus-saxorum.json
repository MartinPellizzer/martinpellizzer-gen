    "intro": "Astragalus saxorum, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring high altitudes and cold climates. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Astragalus saxorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
