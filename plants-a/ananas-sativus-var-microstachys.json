    "intro": "Ananas sativus var. microstachys, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and produces a fruit that is smaller and less acidic than the common pineapple. The plant features rosettes of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by insects. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature size and exhibits a change in color."
