    "intro": "Arabis turrita var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
