    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha paxiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich soil. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest edges, and agricultural fields. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha paxiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Marshall Islands. It was likely introduced through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in these areas, often growing in disturbed soils and coastal environments. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems. Despite its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is also valued for its ecological and ornamental benefits."
