It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
