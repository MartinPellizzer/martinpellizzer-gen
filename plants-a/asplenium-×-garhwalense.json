    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 garhwalense, commonly known as the Garhwal spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium \u00d7 garhwalense exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits from its parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
