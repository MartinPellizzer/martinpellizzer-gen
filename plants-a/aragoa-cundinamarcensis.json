    "intro": "Aragoa cundinamarcensis, commonly known as the Cundinamarca aragoa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Aragoa cundinamarcensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
