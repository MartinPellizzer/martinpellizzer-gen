    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. heterotricha, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or k\u014dwhai, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and historical use by M\u0101ori for food and traditional medicine.",

This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly found in the lower South Island and parts of the North Island. The plant is adapted to a range of soil types and is often associated with native vegetation communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. heterotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in forested areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecological balance."
