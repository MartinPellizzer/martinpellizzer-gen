    "intro": "Astragalus breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
