    "intro": "Aquilaria crassna, commonly known as the white sand aquilaria, is a species of tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
