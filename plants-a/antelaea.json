    "intro": "Antelaea, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in regions such as South Africa and Madagascar. The plants are characterized by their showy yellow or orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a daisy-like pattern. Antelaea species often grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
