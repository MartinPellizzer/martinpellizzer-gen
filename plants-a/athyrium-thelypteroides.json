    "intro": "Athyrium thelypteroides, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a pale, fuzzy underside. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The reproductive structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
