    "intro": "Alsophila pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil, making it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in horticulture."
