    "intro": "Aloe occidentalis, commonly known as the Western aloe, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white tubercles along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow or orange flowers, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing and moisturizing properties. Aloe occidentalis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
