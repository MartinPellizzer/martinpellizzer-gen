    "intro": "Athyrium marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar. This fern belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive dark green coloration. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. The plant's unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
