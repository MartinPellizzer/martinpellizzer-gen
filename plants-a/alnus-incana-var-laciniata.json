    "intro": "Alnus incana var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lanceolate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
