    "intro": "Adiantum nervosum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting pollinators. Adiantum nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
