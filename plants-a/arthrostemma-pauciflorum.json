It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
