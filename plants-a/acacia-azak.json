    "intro": "Acacia azak, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and its distinctive, flat, pale green phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The wood of Acacia azak is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous communities for various purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia azak is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it adapts well to high salinity and limited water availability. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various desert species. Due to its hardy nature, it is also found in some parts of the Horn of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia azak was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open grasslands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
