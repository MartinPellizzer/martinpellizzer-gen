    "intro": "Amblynotopsis parryi, commonly known as the Parry's amblynotopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
