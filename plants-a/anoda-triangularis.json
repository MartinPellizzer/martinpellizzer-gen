    "intro": "Anoda triangularis, commonly known as the triangular morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, triangular-shaped capsule, which contributes to its common name. Anoda triangularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
