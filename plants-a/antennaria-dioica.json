    "intro": "Antennaria dioica, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Antennaria dioica is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats."
