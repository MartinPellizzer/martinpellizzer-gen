    "intro": "Abies kansouensis, commonly known as the Japanese white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the genus Abies in the family Pinaceae, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its foliage is dense and dark green, often retaining its color throughout the winter. The cones are small and cylindrical, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies kansouensis is primarily native to Japan, specifically the islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. It is typically found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. It is commonly associated with areas of high biodiversity and is a characteristic component of the temperate forest ecosystems in these regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies kansouensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils, often growing in forests or as an understory plant. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping and reforestation purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with specific environmental conditions that mimic its native habitat."
