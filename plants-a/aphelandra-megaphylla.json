    "intro": "Aphelandra megaphylla, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Aphelandra megaphylla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
