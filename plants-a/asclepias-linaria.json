It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and it serves as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Asclepias linaria is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes."
