    "intro": "Acaciella submontana, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it a hardy species suited to rocky soils. Acaciella submontana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella submontana is primarily native to the highland regions of southern Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guerrero. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in limestone soils and on rocky slopes. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and moist mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella submontana was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, typically found in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed sites. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and extensive root system. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Australia and the United States. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
