It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and fragrant properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
