It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.
