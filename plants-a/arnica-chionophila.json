    "intro": "Arnica chionophila, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and are composed of numerous ray florets. Arnica chionophila is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less commonly used than other arnica species."
