    "intro": "Aequatorium stellatopilosum, commonly known as the starry-hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. The species is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for aquatic life."
