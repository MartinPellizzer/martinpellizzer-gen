    "intro": "Acrostichum variabile var. laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a variant of the variable fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
