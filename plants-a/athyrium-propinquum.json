    "intro": "Athyrium propinquum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to eastern North America. It features a tall, slender rhizome with bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and resemble feathers. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
