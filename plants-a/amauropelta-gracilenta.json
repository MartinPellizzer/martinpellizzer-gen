It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the substrate. The leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive fringed appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
