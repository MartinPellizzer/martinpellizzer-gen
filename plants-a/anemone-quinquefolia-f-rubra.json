    "intro": "Anemone quinquefolia f. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered wood anemone, is a striking perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces showy clusters of five-petaled, pink to red flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and hairy stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
