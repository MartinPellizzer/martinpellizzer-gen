    "intro": "Andicolea cinerea, commonly known as the gray mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green leaves and small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Andicolea cinerea is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
