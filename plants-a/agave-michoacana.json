    "intro": "Agave michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan agave, is a perennial plant native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in small, white tubercles. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Mexican crafts."
