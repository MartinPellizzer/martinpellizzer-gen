    "intro": "Aconitum lamarckii f. palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a variant of the European aconite with distinctive palmate leaf patterns. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Japan, characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant features compound leaves with deeply lobed foliage, resembling a palm, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
