    "intro": "Aristolochia meridionaliana subsp. popondettensis, commonly known as the Southern Pipevine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant is climbing and can reach lengths of several meters, using its tendrils to support itself on structures or trees. Its flowers produce a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators, such as flies. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it an important species in discussions of medicinal and ecological toxicity."
