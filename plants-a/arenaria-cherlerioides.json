    "intro": "Arenaria cherlerioides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Arenaria cherlerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
