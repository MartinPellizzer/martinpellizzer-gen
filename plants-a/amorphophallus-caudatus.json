    "intro": "Amorphophallus caudatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's most notable characteristic is its massive, spadix-shaped inflorescence, which can reach heights of over 3 meters. It produces fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshy or swampy areas."
