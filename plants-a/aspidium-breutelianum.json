It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Aspidium breutelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
