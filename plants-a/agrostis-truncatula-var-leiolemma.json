    "intro": "Agrostis truncatula var. leiolemma, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shaded, wet environments and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
