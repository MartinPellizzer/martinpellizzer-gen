    "intro": "Atriplex vesicaria subsp. appendiculata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, and it typically grows in sandy or coastal soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often borne on erect, branched stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in regions with high salinity, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes."
