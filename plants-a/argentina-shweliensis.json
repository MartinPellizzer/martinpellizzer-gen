    "intro": "Argentina shweliensis, commonly known as the Argentine shweliensis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Argentina. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
