    "intro": "Aloe attenuata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on branched inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
