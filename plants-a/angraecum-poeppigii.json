    "intro": "Angraecum poeppigii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a prominent central lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, which are attracted to its nectar-rich structure. Angraecum poeppigii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
