    "intro": "Amomum polycarpum, commonly known as cardamom, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped rhizomes. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that develop into three-lobed, reddish-brown berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a distinctive scent, while its rhizomes are the primary part used in culinary and medicinal applications. Amomum polycarpum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its valuable essential oils and flavoring properties."
