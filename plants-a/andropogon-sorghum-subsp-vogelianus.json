    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subsp. vogelianus, commonly known as Vogel's sorghum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Vogel's sorghum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
