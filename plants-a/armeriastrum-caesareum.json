    "intro": "Armeriastrum caesareum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Armeriastrum caesareum is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
