    "intro": "Agropyron secundum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Agropyron secundum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
