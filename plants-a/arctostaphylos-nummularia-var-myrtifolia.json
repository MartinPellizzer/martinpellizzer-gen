It features broad, elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive red or purple underside. The plant produces showy clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
