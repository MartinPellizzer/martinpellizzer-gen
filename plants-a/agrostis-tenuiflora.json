    "intro": "Agrostis tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on lawns, golf courses, and moist soils, often thriving in shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in turfgrass systems. Due to its adaptability and resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
