It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a hairy stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.",
