It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early to mid-summer.
