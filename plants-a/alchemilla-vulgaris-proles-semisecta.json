    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles semisecta, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often semi-split, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in woodland settings."
