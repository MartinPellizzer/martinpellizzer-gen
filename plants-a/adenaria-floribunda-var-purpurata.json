    "intro": "Adenaria floribunda var. purpurata, commonly known as the purple-flowered adenaria, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, fleshy tubers underground, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Adenaria floribunda var. purpurata thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
