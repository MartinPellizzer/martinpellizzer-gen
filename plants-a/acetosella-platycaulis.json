    "intro": "Acetosella platycaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically red-tinged or purple, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and shady borders.",
