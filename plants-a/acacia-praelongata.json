    "intro": "Acacia praelongata, commonly known as the longpod acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia praelongata is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia praelongata is primarily native to the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia praelongata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils, making it a common invader in agricultural and urban environments. The plant spreads primarily through its long, serotinous pods that release seeds after fire or mechanical disturbance. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in multiple regions beyond its native range. Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed in areas where it competes with native vegetation."
