The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical umbels of white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to botanical collections and gardens."
