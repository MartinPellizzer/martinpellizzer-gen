    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. campylopodum, commonly known as the sticky seed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is characterized by its yellow or orange, sticky seeds that adhere to the fur or feathers of animals, facilitating its dispersal. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a hemiparasitic relationship. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing a single ovary that develops into a fleshy, sticky seed capsule. Due to its specialized life cycle and reliance on hosts, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
