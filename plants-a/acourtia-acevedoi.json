    "intro": "Acourtia acevedoi, commonly known as the Acevedo's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. Acourtia acevedoi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
