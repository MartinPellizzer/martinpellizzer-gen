    "intro": "Agrostemma githago var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-flowered corn poppy, is a variant of the corn poppy species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in fields. Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet lesser-known relative of the common corn poppy."
