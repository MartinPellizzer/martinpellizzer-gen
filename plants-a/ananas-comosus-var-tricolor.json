    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. tricolor, commonly known as the rainbow pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a variant of the pineapple that features three distinct color bands on its fruit\u2014typically red, yellow, and green\u2014creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces a spiky, leafy crown at the top of the fruit, which is characteristic of the pineapple family. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The fruit develops from the central core of the plant and is harvested when the leaves begin to yellow and the fruit reaches full size."
