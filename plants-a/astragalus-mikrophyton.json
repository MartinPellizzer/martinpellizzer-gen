    "intro": "Astragalus mikrophyton, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain minute seeds, typical of many Astragalus species. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils with limited water availability. Due to its ecological significance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
