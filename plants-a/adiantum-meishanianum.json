    "intro": "Adiantum meishanianum, commonly known as the Meishan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly notched, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Adiantum meishanianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
