    "intro": "Anemone nigricans, commonly known as the black anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. Its root system consists of fibrous rhizomes that help it survive in moist, woodland habitats. Anemone nigricans is often found in shaded areas along stream banks and in rich, loamy soils."
