    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus dolichospermaticus, commonly known as the long-seed headtorch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its spines are relatively short and often cover the entire stem, providing protection from herbivores. The fruit is a small, elongated pod that contains numerous seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
