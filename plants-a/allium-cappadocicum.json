    "intro": "Allium cappadocicum, commonly known as Cappadocian garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, clustered bulbs and long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in umbels, which are typically followed by small, rounded berries. Its bulbs are used in culinary applications, similar to regular garlic, but are less pungent and have a milder flavor. Allium cappadocicum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
