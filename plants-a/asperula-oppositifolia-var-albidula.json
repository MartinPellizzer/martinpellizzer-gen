    "intro": "Asperula oppositifolia var. albidula, commonly known as the white-flowered evergreen shrub, is a variant of the common asperula, characterized by its pale white to almost cream-colored flowers. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom throughout the spring and early summer."
