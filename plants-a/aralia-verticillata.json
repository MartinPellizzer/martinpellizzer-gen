    "intro": "Aralia verticillata, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets arranged in a whorl at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can spread horizontally, making it a persistent weed in forested areas. The plant is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
