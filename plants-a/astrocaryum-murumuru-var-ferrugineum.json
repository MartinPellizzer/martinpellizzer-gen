    "intro": "Astrocaryum murumuru var. ferrugineum, commonly known as murumuru butter tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, feather-like fronds. The tree produces large, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, followed by elongated, woody fruits. The seeds are encased in a thick, oily pulp, which is the source of the highly valued murumuru butter used in cosmetics and skincare products. This species plays a crucial role in the ecological and economic systems of the Amazon region."
