    "intro": "Alloplectus deltoideus, commonly known as the delta pleated fern, is a unique member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it a fan-like appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Alloplectus deltoideus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
