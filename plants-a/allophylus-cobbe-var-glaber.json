    "intro": "Allophylus cobbe var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leaved allophylus, is a variant of the Allophylus cobbe species native to certain regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
