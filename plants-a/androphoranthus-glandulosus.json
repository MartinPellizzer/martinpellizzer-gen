    "intro": "Androphoranthus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in ecological and horticultural research."
