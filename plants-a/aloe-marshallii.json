    "intro": "Aloe marshallii, commonly known as Marshall's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers on tall, branched stalks during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aloe marshallii is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used for topical applications compared to other aloe species."
