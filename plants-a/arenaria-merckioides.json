    "intro": "Arenaria merckioides, commonly known as the sandstone arenaria, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy habitats of southern Africa. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
