    "intro": "Aspidium scabrosum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium scabrosum is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural habitats."
