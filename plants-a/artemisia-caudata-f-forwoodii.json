It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and narrow, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
