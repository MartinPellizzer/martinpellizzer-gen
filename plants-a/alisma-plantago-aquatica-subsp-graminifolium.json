    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically floating or submersed, adapted to its aquatic environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in waterlogged habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity and water filtration."
