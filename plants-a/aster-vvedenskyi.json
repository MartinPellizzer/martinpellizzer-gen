    "intro": "Aster vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's aster, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Aster vvedenskyi plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environments."
