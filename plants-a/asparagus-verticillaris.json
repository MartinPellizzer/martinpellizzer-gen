    "intro": "Asparagus verticillaris, commonly known as the whorled asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, zigzagging stems that produce small, white flowers in clusters at the leaf axils. The plant has feather-like, trifoliate leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils. Asparagus verticillaris is often grown as an ornamental plant for its delicate foliage and unique growth habit."
