It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that anchor it to rocky or gravelly soils. Anemone montana thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
