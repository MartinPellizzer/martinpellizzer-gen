    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chordantha is primarily native to Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of forests. It is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its native distribution is limited to these specific Central American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chordantha was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through accidental transport via shipping or gardening activities. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of native habitats."
