    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
