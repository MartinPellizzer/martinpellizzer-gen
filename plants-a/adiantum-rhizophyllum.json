    "intro": "Adiantum rhizophyllum, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Adiantaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, allowing it to spread along the ground. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions.",
