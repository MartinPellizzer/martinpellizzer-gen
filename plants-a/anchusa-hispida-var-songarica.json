    "intro": "Anchusa hispida var. songarica, commonly known as the Songarica thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features a tall, upright stem covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, prickly hairs, contributing to its robust and somewhat prickly texture. Anchusa hispida var. songarica is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments."
