    "intro": "Armeria girardii, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Armeria girardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
