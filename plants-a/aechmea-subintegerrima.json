    "intro": "Aechmea subintegerrima, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of pink, red, or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Aechmea subintegerrima is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
