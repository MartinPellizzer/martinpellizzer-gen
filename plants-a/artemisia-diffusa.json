    "intro": "Artemisia diffusa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
