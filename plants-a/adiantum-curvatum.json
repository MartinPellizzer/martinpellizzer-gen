    "intro": "Adiantum curvatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly curved. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Adiantum curvatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
