    "intro": "Asplenium dimidiatum var. zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its fronds are usually dimidiate, meaning they are divided into two unequal parts, with the lower portion often bearing sporangia. This variant is notable for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
