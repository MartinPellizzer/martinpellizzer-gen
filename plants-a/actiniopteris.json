    "intro": "Actiniopteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily. They thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Actiniopteris species are known for their ability to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to water purification. Their reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, releasing spores for propagation."
