    "intro": "Aulomyrcia laruotteana var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian alpine orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
