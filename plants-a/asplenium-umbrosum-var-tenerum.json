    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. tenerum, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a unique, almost moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and produce small, shield-shaped leaves that are tightly clustered. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
