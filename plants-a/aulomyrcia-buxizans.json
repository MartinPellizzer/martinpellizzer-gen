    "intro": "Aulomyrcia buxizans, commonly known as the glossy boxwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically a deep green with a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or topiary in landscaping. Aulomyrcia buxizans is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens."
