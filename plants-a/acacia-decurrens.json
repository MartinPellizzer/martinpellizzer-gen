    "intro": "Acacia decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices. Acacia decurrens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and along roadsides. Acacia decurrens plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens was mainly introduced to a wide range of regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, including Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, among others. It has been established in various ecological zones, from the humid climates of Assam and the East Himalaya to the drier regions of California and Queensland. The plant's adaptability has allowed it to thrive in diverse environments, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, such as the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, as well as in the southern islands of New Zealand and Tasmania. Its introduction to these areas has been largely due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological and agricultural use."
