    "intro": "Agrostis wightii, commonly known as Wight's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. Agrostis wightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
