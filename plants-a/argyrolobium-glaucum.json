    "intro": "Argyrolobium glaucum, commonly known as the silver globular pea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its globular, silver-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
