    "intro": "Aulosepalum nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's aulosepalum, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aulosepalum nelsonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
