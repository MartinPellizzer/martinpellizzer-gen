    "intro": "Agrostis varia, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its variability in leaf and inflorescence morphology, which contributes to its common name."
