    "intro": "Aloe linita, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to the plant. Aloe linita is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
