    "intro": "Armeria rigida proles bupleuroides, commonly known as the rigid thrift or bupleurum-like thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. Its stems are upright and often branching, forming a compact, mat-like growth. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
