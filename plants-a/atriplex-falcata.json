    "intro": "Atriplex falcata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. Atriplex falcata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
