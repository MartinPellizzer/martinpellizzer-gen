    "intro": "Auricula-ursi wulfeniana subsp. baumgarteniana, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges. It features a low-growing rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure, which gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
