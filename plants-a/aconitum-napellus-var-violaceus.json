    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. violaceus, commonly known as the violet aconite, is a variant of the European monkshood plant. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
