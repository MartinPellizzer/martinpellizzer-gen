    "intro": "Ajuga bracteosa var. densiflora, commonly known as silver carpet or denseflower bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that form a dense mat, making it an effective ground cover. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming extensive colonies."
