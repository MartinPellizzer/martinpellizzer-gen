    "intro": "Arnoldia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for urban landscapes and reforestation efforts."
