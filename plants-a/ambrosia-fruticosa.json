    "intro": "Ambrosia fruticosa, commonly known as ragweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its role as a significant allergen. Its leaves are finely divided, with a rough texture, and it has a distinctive, hollow stem. Ambrosia fruticosa is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas, where it can form dense stands."
