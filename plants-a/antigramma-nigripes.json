    "intro": "Antigramma nigripes, commonly known as black-veined antigramma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Antigramma nigripes is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
