These plants are native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Aciphylla species are characterized by their dense, woolly foliage that gives them a silvery appearance. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Many species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
