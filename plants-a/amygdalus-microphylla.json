    "intro": "Amygdalus microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf almond or desert almond, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces fragrant white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, edible almonds that are often used in traditional medicine. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for drought-prone environments."
