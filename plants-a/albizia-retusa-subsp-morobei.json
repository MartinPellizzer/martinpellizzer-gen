    "intro": "Albizia retusa subsp. morobei, commonly known as the Morobe albizia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, cream-colored flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The wood of this species is often used locally for construction and crafts due to its durability and workability."
