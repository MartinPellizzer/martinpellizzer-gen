    "intro": "Apocynum lanceolatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This species plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is a member of the Apocynaceae family."
