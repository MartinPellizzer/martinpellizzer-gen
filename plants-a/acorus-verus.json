    "intro": "Acorus verus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellowish underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spadices, typical of the Aroid family. Acorus verus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits in aquatic environments.",
