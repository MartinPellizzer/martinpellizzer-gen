    "intro": "Agrostis turiensis, commonly known as the Turi grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering units. Agrostis turiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
