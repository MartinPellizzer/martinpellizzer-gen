    "intro": "Atelophragma harringtonii, commonly known as the Harrington's starling tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
