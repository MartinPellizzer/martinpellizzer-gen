    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon propinquum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the northeastern regions of the country, including the states of Par\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, and Piau\u00ed. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is commonly associated with riverbanks and lowland forests, where it benefits from high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon propinquum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
