    "intro": "Arrhenatherum sempervirens, commonly known as common wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ornamental horticulture."
