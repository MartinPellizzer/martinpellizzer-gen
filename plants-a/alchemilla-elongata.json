    "intro": "Alchemilla elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla elongata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
