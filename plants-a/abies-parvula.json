    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies parvula is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is found in regions such as California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as in British Columbia. This species thrives in high elevation areas, often in coniferous forests. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous terrain. Abies parvula is also known as the dwarf mountain pine due to its small size and dense growth habit.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies parvula was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range due to horticultural interest and climate change. It is often found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in regions where it is cultivated. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
