    "intro": "Amygdalus fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered almond or desert almond, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems arising from the base, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hard pods containing edible seeds, which are similar in structure to true almonds but are not typically consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a leathery texture adapted to withstand drought conditions. Amygdalus fasciculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
