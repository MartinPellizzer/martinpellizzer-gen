    "intro": "Anemonoides baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain anemone, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, open habitats at higher elevations. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Anemonoides baldensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
