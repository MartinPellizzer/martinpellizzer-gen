    "intro": "Actinomeris squarrosa var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It features a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy white flower with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems.",
