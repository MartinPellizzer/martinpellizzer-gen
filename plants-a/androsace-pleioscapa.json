    "intro": "Androsace pleioscapa, commonly known as the broad-leaved androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming foliage composed of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Androsace pleioscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
