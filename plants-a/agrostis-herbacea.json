    "intro": "Agrostis herbacea, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
