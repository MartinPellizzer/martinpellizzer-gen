    "intro": "Astragalus pycnostachyus var. pycnostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Astragalus pycnostachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
