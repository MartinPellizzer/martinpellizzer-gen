    "intro": "Asplenium pseudoauriculatum, commonly known as the false ear spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette-like formation. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium pseudoauriculatum is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
