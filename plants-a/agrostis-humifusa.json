    "intro": "Agrostis humifusa, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts that spread along the ground, often in moist or shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
