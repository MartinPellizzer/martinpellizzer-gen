    "intro": "Anettea imperatoris-maximiliani, commonly known as the imperial anettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
