    "intro": "Acarpha agglomerata, commonly known as the clustered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarpha agglomerata is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. It is often seen in grasslands and along the edges of deserts. Acarpha agglomerata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarpha agglomerata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lands. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in the eastern and central United States, particularly in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it an invasive species in many local ecosystems. It is often considered a weed due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native vegetation."
