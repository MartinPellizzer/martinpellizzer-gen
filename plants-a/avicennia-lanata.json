    "intro": "Avicennia lanata, commonly known as the gray mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant has a complex root system with pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that extend above the soil to facilitate gas exchange. Avicennia lanata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
