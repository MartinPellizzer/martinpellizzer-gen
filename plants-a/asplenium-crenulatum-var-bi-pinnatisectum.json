    "intro": "Asplenium crenulatum var. bi-pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The leaves are bi-pinnatisectum, meaning they are twice divided into narrow segments, giving the plant a lacy appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
