    "intro": "Astragalus domitus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Astragalus domitus is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
