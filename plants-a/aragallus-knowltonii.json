    "intro": "Aragallus knowltonii, commonly known as the Knowlton's aragallus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
