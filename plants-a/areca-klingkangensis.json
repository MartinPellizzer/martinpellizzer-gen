    "intro": "Areca klingkangensis, commonly known as the Borneo areca, is a palm species native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, making it suitable for propagation through seed dispersal."
