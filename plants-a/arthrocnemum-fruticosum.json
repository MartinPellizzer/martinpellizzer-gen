    "intro": "Arthrocnemum fruticosum, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. Its adaptations make it a resilient species in desert and semi-arid regions."
