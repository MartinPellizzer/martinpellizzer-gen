    "intro": "Ascogrammitis stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's chain fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds. Ascogrammitis stuebelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
