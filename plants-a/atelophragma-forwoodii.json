    "intro": "Atelophragma forwoodii, commonly known as the Forwood's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
