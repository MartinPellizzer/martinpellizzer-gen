    "intro": "Atriplex pedunculata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots can exude salts, helping to detoxify the soil and making it useful for reclaiming saline land. Atriplex pedunculata is also valued for its nutritional content and is used in some traditional foods and livestock feed."
