    "intro": "Adenostephanus austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
