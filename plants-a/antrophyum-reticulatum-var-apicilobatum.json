    "intro": "Antrophyum reticulatum var. apicilobatum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, cascading fronds that form a compact, bushy structure, often resembling a small tree or shrub. The fronds are typically bright green with a metallic sheen, and they bear small, clustered spore-producing structures called sorangia. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in shaded, humid environments. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor and terrarium cultivation."
