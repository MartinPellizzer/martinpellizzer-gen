    "intro": "Anchusa calcarea var. losadae, commonly known as the Losada's blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
