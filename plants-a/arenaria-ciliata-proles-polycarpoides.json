    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata proles polycarpoides, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves with dense cilia along the edges, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its proles polycarpoides variant refers to its branching structure, which enhances its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
