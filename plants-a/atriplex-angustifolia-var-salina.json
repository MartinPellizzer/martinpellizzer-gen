    "intro": "Atriplex angustifolia var. salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant has small, green to grayish-green leaves with a waxy coating to minimize water evaporation. It produces clusters of greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. This species is widely distributed in arid and coastal regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
