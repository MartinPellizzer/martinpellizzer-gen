    "intro": "Agrostis tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert habitats. Agrostis tibestica plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
