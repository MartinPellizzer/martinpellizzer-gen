    "intro": "Aquilegia japonica f. globularis, commonly known as the Japanese columbine. This variant is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flowers compared to the typical species. The plant features showy, spurred petals in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and vibrant, clustered blooms."
