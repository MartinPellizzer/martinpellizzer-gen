    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum var. fragile, commonly known as the fragile wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, white to pale brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
