    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mayana is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. It is also found in parts of Mexico, particularly in the southern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to moist forests and scrublands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in secondary growth areas. Acacia mayana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mayana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Central and South America, as well as parts of Africa and Asia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been introduced as a potential agroforestry species for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems."
