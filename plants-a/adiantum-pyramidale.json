    "intro": "Adiantum pyramidale, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to North America. It features lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are divided into small, tooth-like segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum pyramidale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.",
