    "intro": "Ajuga pseudochia, commonly known as False Spurge or Narrowleaf Bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple. Ajuga pseudochia is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to spread and cover ground effectively, though it can be invasive in some regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland or shaded areas."
