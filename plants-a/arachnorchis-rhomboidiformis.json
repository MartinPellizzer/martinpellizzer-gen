    "intro": "Arachnorchis rhomboidiformis, commonly known as the diamond-shaped spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, rhombus-shaped floral structure and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single or few flowers with a distinctive, spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It blooms during the late winter to early spring season, often in response to rainfall. The orchid has a short-lived, herbaceous growth habit and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
