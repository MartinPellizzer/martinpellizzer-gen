    "intro": "Aristolochia davilae, commonly known as the Mexican dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often twisted leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or brown in color, resembling a pipe or a pipestem. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. The plant is also notable for containing aristolochic acids, which have been linked to kidney toxicity in humans."
