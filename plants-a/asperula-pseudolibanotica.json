    "intro": "Asperula pseudolibanotica, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
