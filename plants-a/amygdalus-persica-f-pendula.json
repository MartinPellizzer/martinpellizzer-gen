    "intro": "Amygdalus persica f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully. It produces fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common peaches but often smaller and more delicate. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks. The weeping peach is also valued for its ornamental beauty and mild, sweet fruit."
