    "intro": "Angelica morrisonicola var. morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
