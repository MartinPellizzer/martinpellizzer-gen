It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its flowering period is usually during the warmer months, and it is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure. Adenochloa flacciflora is often found in lowland areas and is considered a minor component of many grassland ecosystems.",
