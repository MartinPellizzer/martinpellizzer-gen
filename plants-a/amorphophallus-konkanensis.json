    "intro": "Amorphophallus konkanensis, commonly known as the Konkan arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a tuberous root that is used as a starch source in local cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
