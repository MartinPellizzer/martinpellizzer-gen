    "intro": "Agrostis capensis, commonly known as Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, coastal dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
