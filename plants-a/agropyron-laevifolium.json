    "intro": "Agropyron laevifolium, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves that are smooth and slightly curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Agropyron laevifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
