    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense clumps of narrow, bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces spikelets with small, wind-dispersed seeds, adapted to thrive in saline and sandy environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate saltwater and extreme weather makes it a resilient coastal vegetation species."
