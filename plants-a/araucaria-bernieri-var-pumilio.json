    "intro": "Araucaria bernieri var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf araucaria, is a small evergreen conifer native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the coniferous family. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
