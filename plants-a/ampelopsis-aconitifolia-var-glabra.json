It features heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that transition to red berries in the fall. Its stems are typically hairy but become smooth in the varietal form. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
