    "intro": "Aspidium webbianum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and ponds. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. Its fronds are typically divided into small, serrated segments that help in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Aspidium webbianum is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
