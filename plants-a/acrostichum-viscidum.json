    "intro": "Acrostichum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or near streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Acrostichum viscidum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture.",
