It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple florets, which are typical of the genus Aristea. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
