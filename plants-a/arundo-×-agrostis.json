    "intro": "Arundo \u00d7 agrostis, commonly known as the hybrid reedgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arundo donax and Agrostis species. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like structure and is often found in wetland environments. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, which limits its natural spread. It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in phytoremediation projects."
