It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette shape, and are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Anemone oligantha is a hardy perennial that thrives in cooler climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows."
