    "intro": "Aristolochia elegans, commonly known as the elegant Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
