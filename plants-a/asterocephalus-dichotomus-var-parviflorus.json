    "intro": "Asterocephalus dichotomus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flower dichotomous aster, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a dichotomous pattern, meaning they split into two equal branches at each node. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
