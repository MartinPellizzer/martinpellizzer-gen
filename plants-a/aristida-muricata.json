    "intro": "Aristida muricata, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features slender, wiry stems with hairy leaves that are often glandular and emit a distinctive odor. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical arrangements. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Aristida muricata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides."
