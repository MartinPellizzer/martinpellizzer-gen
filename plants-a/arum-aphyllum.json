    "intro": "Arum aphyllum, commonly known as the naked arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glossy sheen. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it blooms during the warm season. Arum aphyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, shaded environments."
