    "intro": "Apium ranunculifolium, commonly known as wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are white with a single red or purple flower in the center, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
