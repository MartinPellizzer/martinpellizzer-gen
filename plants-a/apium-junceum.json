    "intro": "Apium junceum, commonly known as narrowleaf parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the carrot family. Apium junceum is often used as a culinary herb, similar to parsley, and has a mild, fresh flavor."
