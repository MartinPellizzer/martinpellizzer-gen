    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species characterized by its dense, turf-like growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color and have a slightly bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland environments or as a component of lawns and golf courses. This form is particularly valued for its fine texture and ability to form a dense, durable sod."
