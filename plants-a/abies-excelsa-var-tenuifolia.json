    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fir, is a variant of the silver fir native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly twisted arrangement. The plant produces cones that are usually pendulous and have a slender, cylindrical shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine or alpine regions. The botanical features of this variant make it well adapted to its harsh mountainous habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. tenuifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Myanmar, and Vietnam. It thrives in high-altitude forests where the climate is cool and moist. This variety of the firs is commonly found in temperate to subtropical zones at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed coniferous forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and found in limited geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. tenuifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is valued for its slender, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, making it a desirable specimen plant. This variety is often cultivated in cooler climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils and partial shade. Although it is not widely naturalized, it has been occasionally reported in regions with suitable microclimates. Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of coniferous plants in specialized collections."
