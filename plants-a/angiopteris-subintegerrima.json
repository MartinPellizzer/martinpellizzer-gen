    "intro": "Angiopteris subintegerrima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
