    "intro": "Aspidium skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize wetlands and stream banks. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
