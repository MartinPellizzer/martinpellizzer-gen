    "intro": "Andropogon tetra-aristatus, commonly known as the four-awned grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with four awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of water quality."
