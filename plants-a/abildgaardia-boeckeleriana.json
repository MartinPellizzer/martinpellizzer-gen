    "intro": "Abildgaardia boeckeleriana, commonly known as the Boeckelerian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia boeckeleriana is primarily native to the highland regions of South America, specifically in the Andean mountain ranges of Ecuador and Peru. This species is found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in areas with cool temperatures and high humidity, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia boeckeleriana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it serves as a decorative plant. The species has been cultivated in regions with temperate climates, particularly in Europe and North America. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical exchanges. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown."
