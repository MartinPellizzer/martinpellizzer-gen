    "intro": "Acer laurinum subsp. decandrum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant colors of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant has opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal. This species is well-suited for cultivation in gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.",
