It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be dangerous to humans and animals.",
