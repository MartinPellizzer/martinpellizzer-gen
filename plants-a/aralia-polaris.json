    "intro": "Aralia polaris, commonly known as the polar aralia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, umbel-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short stem with compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. It grows close to the ground, often in rocky or sandy soils, and is a key component of the tundra's plant community. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
