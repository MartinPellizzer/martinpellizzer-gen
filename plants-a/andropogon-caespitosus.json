    "intro": "Andropogon caespitosus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil conditions and is highly drought-tolerant. It is also an important species in ecological restoration and biofuel production due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements."
