    "intro": "Alchemilla vellerea, commonly known as the velvet alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla vellerea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
