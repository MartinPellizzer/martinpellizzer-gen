    "intro": "Arthrostachya, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Arthrostachya species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with short, sturdy stems and dense clusters of small, often showy flowers. They typically thrive in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Arthrostachya capensis and Arthrostachya linearis, which are prized for their ornamental value and resilience."
