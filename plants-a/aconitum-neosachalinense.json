    "intro": "Aconitum neosachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in mountainous regions.",
