    "intro": "Allophyllum nemophilophyllum, commonly known as the forest alpine, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Allophyllum nemophilophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in garden settings that mimic its natural habitat."
