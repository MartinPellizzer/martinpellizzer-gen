    "intro": "Anaphalis transnokoensis, commonly known as the Transnoko silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, fluffy flower heads that resemble clouds, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
