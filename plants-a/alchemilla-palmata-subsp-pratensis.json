    "intro": "Alchemilla palmata subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive silver-white, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and damp grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation."
