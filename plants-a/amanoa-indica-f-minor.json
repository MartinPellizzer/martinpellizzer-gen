    "intro": "Amanoa indica f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf poinciana, is a compact shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features small, delicate leaves that are opposite and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, resembling the blooms of the standard poinciana. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
