    "intro": "Apluda humilis, commonly known as the dwarf apluda, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Apluda humilis is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
