    "intro": "Aspidium bolsteri, commonly known as the Bolster's water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features fronds that are divided into pinnate structures, with a distinctive rhomboidal shape. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium bolsteri is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
