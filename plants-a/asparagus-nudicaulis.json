    "intro": "Asparagus nudicaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
