    "intro": "Alternanthera dendrotricha, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow foliage that changes with the seasons. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by small, three-lobed fruits."
