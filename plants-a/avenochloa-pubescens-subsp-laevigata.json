    "intro": "Avenochloa pubescens subsp. laevigata, commonly known as smooth-haired avenochloa, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
