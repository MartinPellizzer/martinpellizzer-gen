    "intro": "Aster veitchianus, commonly known as the Veitch's aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
