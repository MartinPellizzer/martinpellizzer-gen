    "intro": "Aporum hagerupii, commonly known as the Hagerup's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Its fronds are typically bright green and provide a striking visual presence in the undergrowth. Aporum hagerupii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
