    "intro": "Andinia pilosella, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Andinia pilosella plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
