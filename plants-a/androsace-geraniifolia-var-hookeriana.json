    "intro": "Androsace geraniifolia var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's fairy bell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
