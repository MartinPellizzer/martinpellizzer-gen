    "intro": "Aster vittatus, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers from late summer into early fall. Aster vittatus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivorous insects."
