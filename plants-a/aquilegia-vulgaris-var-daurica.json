It features striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, arranged in a distinctive helmet-like pattern. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate divisions, and its flowers typically bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
