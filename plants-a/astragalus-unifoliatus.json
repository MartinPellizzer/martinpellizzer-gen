    "intro": "Astragalus unifoliatus, commonly known as the single-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and a single, broad leaf. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, hot environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
