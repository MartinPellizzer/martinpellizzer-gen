    "intro": "Asplenium sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium sarasinorum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
