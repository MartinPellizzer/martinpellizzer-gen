    "intro": "Alchemilla rugulosa, commonly known as the wooly alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features dense, soft, grayish-white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Alchemilla rugulosa produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
