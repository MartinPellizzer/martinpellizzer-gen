    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rufivellum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with desert and semi-arid environments. Its native range includes areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rufivellum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive velvety leaves and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the United States and Australia. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
