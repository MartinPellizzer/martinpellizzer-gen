    "intro": "Angelica shikokiana subsp. yakusimensis, commonly known as Yakushima angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to the islands of Yakushima and Kikai in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a terminal umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
