It features a distinctive spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and can vary in size depending on the habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
