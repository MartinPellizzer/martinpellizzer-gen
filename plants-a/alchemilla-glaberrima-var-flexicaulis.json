    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the slender alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
