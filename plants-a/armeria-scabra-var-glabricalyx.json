    "intro": "Armeria scabra var. glabricalyx, commonly known as the glabrous-leaved thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features compact, succulent-like foliage that is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Armeria scabra."
