    "intro": "Argythamnia schiedeana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser argythamnia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in low-water conditions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
