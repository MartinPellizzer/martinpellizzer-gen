    "intro": "Axonopus ciliatifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaf axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with fine, hairy margins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its dense growth habit makes it a useful plant for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
