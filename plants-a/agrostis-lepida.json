    "intro": "Agrostis lepida, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
