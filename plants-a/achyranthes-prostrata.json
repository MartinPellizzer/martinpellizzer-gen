    "intro": "Achyranthes prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate alyssum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture with a bluish-green hue. Achyranthes prostrata is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.",
