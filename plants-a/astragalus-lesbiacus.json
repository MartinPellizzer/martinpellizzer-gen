    "intro": "Astragalus lesbiacus, commonly known as the Lesbia milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
