It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
