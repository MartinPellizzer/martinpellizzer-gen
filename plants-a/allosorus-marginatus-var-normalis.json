    "intro": "Allosorus marginatus var. normalis, commonly known as the common alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
