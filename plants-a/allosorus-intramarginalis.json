    "intro": "Allosorus intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal allosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other wood ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique marginal pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
