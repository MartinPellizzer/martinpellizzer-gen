This variety is typically found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It grows in elevations ranging from approximately 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. The plant thrives in forested areas, often forming part of mixed coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary environmental conditions for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "[WRONG START] Abies homolephis var. scottae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, humid climates. This variety is often planted for its ornamental value, including its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. It has been used in both residential and commercial landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in native habitats."
