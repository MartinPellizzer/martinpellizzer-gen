    "intro": "Aspidium amplissimum var. macrum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
