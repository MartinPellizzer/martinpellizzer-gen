    "intro": "Arum diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf arum, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive purple spathe that encloses a spadix, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. The plant produces showy, arrow-shaped leaves that vary in size and texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as both an ecological indicator species and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
