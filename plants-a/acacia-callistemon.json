    "intro": "Acacia callistemon, commonly known as the red bottlebrush, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or crimson flower spikes, which are actually clusters of tiny, tubular flowers. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Acacia callistemon is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which improves soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia callistemon is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including heathlands, woodlands, and open forests. It is particularly adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of these regions. Its distribution is closely associated with the natural vegetation patterns of southeastern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia callistemon was mainly introduced to Australia, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is known for its bright red flowers and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is established."
