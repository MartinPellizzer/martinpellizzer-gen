    "intro": "Anacamptis champagneuxii f. albina, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the Champagne orchid. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale to white petals and sepals, which contrast with its green foliage. This orchid is native to southern Europe, particularly France and Italy, where it grows in moist, calcareous soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
