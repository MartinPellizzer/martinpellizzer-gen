    "intro": "Arisaema gracile, commonly known as the slender cobra lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces striking, hooded spathes that resemble a cobra's head. The plant's inflorescence consists of a single, showy spathe enclosing a spadix with numerous small, greenish-white flowers. Arisaema gracile thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade gardens."
