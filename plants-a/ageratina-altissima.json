It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Ageratina altissima is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
