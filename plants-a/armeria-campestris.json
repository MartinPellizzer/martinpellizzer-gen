It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Armeria campestris is also an important plant for coastal dune stabilization."
