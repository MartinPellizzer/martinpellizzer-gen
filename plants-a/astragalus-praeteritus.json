    "intro": "Astragalus praeteritus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
