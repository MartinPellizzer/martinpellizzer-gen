    "intro": "Astragalus glabrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Astragalus glabrifolius is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potential pharmacological significance."
