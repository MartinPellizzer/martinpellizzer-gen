    "intro": "Allium hissaricum, commonly known as the Caucasian leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, spherical, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valued crop in some regions. Allium hissaricum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments."
