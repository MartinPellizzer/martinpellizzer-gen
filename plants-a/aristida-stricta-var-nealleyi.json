    "intro": "Aristida stricta var. nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly flowering heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
