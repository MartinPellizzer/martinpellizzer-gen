It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.

Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
