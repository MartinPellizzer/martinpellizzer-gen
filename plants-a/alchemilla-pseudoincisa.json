    "intro": "Alchemilla pseudoincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla pseudoincisa prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges and meadows."
