It features small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in alpine or coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
