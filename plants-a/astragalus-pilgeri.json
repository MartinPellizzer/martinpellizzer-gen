    "intro": "Astragalus pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
