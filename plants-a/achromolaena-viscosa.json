    "intro": "Achromolaena viscosa, commonly known as the rough hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Achromolaena viscosa is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.",
