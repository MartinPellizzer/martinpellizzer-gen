    "intro": "Allium aeginiense, commonly known as the Aegean garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the Aegean region of Turkey. It is a perennial herb characterized by its bulbous structure and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
