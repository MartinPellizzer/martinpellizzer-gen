    "intro": "Aeschynanthus nummularius, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, waxy, silver-white leaves that give it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming from spring to summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus nummularius is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and long-lasting blooms."
