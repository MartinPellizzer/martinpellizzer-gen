    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachya, commonly known as slender-stemmed wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
