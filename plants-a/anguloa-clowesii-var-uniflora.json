It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a single, large bloom per stem. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
