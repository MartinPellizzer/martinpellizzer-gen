    "intro": "Astracantha leioclados, commonly known as the smooth-horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
