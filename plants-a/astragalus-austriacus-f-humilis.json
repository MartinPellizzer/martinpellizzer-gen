    "intro": "Astragalus austriacus f. humilis, commonly known as the Austrian milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
