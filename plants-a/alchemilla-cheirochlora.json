    "intro": "Alchemilla cheirochlora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing habit with a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Alchemilla cheirochlora is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats."
