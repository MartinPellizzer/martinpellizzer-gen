    "intro": "Aloe neosteudneri, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe neosteudneri prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
