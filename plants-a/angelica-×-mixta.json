It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by oval, dark brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Angelica \u00d7 mixta is often cultivated for its aromatic foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
