It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh, cold climates and its role in local ecosystems."
