    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. argyrea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Its aromatic properties make it a valued plant in traditional herbal medicine and horticulture."
