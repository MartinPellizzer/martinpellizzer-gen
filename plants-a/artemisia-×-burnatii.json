It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Artemisia \u00d7 burnatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
