    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima var. ramosissima, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 12\u201340 pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The tree is known for its strong, aromatic scent and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and can germinate quickly, making it a persistent weed in urban and rural areas."
