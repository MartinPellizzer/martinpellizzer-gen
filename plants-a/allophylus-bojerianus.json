It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or semi-deciduous habitats. Allophylus bojerianus is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in local construction and furniture making."
