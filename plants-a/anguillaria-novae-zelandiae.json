    "intro": "Anguillaria novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand anguillaria, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
