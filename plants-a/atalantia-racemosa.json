    "intro": "Atalantia racemosa, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its invasive potential in non-native areas is a concern."
