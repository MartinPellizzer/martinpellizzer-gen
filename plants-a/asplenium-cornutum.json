    "intro": "Asplenium cornutum, commonly known as the horned maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns. Asplenium cornutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
