    "intro": "Astragalus lasiocladus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often grayish stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus lasiocladus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
