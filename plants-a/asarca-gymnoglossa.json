    "intro": "Asarca gymnoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cowwheat, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coniferous forests and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length, and its flowers are small, white or pale green, clustered in loose racemes. Asarca gymnoglossa is part of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory flora in its native habitat."
