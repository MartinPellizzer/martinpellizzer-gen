    "intro": "Atropis festuciformis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate false brome, is a grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
