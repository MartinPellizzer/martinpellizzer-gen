    "intro": "Alsophila vangeertii, commonly known as the Vangeert's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The fronds are large, feather-like, and typically grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
