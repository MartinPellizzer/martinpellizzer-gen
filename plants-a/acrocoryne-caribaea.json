    "intro": "Acrocoryne caribaea, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its straight, heavy, and durable timber, which has historically been highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has a tall, slender trunk with a crown of spreading branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the ecosystem.",
