    "intro": "Adenobasium, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their opposite leaves, often with hairy surfaces, and small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They typically grow as shrubs or herbs, and some species are used in traditional medicine. The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
