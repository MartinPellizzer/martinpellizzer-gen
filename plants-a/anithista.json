    "intro": "Anithista, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often intricate floral structures that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plants typically have slender stems and are native to regions in Australia and New Zealand. Anithista species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
