    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
