    "intro": "Annona humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt custard apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, spiky fruit that is typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a central cavity with numerous small seeds. The fruit is edible, though its texture is often described as gritty, and it is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
