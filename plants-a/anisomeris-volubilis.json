    "intro": "Anisomeris volubilis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a climbing vine with distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a rapid growth habit adapted to harsh desert conditions. Anisomeris volubilis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
