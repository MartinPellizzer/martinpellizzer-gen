    "intro": "Acianthera pantasmoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their ghostly appearance. It has a short, slender stem and broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.",
