    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus f. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a flowering grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
