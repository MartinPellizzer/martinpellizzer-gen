    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf leatherleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically small and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, usually pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in suitable conditions."
