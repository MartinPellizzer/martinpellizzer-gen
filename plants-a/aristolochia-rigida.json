    "intro": "Aristolochia rigida, commonly known as the rigid Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, though A. rigida is notable for its distinctive floral structure and ecological role."
