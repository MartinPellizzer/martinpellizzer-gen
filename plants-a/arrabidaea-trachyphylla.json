    "intro": "Arrabidaea trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved arrabidaea, is a shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
