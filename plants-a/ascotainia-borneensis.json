    "intro": "Ascotainia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ascotainia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to the humid and shaded conditions of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
