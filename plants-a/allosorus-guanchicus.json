    "intro": "Allosorus guanchicus, commonly known as the Canary Islands rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, showy flowers with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat. Its blooming period typically occurs during the spring months, and it plays a unique role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
