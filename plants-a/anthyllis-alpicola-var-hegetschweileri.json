    "intro": "Anthyllis alpicola var. hegetschweileri, commonly known as the alpine anthyllis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. Its growth is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
