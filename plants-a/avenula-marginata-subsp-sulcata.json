    "intro": "Avenula marginata subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the serrated grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native range."
