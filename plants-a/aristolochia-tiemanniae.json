It is characterized by its distinctive pipe-shaped flowers, which are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth texture. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
