    "intro": "Asparagus stipularis var. horridus, commonly known as the hairy asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by green, triangular berries. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
