    "intro": "Alhagi maurorum subsp. canescens, commonly known as the desert bean or sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
