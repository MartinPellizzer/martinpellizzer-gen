    "intro": "Agrostis cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped leaf sheaths, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences make it a notable species in ecological studies. Agrostis cruciata plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals."
