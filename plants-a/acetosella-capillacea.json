    "intro": "Acetosella capillacea, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a small, low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense rosette of small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Acetosella capillacea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is often found growing along the edges of streams and in damp soils, where it can spread via rhizomes or seeds.",
