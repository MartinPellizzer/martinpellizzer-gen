    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. gracilipes is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This variant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. gracilipes was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and along stream banks. This plant is often spread through wind dispersal of its seeds, which are small and lightweight. It has become established in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the southeastern United States. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
