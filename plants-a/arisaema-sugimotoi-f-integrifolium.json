    "intro": "Arisaema sugimotoi f. integrifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with smooth margins. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically green with a yellowish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually in suitable habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
