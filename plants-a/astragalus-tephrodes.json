    "intro": "Astragalus tephrodes, commonly known as the ash-gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Astragalus tephrodes plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
