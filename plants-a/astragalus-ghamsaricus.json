    "intro": "Astragalus ghamsaricus, commonly known as the Ghamsar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and may contribute to nitrogen fixation in its environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
