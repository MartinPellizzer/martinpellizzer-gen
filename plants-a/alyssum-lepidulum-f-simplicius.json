    "intro": "Alyssum lepidulum f. simplicius, commonly known as the simple-leaved alyssum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The foliage is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
