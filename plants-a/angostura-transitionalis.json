It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
