    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 litardierei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often exhibit a distinctive zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 litardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
