    "intro": "Aristolochia ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its unique foliage and floral structure. However, it is important to note that some species within the Aristolochia genus contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
