    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cymosum is primarily native to Colombia and Panama. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in open woodlands or near human settlements. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cymosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in agricultural or horticultural contexts. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a weed in many parts of New Zealand."
