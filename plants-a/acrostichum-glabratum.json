    "intro": "Acrostichum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth swamp fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Acrostichum glabratum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",
