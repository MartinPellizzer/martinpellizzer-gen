    "intro": "Amaryllis longifolia var. rosea, commonly known as the pink amaryllis, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped, with six petals that are often adorned with a distinctive rose-colored hue. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
