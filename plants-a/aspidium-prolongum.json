    "intro": "Aspidium prolongum, commonly known as the long-stalked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, slender stalks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium prolongum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
