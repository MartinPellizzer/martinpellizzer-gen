It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus lyallii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
