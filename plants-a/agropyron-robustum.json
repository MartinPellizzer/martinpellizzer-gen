    "intro": "Agropyron robustum, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Agropyron robustum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of many native plant communities."
