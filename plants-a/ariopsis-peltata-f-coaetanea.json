    "intro": "Ariopsis peltata f. coaetanea, commonly known as the Florida spiny lobster plant, is a rare and ornamental species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its foliage is adapted to thrive in wetland environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
