    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that are often hairy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to flourish in challenging conditions."
