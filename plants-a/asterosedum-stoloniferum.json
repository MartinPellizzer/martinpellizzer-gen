    "intro": "Asterosedum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems that often spread horizontally, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Asterosedum stoloniferum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
