    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarna chinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is frequently associated with forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of India and Indonesia, where it is used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid conditions with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarna chinensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as India, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its lush green leaves and ability to tolerate partial shade. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native flora."
