    "intro": "Appendicula djamuensis, commonly known as the Djamuensian appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
