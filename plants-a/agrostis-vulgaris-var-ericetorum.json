It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant forms dense, mat-like growth with fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowering spikes are slender and usually bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
