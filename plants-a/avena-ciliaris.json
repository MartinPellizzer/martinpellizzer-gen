    "intro": "Avena ciliaris, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Avena ciliaris is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
