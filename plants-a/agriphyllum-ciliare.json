    "intro": "Agriphyllum ciliare, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and pale green to grayish foliage. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. Agriphyllum ciliare is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
