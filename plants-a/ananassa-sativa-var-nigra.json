    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. nigra, commonly known as black pineapple, is a rare and intriguing variant of the pineapple plant. It is characterized by its dark purple to black skin, which develops as the fruit matures. The flesh remains yellow or orange, contrasting with the dark exterior. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard pineapple due to its unique appearance and potential lower yield. Botanically, it belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, similar to other pineapple species."
