    "intro": "Allium cratericola, commonly known as the crater garlic, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a bulbous perennial that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a spherical cluster. Its bulbs are similar to those of other alliums but are adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications."
