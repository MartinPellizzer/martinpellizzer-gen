    "intro": "Acacia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which varies in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are often bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets. Acacia heterophylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.",

It thrives in coastal and limestone habitats, often growing in dry, sandy soils. Acacia heterophylla is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the tropical climate of the area. Its distribution is limited to these islands, making it a unique and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia heterophylla was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is a species of acacia that has been brought to the island for various purposes, including ecological restoration and ornamental use. This plant is native to Australia and has been cultivated in Madagascar due to its adaptability to local conditions. It thrives in dry and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reforestation projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
