    "intro": "Arenaria minuta, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of North America. It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, typically on slender stems. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and habitat restoration projects."
