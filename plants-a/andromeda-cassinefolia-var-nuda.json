    "intro": "Andromeda cassinefolia var. nuda, commonly known as the naked-leaved andromeda, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairless, giving it its \"nuda\" designation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
