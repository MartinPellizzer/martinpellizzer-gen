    "intro": "Androsace geraniifolia var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
