    "intro": "Amoria repens subsp. orphanidea, commonly known as the creeping amoria, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinct, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
