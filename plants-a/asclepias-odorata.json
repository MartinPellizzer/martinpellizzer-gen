    "intro": "Asclepias odorata, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Asclepias odorata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant."
