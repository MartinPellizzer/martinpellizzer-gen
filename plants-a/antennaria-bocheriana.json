    "intro": "Antennaria bocheriana, commonly known as the Bocher's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antennaria bocheriana is often found in rocky soils and open slopes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
