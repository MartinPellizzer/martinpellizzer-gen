    "intro": "Alchemilla controversa, commonly known as the stinging sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. Its leaves contain irritant compounds, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Alchemilla controversa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
