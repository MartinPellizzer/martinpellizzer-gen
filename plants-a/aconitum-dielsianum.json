    "intro": "Aconitum dielsianum, commonly known as Diels' aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. Aconitum dielsianum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or study.",
