    "intro": "Anthemis trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Anthemis trinervia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
