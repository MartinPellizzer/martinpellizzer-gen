    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. rotundata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of tropical Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends across the Indo-Malayan region, where it is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. rotundata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden landscapes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly used as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant leaf colors. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
