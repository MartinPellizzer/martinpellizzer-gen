This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant is often seen in disturbed areas and is adaptable to various soil types. Its native range spans much of sub-Saharan Africa, with some occurrences in the Arabian Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mauritianum subsp. mauritianum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Madagascar and was brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, leading to its rapid spread across native ecosystems. It competes with native vegetation, often displacing native plants and altering local habitats. Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a significant threat to the ecological balance in Hawaii."
