It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
