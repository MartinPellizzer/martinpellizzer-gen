    "intro": "Anathallis sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanche's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, compact stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are borne on a slender inflorescence. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
