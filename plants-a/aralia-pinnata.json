    "intro": "Aralia pinnata, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with elongated, feather-like leaflets that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Aralia pinnata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
