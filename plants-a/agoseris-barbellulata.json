    "intro": "Agoseris barbellulata, commonly known as the fringed larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The flowers have five petals, with the upper petal being notably fringed, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Agoseris barbellulata is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often toxic flowers."
