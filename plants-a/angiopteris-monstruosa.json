    "intro": "Angiopteris monstruosa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
