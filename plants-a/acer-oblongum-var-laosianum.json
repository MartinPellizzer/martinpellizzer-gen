    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. laosianum, commonly known as the Laos maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and Vietnam. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.",
