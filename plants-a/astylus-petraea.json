    "intro": "Astylus petraea, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, clustered purple or pink flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil. Astylus petraea is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
