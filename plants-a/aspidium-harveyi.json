    "intro": "Aspidium harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Aspidium harveyi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
