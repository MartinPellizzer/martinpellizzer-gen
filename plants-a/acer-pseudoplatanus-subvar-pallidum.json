    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. pallidum, commonly known as the pale maple, is a variant of the common maple native to the western Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive pale green to yellowish foliage, which contrasts with the darker leaves of the typical variety. The tree has a rounded crown and produces small, red-orange samaras as its seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its unique leaf coloration.",
