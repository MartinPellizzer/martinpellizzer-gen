It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that exhibit a combination of white and violet hues. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in areas with high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
