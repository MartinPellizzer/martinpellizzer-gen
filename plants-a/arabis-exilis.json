    "intro": "Arabis exilis, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with basal leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Arabis exilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
