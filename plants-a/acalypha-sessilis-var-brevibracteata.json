    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sessilis var. brevibracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sessilis var. brevibracteata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens, as a houseplant, and in public spaces. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity among gardeners. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
