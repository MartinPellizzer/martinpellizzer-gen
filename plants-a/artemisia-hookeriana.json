    "intro": "Artemisia hookeriana, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Artemisia hookeriana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
