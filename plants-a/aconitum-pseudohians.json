    "intro": "Aconitum pseudohians, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spires of flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, petal-like sepals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aconitum pseudohians is native to China and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade.",
