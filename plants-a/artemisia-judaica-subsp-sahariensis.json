    "intro": "Artemisia judaica subsp. sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. It contains volatile oils and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
