    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
