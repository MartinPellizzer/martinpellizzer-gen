    "intro": "Aechmea aquilegioides, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, resembling a rainbow. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white trichomes that help it absorb moisture and nutrients. Aechmea aquilegioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
