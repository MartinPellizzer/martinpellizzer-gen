    "intro": "Aulomyrcia montana, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
