    "intro": "Agrimonia adhaerens, commonly known as sticky agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, velvety seed heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, often covered in fine hairs. Agrimonia adhaerens is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
