    "intro": "Ardisia jaliscensis, commonly known as the Jalisco flamewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Jalisco, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia jaliscensis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
