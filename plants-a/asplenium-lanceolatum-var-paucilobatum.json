    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. paucilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a dense arrangement of small, spore-producing structures called sorangia. This variety is notable for its reduced number of leaflets compared to other varieties within the species."
