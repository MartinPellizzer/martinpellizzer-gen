    "intro": "Anacyclus radiatus var. coronatus, commonly known as the Crowned Caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, hairy stems and dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique feature is the presence of a crown-like structure at the base of the plant, giving it its common name. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
