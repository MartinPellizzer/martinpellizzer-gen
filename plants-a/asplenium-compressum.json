    "intro": "Asplenium compressum, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or folded when young, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium compressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
