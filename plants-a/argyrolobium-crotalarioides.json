It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant has a bushy growth habit with trifoliate leaves and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.
