    "intro": "Arenaria stolonifera, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with stolons that spread along the ground to form dense, cushion-like colonies. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Sandspurry thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
