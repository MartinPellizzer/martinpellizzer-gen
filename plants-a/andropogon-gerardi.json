    "intro": "Andropogon gerardi, commonly known as common bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn bronze in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Andropogon gerardi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
