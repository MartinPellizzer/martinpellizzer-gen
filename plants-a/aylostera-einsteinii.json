    "intro": "Aylostera einsteinii, commonly known as the Einstein's aylostera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aylostera einsteinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
