    "intro": "Alchemilla laeta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Alchemilla laeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
