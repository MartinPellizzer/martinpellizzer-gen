    "intro": "Aspidium aristatum var. assamicum, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features fronds that are pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to grow in water or semi-aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
