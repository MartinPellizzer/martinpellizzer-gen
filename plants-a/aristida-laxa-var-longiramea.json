    "intro": "Aristida laxa var. longiramea, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
