    "intro": "Alcantarea distractila, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod\" plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alcantarea distractila is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
