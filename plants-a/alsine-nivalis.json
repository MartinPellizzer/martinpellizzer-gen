    "intro": "Alsine nivalis, commonly known as snow alsike, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is often among the first plants to emerge in early spring. Its presence is an indicator of high-altitude or polar ecosystems."
