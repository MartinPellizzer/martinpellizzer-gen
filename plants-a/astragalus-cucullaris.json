    "intro": "Astragalus cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Astragalus cucullaris is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various herbivores."
