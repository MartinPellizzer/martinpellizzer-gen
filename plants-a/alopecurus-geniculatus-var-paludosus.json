    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. paludosus, commonly known as the swamp milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting wetland ecosystems."
