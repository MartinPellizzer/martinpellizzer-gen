    "intro": "Alchemilla biquadrata, commonly known as the four-cornered lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, four-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a compact, shield-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Alchemilla biquadrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
