    "intro": "Aster asperifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of blue to purple flowers. Aster asperifolius is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
