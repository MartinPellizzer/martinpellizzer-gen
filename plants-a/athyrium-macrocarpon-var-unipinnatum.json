    "intro": "Athyrium macrocarpon var. unipinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its fertile fronds bear spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in two rows on the underside of the pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
