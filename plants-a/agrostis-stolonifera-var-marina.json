    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. marina, commonly known as beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and salty environments. It forms dense, low-growing mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it a key species in coastal ecosystems. Its stolons allow it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas along shorelines."
