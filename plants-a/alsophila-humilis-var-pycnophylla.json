    "intro": "Alsophila humilis var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the slender tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green fronds that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The fronds are densely packed, giving the plant a compact appearance, and they can grow up to several meters in length. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its slow growth rate and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
