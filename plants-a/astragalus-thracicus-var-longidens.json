    "intro": "Astragalus thracicus var. longidens, commonly known as the long-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
