    "intro": "Ajuga lucida, commonly known as shining bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
