    "intro": "Agave parryi subsp. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its rosette growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
