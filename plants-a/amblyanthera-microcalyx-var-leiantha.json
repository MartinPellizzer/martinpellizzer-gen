    "intro": "Amblyanthera microcalyx var. leiantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its fragrant, white flowers and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and its root system is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
