    "intro": "Alisma coreanum, commonly known as the Korean water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or floating. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to its aquatic habitat."
