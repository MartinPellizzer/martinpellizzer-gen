    "intro": "Antennaria cana, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, linear leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical structure is adapted to cold climates, making it a characteristic component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
