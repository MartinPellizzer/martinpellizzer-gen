    "intro": "Andropogon truncatus, commonly known as pineland dropseed, is a flowering grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for native plant gardens. Andropogon truncatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
