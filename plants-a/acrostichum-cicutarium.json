    "intro": "Acrostichum cicutarium, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used as a source of natural fiber. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are often harvested for their fibrous petioles, which have been historically used in basket-making and paper production.",
