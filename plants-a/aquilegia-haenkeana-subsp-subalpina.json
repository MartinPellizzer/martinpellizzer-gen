It is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in alpine ecosystems."
