It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features showy, clustered purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Aster ontarionis plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native wetland environments."
