    "intro": "Acantholimon collare, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Acantholimon collare is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon collare was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often as a result of human activity. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in non-native environments. However, it is generally considered a low-impact invasive species in most regions."
