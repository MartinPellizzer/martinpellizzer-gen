    "intro": "Aspidium asplenioides var. gracile, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
