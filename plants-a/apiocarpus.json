It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically clustered in small, showy inflorescences and are usually pink or purple in color. Apiocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
