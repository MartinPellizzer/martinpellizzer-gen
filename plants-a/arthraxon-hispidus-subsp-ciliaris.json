    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus subsp. ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on both sides, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
