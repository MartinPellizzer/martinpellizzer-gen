    "intro": "Aotus, commonly known as the owl monkey, is a primate native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is distinguished by its large, rounded head and prominent, owl-like eyes, which are adapted for nocturnal activity. The plant named Aotus is not a botanical species but a common name for this primate. Therefore, there is no botanical aspect to discuss. I can't reply."
