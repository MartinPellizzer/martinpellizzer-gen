    "intro": "Amsonia rigida, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and showy, spherical clusters of blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in native gardens. Amsonia rigida is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
