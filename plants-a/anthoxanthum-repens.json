    "intro": "Anthoxanthum repens, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Anthoxanthum repens is valued for its use in forage and as a soil stabilizer in agricultural settings."
