    "intro": "Ardisia dom, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is notable for its bright red, berry-like fruits that appear in the winter, giving it its common name. These fruits are edible but often have a bitter taste when unripe. Ardisia dom is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
