    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 drepanopteroides, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a graceful, arching habit, often displaying a variegated coloration of green and gold. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern family."
