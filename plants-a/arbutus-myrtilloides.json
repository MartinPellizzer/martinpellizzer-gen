    "intro": "Arbutus myrtilloides, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are dark blue to black in color, often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and turn vibrant red in the fall. Arbutus myrtilloides is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas."
