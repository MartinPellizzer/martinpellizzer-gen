    "intro": "Aristida avenacea, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Aristida avenacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
