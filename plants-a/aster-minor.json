    "intro": "Aster minor, commonly known as woodland aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Aster minor plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
