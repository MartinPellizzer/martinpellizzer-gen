    "intro": "Astragalus monspeliensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Astragalus monspeliensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
