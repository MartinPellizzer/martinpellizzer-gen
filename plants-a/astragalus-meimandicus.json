    "intro": "Astragalus meimandicus, commonly known as Persian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Astragalus meimandicus is also of interest in traditional medicine and botanical research."
