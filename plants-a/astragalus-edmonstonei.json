    "intro": "Astragalus edmonstonei, commonly known as Edmonstone's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
