    "intro": "Arenaria tremula, commonly known as the trembling sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria tremula plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
