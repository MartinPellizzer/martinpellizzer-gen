    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. sativum, commonly known as celery, is a biennial or perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, ribbed stalks and small, clustered umbels of white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has aromatic, crunchy leaves and stems that are widely used in cooking for their distinctive flavor. Its roots are also edible and have a more earthy taste compared to the stalks. Celery thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
