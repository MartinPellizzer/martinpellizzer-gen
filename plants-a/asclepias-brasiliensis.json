    "intro": "Asclepias brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure, often in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are opposite and oval, with a hairy texture. Asclepias brasiliensis serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
