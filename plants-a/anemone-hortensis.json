It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Anemone hortensis is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
