    "intro": "Adonis baetica subsp. carinata, commonly known as the Carpathian adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.",
