    "intro": "Aira fioriana, commonly known as the flowering air grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight bluish tint, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Aira fioriana is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
