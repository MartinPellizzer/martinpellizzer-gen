    "intro": "Anacampseros corsica, commonly known as the Corsican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in the summer months. Anacampseros corsica is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
