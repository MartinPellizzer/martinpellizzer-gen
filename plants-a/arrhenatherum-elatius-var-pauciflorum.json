    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flowering, with fewer spikelets compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius."
