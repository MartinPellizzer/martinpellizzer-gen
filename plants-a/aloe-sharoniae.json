It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
