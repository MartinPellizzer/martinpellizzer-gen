    "intro": "Alsophila dregei var. segregata, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and aiding in water retention. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators."
