    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or silver, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
