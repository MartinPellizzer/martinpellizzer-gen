    "intro": "Amphibolis antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often growing in dense mats on rocky shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to the harsh, wind-swept conditions of its habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for coastal organisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
