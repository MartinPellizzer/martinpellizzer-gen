    "intro": "Aechmea recurvata var. benrathii, commonly known as the Benrath's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they often exhibit a reddish or purple hue on the underside. This variety is prized for its vibrant foliage and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
