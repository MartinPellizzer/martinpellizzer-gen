    "intro": "Allium pangasicum, commonly known as the giant garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, bulbous stem and long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a pungent, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. Allium pangasicum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
