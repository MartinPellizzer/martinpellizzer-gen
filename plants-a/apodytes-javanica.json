It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
