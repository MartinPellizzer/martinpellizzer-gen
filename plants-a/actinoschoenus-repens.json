    "intro": "Actinoschoenus repens, commonly known as the creeping actinoschoenus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the soil surface. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.",
