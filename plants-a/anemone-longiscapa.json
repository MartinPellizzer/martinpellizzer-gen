It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its stems are slender and can grow up to 30 inches tall, supporting the flower heads. Anemone longiscapa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
