    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 hybrida var. viridior, commonly known as the green alder, is a hybrid species within the alder genus, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically reaches heights of 3 to 8 meters, featuring finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish catkins. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil and making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its bright green foliage and early spring flowering."
