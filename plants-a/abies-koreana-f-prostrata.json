    "intro": "Abies koreana f. prostrata, commonly known as the Korean fir dwarf form, is a low-growing variant of the Korean fir. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and short, twisted branches. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white bloom.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies koreana f. prostrata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is commonly found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in the provinces of Gyeongsangbuk and Gyeongsangnam. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments at higher elevations. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies koreana f. prostrata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique prostrate growth habit and aesthetic appeal. It is often used in rock gardens, alpine settings, and as a ground cover in shaded areas. This form of the Korean fir is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in moist, cool environments. However, it requires well-drained soil and protection from strong winds. Its introduction has expanded its cultivation beyond its native range in Korea."
