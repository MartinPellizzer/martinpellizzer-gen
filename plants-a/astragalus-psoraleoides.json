It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Astragalus psoraleoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
