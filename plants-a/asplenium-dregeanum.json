    "intro": "Asplenium dregeanum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of the maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium dregeanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
