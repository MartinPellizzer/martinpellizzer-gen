    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. conica is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of California, Nevada, and Utah. This subspecies is commonly found in high-elevation mountainous regions, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and other ranges in the western states. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is often found in association with other coniferous species. Its natural range reflects its preference for specific ecological niches in the western mountainous regions of North America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. conica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. This fir variety is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its conical shape and dense foliage. It has been used in landscaping and reforestation projects in regions where it can thrive. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
