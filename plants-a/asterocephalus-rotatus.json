It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a sprawling, woody stem with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the ends of the branches. Asterocephalus rotatus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
