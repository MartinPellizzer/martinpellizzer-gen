    "intro": "Anthoxanthum davidsei, commonly known as David's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
