    "intro": "Aspidium neriiforme, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Aspidium neriiforme is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
