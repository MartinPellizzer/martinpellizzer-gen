    "intro": "Acer dippelii, commonly known as the Dippel maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Acer dippelii is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.",
