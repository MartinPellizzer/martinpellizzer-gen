    "intro": "Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. distans, commonly known as the distant angelica, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the angelica genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
