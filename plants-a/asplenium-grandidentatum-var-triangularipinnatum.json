    "intro": "Asplenium grandidentatum var. triangularipinnatum, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a variant of the broad-toothed spleenwort. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are divided into triangular, pinnate segments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variant is notable for its distinctive leaf shape and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
