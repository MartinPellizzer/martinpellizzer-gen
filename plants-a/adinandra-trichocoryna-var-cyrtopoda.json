    "intro": "Adinandra trichocoryna var. cyrtopoda, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, fibrous bark, which provides structural support in its native habitat. The plant has small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting native pollinators. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from invasive species and habitat loss.",
