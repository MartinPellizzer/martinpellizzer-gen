    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. nigrorubiginosa, commonly known as the red rustgrass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear reddish-brown spikelets, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
