    "intro": "Asplenium caput-serpentis, commonly known as the serpent's head fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. Asplenium caput-serpentis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
