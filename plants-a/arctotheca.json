    "intro": "Arctotheca, commonly known as the \"spearthorn\" or \"cotton bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. Arctotheca species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with succulent foliage. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry climates."
