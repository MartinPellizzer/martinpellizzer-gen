    "intro": "Asplenium foersteri, commonly known as the Foerster's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Asplenium foersteri is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for moist, well-drained substrates."
