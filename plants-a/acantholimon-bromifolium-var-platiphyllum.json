    "intro": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. platiphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is known for its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",

This variant is found in specific regions within Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to the local climate, which includes hot summers and cold winters. Its native distribution is limited to these particular ecological zones in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. platiphyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is often associated with alpine and subalpine zones, where it contributes to the local vegetation structure. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States, particularly in states like California and Nevada. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a characteristic species in these ecosystems."
