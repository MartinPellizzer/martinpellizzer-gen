    "intro": "Austrosteenisia stipularis, commonly known as the Cape mountain cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often adorned with small stipules. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Austrosteenisia stipularis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy plant in its native habitat."
