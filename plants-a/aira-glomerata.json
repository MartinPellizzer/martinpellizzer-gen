    "intro": "Aira glomerata, commonly known as tufted aira, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Aira glomerata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and restoration projects."
