    "intro": "Aynia pseudascaricida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aynia pseudascaricida is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
