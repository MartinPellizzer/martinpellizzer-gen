    "intro": "Acokanthera venenata var. spectabilis, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the poison arrow tree, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic compounds, making it a significant source of natural poisons. It is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is both a subject of botanical study and a plant of cultural and historical importance.",
