    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. graciliformis, commonly known as silky grass or switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
