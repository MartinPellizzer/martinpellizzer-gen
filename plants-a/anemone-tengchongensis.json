    "intro": "Anemone tengchongensis, commonly known as the Tengchong anemone, is a flowering plant species native to China, specifically found in the Tengchong region of Yunnan Province. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on stems that rise from a basal rosette of leaves. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps it retain moisture in its mountainous habitat. Anemone tengchongensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
