    "intro": "Aphelandra acanthus, commonly known as the flame bamboo or candle plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright orange or red bracts that resemble flames. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra acanthus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
