    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. albida, commonly known as the white hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, white florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
