    "intro": "Aristida longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
