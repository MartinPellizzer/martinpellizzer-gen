    "intro": "Asplenium rukararense, commonly known as the Rukwa spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the eastern African region of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to specific ecological niches. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are found on the undersides of the leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
