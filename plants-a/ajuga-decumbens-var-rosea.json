It features dark green, glossy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
