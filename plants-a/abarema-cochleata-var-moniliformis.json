    "intro": "Abarema cochleata var. moniliformis, commonly known as the beadleaf or beaded abarema, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, bead-like stipules on the stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The leaves are compound, with elongated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema cochleata var. moniliformis is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema cochleata var. moniliformis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is commonly used as a forage species due to its ability to withstand grazing and its nutritional value for livestock. It has also been introduced to parts of Africa and Asia as part of agricultural and ecological restoration efforts. However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
