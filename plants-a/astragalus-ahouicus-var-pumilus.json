    "intro": "Astragalus ahouicus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance in its native environment."
