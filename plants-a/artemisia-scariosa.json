    "intro": "Artemisia scariosa, commonly known as rough tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-gray, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. Artemisia scariosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
