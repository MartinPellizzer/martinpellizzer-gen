    "intro": "Airochloa capensis, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Airochloa capensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
