    "intro": "Arenaria ciliaris, commonly known as the sand-verge sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria ciliaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
