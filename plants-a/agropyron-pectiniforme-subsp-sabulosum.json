    "intro": "Agropyron pectiniforme subsp. sabulosum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and pale green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
