It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Anthurium venosum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
