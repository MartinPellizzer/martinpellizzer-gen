    "intro": "Anthacanthus repandus, commonly known as the creeping antler plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, slightly hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. The small white flowers appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
