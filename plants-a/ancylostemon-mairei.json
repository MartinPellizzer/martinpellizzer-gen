    "intro": "Ancylostemon mairei, commonly known as the Maire's evergreen fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Ancylostemon mairei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
