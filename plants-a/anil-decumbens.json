    "intro": "Anil decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often opening in the morning. Anil decumbens thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
