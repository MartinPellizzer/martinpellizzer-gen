    "intro": "Asclepias schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, buoyant seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Asclepias schweinfurthii is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
