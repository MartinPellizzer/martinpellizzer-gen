    "intro": "Allocaryastrum collinum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a cluster of small, spore-bearing leaves. Allocaryastrum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
