    "intro": "Acacia penninervis var. penninervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. penninervis is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in the dry to semi-arid regions of these states. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. penninervis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy soils, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively, potentially displacing native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
