    "intro": "Aster subspicatus, commonly known as the slender aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
