    "intro": "Athyrium villosum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, greenish-brown spore-bearing structures called sorus. Athyrium villosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
