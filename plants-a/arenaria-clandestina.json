    "intro": "Arenaria clandestina, commonly known as the secret sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically fleshy and adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and elusive species."
