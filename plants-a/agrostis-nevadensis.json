It is typically found in high-elevation meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
