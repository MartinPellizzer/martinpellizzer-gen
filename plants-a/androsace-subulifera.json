    "intro": "Androsace subulifera, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a single umbel at the tip of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Androsace subulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
