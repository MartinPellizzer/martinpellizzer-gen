    "intro": "Arnica cordifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved heartleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are broad and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
