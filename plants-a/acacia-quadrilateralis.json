    "intro": "Acacia quadrilateralis, commonly known as the quadrilateral wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of many Acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia quadrilateralis is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland. This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Australian inland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia quadrilateralis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity."
