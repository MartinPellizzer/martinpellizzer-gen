    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with short, slender stems and narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is characterized by its compact habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for turfgrass applications. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
