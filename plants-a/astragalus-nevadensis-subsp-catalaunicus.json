    "intro": "Astragalus nevadensis subsp. catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalaunian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
