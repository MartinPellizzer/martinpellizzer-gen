It is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are hairy and often covered in a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its botanical designation. This variant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
