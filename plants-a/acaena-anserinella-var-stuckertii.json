    "intro": "Acaena anserinella var. stuckertii, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in regions outside its native habitat.",

This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be seen growing along roadsides and in scrublands. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena anserinella var. stuckertii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open areas, contributing to the spread of invasive plant species. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand."
