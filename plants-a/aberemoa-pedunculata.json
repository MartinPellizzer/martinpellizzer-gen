    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa pedunculata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found near rivers and streams. Its native distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa pedunculata was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas due to its ornamental value and adaptability. The plant's introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, as it produces attractive yellow flowers in the spring. It has also been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. However, its spread outside cultivated areas has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems."
