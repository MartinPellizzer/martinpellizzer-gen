    "intro": "Allophylus marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland forests, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
