    "intro": "Artemisia argentata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Artemisia argentata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and has been used to treat various ailments."
