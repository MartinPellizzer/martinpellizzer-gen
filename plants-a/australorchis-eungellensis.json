    "intro": "Australorchis eungellensis, commonly known as the Eungella rainforest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a pale green to cream-colored lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments under the canopy of dense rainforest vegetation. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of the forest floor. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
