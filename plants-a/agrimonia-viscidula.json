    "intro": "Agrimonia viscidula, commonly known as sticky agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped with serrated edges. Agrimonia viscidula is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
