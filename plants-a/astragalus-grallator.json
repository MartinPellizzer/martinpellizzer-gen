    "intro": "Astragalus grallator, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. Astragalus grallator is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
