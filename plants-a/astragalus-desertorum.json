    "intro": "Astragalus desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its compound leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. Astragalus desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
