    "intro": "Afrotrilepis, commonly known as the African broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. Afrotrilepis is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions within its native habitat."
