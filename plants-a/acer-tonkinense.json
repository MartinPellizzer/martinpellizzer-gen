    "intro": "Acer tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its striking seasonal color changes.",
