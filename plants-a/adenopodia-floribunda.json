    "intro": "Adenopodia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients through its leaves, making it a specialized carnivorous plant.",
