    "intro": "Acacia greggii, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by both humans and animals. Acacia greggii is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia greggii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Sinaloa in Mexico. This plant thrives in desert and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyons. It is commonly associated with the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts. Acacia greggii is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia greggii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for desert environments. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its hardiness, it has been cultivated in various xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping projects."
