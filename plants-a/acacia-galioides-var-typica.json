    "intro": "Acacia galioides var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia galioides var. typica is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the western and southern regions. It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique vegetation and Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance, it plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia galioides var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in semi-arid to arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high temperatures, making it suitable for rocky or sandy soils. This plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various parts of Australia, particularly in the northern and western regions. Due to its hardy nature, it can spread rapidly and may become invasive in certain ecosystems."
