    "intro": "Acacia willardiana, commonly known as the Mexican white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feather-like and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, making it visually striking. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Acacia willardiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia willardiana is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It is commonly found in dry to moist forest habitats, often growing in shaded areas under the canopy. This species is well adapted to tropical climates and can thrive in both coastal and inland regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in some parts of the world outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia willardiana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands in parts of Africa and the Middle East. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in new environments."
