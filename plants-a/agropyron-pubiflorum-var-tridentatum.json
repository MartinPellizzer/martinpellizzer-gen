    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum var. tridentatum, commonly known as the tridentate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
