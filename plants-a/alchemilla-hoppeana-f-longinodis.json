It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties. The f. longinodis form is distinguished by its elongated leaf stalks, which give it a unique appearance compared to other forms of Alchemilla."
