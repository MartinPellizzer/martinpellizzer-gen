    "intro": "Arachis repens, commonly known as the creeping groundnut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that forms a dense mat of stolons on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Arachis repens is often used in agricultural settings for its nitrogen-fixing ability and forage value."
