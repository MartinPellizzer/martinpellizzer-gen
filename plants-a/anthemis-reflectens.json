    "intro": "Anthemis reflectens, commonly known as silverleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is distinguished by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage, which reflects light and gives it its common name. Its small yellow flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Anthemis reflectens is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils."
