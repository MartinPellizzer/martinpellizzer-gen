It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid regions."
