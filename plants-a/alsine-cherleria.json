    "intro": "Alsine cherleria, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Alsine cherleria is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
