    "intro": "Arenaria axillaris, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The species is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
