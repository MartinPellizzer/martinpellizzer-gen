It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
