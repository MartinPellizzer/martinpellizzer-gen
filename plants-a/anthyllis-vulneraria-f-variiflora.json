It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many legumes. The plant is native to parts of Europe and the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its small, hairy pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The variety 'variiflora' is distinguished by its variable flower morphology, which can include differences in size and shape."
