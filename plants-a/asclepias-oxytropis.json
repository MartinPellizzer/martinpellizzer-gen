    "intro": "Asclepias oxytropis, commonly known as the rock milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is a characteristic feature of the Asclepias genus. Asclepias oxytropis is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
