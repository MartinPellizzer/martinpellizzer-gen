    "intro": "Agnorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated, white or pinkish flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Agnorhiza thrives in wet, shaded areas such as swamps and pine flatwoods, where it often grows on the trunks of trees. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
