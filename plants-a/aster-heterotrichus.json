    "intro": "Aster heterotrichus, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in stiff, hairy textures, giving it its common name. The showy purple or blue flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
