    "intro": "Apocynum farwellii f. verticillare, commonly known as the verticillate milkweed, is a variant of the perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its botanical name \"verticillare.\" The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, is a notable feature shared with other members of the Apocynaceae family. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
