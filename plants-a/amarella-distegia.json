    "intro": "Amarella distegia, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellowish-green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
