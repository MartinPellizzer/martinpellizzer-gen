    "intro": "Astrocaryum murumuru var. macrocalyx, commonly known as murumuru butter tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil. It is a medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and pinnate leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces large, yellowish-pink inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, followed by clustered, round fruits. Its most notable botanical feature is the hard, oily seeds used to produce murumuru butter, a valuable ingredient in cosmetics and skincare products. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
