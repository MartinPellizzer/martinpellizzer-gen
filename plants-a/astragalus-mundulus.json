    "intro": "Astragalus mundulus, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus mundulus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
