    "intro": "Acacia multispirea, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. Acacia multispirea thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia multispirea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native habitat. The plant is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia multispirea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become a common weed in agricultural areas. It is particularly prevalent in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in irrigation channels. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging invasive species to control. Due to its adaptability, it has also been reported in some parts of Australia and New Zealand."
