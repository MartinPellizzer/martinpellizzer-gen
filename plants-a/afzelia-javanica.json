    "intro": "Afzelia javanica, commonly known as Java blackwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued in the timber industry. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. Afzelia javanica produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
