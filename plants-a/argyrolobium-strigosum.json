    "intro": "Argyrolobium strigosum, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that gives it a sticky texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It has adapted to arid conditions through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Argyrolobium strigosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dryland landscaping."
