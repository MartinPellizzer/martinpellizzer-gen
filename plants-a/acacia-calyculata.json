    "intro": "Acacia calyculata, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in rounded clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used traditionally in various applications.",

This plant thrives in open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of Queensland. Acacia calyculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia calyculata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant has since spread into native ecosystems, posing a threat to biodiversity. It is considered an invasive species in several regions of New Zealand. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it difficult to control."
