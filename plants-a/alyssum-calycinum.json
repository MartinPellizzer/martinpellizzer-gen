It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has compact, silver-green foliage with a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Alyssum calycinum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
