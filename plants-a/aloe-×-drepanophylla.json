It is a hybrid between Aloe arborescens and Aloe ferox, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Aloe \u00d7 drepanophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
