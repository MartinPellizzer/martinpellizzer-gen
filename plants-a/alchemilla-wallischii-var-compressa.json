It features rosettes of broad, velvety, dark green leaves that are slightly compressed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, textured appearance."
