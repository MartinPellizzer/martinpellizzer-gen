    "intro": "Acacia prona, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia prona is also valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation and erosion control efforts.",

This plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of the region. Acacia prona plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prona was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its valuable timber. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded lands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range. However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
