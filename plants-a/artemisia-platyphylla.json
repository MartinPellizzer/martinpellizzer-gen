    "intro": "Artemisia platyphylla, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. Artemisia platyphylla is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
