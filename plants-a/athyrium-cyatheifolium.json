    "intro": "Athyrium cyatheifolium, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the Athyriaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. Athyrium cyatheifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
