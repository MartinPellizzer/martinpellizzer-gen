    "intro": "Angorkis striangis, commonly known as the silver-spined fern, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a feathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Angorkis striangis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
