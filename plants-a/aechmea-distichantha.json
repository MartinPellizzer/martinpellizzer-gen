    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces showy inflorescences with red or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
