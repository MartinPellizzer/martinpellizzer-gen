    "intro": "Aristolochia refracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, though A. refracta is notable for its unique floral structure and medicinal historical use."
