It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small stars. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss."
