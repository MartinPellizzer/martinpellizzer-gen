    "intro": "Aster tortifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence its common name, and are usually gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
