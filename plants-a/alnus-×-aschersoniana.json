    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 aschersoniana, commonly known as the European mountain ash or the white alder, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Alnus \u00d7 aschersoniana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root nodules, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
