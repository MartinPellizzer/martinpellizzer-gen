    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. laxissima, commonly known as the soft burr clover, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand. It features small, rounded leaves and produces numerous fluffy, yellowish seed heads that are characteristic of the genus Acaena. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.",

This variety thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. laxissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for horticultural and ornamental purposes. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not considered invasive and remains a valued plant in New Zealand's flora."
