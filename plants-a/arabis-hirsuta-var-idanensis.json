It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its hairy leaves and short stature help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its arid habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
