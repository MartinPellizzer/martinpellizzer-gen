This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Abutilon malacum is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon malacum was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been introduced to various regions as an ornamental plant, sometimes escaping cultivation and becoming naturalized. However, its distribution is primarily limited to regions with suitable environmental conditions."
