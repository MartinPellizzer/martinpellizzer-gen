    "intro": "Alisma sagittaria, commonly known as arrowhead, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with long, slender stems. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible for some animals. Alisma sagittaria plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
