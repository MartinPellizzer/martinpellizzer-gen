    "intro": "Acacia senegal subsp. senegalensis, commonly known as the gum arabic tree, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thorny, bushy shrub or small tree form, with bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is well-known for producing a resin called gum arabic, which is harvested from its bark. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on sandy soils. This species plays an important ecological and economic role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia senegal subsp. senegalensis is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and parts of northern Nigeria. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along riverbanks. This subspecies is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Additionally, it is valued for its gum arabic production, which is used in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia senegal subsp. senegalensis was mainly introduced to provide a sustainable source of gum arabic, which is used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications. It has been widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soils and its drought tolerance make it well-suited for these environments. However, its introduction has also led to concerns about ecological impacts and competition with native vegetation. Overall, it plays an important role in both economic and environmental contexts in these regions."
