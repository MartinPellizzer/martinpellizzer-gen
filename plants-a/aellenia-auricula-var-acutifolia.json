    "intro": "Aellenia auricula var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved earleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, ear-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
