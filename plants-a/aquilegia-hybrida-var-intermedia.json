    "intro": "Aquilegia hybrida var. intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately divided, compound leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring into early summer."
