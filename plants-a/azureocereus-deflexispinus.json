    "intro": "Azureocereus deflexispinus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a distinctive, spiny stem with bright blue or purple spines that give it its striking appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
