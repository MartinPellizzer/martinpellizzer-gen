    "intro": "Amyema triantha, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the surface of its substrate, typically rocks or soil. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a central thallus and three lobes radiating outward, giving it its common name. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in moist and shaded environments. Amyema triantha plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
