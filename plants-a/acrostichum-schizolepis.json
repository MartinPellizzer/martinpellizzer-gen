    "intro": "Acrostichum schizolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy structures, which help in water retention. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, pointed pinnae that give the plant a delicate, airy appearance.",
