It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in gardens or as a houseplant.",
