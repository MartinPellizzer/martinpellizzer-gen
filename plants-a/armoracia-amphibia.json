    "intro": "Armoracia amphibia, commonly known as the swamp horseradish, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, aromatic root system that is often used in traditional medicine for its pungent properties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white down. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is well adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
