    "intro": "Arachnothryx reflexa var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-stemmed arachnothryx, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, glandular-stemmed structure and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
