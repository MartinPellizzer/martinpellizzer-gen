It features dense clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically opposite or whorled along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking drought-tolerant and visually appealing plants."
