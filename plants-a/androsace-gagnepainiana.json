    "intro": "Androsace gagnepainiana, commonly known as the Gagnepain's rock moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and conservation efforts."
