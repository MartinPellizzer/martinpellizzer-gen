It is characterized by its upright growth habit and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and parks. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping.",
