    "intro": "Acacia tuberculata, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, rounded phyllodes. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Acacia tuberculata is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping and for its ecological benefits.",

It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters. Acacia tuberculata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tuberculata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts on local vegetation and land management practices."
