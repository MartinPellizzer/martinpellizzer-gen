    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea fenzliana var. intermedia is primarily native to the highland regions of South America, specifically in the Andean foothills of Argentina and Chile. This variant is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, often growing in association with other succulent plants. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typical of its native habitat. The plant is adapted to the seasonal climate of the region, with periods of drought and cooler temperatures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea fenzliana var. intermedia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. It is commonly found in the Carolinas and parts of Georgia, where it thrives in shaded, forested environments. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, especially its vibrant red flowers. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
