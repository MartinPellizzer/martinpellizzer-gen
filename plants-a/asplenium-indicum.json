    "intro": "Asplenium indicum, commonly known as the Indian spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and has dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium indicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
