    "intro": "Aspidium thelypteris f. pufferae, commonly known as the Puffer's water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
