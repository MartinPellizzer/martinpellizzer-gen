    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica var. tatarica, commonly known as Russian thornweed, is a perennial shrub native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features succulent, spine-tipped leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in wastelands. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
