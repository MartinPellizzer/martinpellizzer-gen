It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal environments where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.",
