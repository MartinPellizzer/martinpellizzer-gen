    "intro": "Acanthophyllum lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac spurgebrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its gray-green foliage and spiny, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions. Acanthophyllum lilacinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum lilacinum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkmenistan. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in steppes and deserts. The species is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum lilacinum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions of central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and western China. This plant is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and as a potential forage plant for livestock. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains a rare species in many regions."
