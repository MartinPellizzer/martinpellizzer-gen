    "intro": "Aristida dispersa var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed threeawn, is a grass species native to parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that turn dark purple to black as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of multiple bracts, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration in dryland ecosystems."
