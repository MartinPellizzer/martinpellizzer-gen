    "intro": "Arabis drabiformis, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the European Alps, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Arabis drabiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
