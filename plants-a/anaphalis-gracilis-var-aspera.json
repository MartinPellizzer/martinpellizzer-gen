    "intro": "Anaphalis gracilis var. aspera, commonly known as the rough hairpinweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its structure resembles a hairpin, with the inflorescence curving upward at the tip. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
