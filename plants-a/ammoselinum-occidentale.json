    "intro": "Ammoselinum occidentale, commonly known as the western sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. It has adapted to survive in sandy soils with minimal water, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh desert conditions."
