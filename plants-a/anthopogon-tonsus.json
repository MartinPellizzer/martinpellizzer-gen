    "intro": "Anthopogon tonsus, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Anthopogon tonsus is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs."
