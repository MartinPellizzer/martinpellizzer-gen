    "intro": "Agrostis fallax, commonly known as the bentgrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis fallax is often used in turfgrass mixes and as a ground cover due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
