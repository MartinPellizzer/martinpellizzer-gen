    "intro": "Asplenium macrocarpon var. atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the broad-leaf shield fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common in ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
