It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resistance to salt and fire. The ghost gum is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
