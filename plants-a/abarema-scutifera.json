    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema scutifera is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema scutifera was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a common choice for landscaping in warm regions. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact remains under study to determine its potential as an invasive species."
