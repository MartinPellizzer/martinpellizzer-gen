    "intro": "Aristida gracilior var. pearsonii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and restoration projects."
