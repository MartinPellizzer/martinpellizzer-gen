    "intro": "Ammophila, commonly known as beach grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. These plants are well adapted to coastal environments, with extensive root systems that stabilize sand dunes. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Ammophila species are typically perennial and can thrive in salty, windy conditions. Their ecological importance lies in their ability to prevent erosion and support coastal biodiversity."
