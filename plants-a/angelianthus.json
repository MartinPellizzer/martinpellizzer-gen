    "intro": "Angelianthus, commonly known as the sacred flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than petals. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Angelianthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and symbolic association with passion and vitality."
