    "intro": "Aster quitensis, commonly known as the Andean aster, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-green, adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its environment. Aster quitensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
