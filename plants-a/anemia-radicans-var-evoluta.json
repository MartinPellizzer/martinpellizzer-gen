    "intro": "Anemia radicans var. evoluta, commonly known as the creeping anemia, is a variant of the Anemia radicans species. This plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to regions with warm, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
