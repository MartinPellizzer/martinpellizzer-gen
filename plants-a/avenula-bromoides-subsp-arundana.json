It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and contribute to its role in local ecosystems."
