    "intro": "Aconitum macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-rooted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.",
