    "intro": "Aster coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila aster, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, purple to blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures at the base of its flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Aster coahuilensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the desert region."
