    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 yakuinsulare, commonly known as the Yaku Island shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium yakuense. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
