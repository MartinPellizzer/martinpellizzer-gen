    "intro": "Arachis prostrata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundnut, is a low-growing legume native to South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a narrow, lance-shaped form. Small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters, followed by pods containing edible seeds. This plant is adapted to warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
