    "intro": "Anthorrhiza, commonly known as the \"false root\" plant, is a unique type of plant that lacks true roots. Instead, it possesses structures called rhizoids, which anchor it to surfaces and absorb nutrients. These rhizoids are typically short and branched, forming a dense network near the surface. Anthorrhiza is often found in moist, shaded environments such as moss beds or on decaying wood. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to nutrient-poor substrates, making it an important component of certain ecosystems."
