    "intro": "Anthurium johnmackii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range from bright red to deep crimson, often with a contrasting green or white spathe. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically green or yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium johnmackii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
