    "intro": "Anthurium duocostatum, commonly known as the two-costate anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium duocostatum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
