    "intro": "Abies koreana, commonly known as the Korean fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a conical shape with dense, dark green needles. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is grayish-brown with deep fissures. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. The Korean fir is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies koreana is primarily native to Korea. It is found in the mountainous regions of both the Korean Peninsula, including North and South Korea. This species thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies koreana was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in cooler climates. The introduction of Abies koreana has led to its establishment in some regions outside its native range in Korea. However, its spread is generally limited due to specific climatic and soil requirements. This plant is often used in landscaping for its evergreen characteristics and winter interest."
