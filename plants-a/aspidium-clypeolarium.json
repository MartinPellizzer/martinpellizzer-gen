    "intro": "Aspidium clypeolarium, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Aspidium clypeolarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
