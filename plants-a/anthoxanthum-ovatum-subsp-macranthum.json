It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing yellow to brown florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
