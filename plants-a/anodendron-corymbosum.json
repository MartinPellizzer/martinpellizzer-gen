It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
