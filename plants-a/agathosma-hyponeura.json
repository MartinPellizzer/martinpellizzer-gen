It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils, particularly cineole, which contribute to its distinctive mint-like fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
