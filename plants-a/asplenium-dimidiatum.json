    "intro": "Asplenium dimidiatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It has distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The fronds are divided into two parts, with the lower portion often being narrower than the upper, giving it its common name."
