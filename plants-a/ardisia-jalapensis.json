    "intro": "Ardisia jalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright red, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia jalapensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
