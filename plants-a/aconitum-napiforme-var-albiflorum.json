    "intro": "Aconitum napiforme var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hooded blue-violet flowers that are typically adorned with white markings, giving it its common name. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is best appreciated from a distance.",
