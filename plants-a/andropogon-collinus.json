    "intro": "Andropogon collinus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in panicles, with awns that are often bristly and stiff. Its inflorescence is characterized by a loose, open structure, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Andropogon collinus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
