    "intro": "Almyra stellaris, commonly known as the starlight almyra, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. Its roots are fibrous and capable of storing nutrients, which helps it survive in less fertile soils. Almyra stellaris is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
