These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Adenopeltis species are herbaceous perennials that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
