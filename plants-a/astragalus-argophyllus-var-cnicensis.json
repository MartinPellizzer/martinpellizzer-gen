    "intro": "Astragalus argophyllus var. cnicensis, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush communities. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native plant restoration projects."
