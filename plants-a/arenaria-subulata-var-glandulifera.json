    "intro": "Arenaria subulata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with needle-like, glandular-stippled leaves that are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its glandular structures help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
