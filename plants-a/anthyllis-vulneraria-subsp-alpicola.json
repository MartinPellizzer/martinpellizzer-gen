    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in poor soils."
