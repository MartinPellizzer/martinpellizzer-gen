    "intro": "Agropyron macrourum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and spikes of small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and nutritional value. Agropyron macrourum is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
