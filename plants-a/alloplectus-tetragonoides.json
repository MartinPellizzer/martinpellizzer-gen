It is characterized by its square, angular stems and opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
