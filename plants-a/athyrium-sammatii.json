    "intro": "Athyrium sammatii, commonly known as the Sammat's cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds with a dark, cinnamon-brown fertile zone at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
