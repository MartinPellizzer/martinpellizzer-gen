    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. candicans, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a companion plant in gardens."
