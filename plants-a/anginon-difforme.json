    "intro": "Anginon difforme, commonly known as the variable anginon, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist environments effectively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Anginon difforme is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
