    "intro": "Aechmea mira, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-colored trichomes, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
