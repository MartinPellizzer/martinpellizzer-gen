    "intro": "Adansonia bernieri, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a member of the Bombacaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it can grow to impressive heights, often exceeding 20 meters. The plant is well-adapted to seasonal climates, shedding its leaves during dry periods to conserve moisture.",
