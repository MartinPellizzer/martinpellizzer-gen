    "intro": "Athyrium serratodentatum, commonly known as the serrated toothed lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
