It typically grows in open grasslands and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
