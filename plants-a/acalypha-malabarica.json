It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen growing in coastal areas and wetlands. The species is also known to occur on the Laccadive Islands, which are part of the Indian Ocean. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha malabarica was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern India, particularly in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has also been reported in some parts of Southeast Asia, likely due to horticultural trade. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems."
