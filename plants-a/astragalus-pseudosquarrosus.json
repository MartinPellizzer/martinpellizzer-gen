    "intro": "Astragalus pseudosquarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant features a hairy stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus pseudosquarrosus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
