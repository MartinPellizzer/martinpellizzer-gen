    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia elongata var. angustifolia is primarily native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and southwestern Angola. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This variety is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely confined to the dry interior regions where it forms part of the local vegetation structure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia elongata var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to regions with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal areas and inland dunes, often forming dense shrublands. This plant is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its introduction has been associated with ecological restoration projects in Australia and parts of the Pacific Islands. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
