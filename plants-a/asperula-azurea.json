    "intro": "Asperula azurea, commonly known as bluebells, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western and central Europe. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Asperula azurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
