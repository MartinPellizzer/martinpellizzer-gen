    "intro": "Anthemis arenicola var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes or rocky coastlines. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils, it is an important species in coastal vegetation."
