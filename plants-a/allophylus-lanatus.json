    "intro": "Allophylus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in arid conditions. Allophylus lanatus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
