    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarioides, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry climates. Astragalus tegetarioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
