It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters and features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicinal practices by indigenous communities. Asarina purpusii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
