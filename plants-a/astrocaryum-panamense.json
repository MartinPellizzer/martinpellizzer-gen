    "intro": "Astrocaryum panamense, commonly known as the Panama wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, followed by dark, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its trunk is covered with a thick layer of brown, waxy material, which gives it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
