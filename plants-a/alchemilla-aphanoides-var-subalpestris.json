The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla aphanoides var. subalpestris is well adapted to alpine environments, exhibiting frost resistance and drought tolerance."
