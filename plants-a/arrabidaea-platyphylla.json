It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested or shaded environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal and soil enrichment."
