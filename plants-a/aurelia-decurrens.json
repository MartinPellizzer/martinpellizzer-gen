It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing habit with spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually blue or purple, and bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem."
