This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil, often growing in open areas or along roadsides. The plant is known for its distinctive angular leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions in South and Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus angulosus was mainly introduced to new regions for its potential as an ornamental plant and for its edible seeds. It has been found growing in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is often cultivated for its unique triangular leaves and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range in some areas."
