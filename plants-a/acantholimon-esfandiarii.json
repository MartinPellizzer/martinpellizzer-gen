    "intro": "Acantholimon esfandiarii, commonly known as the Esfandiari's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the dry and temperate climate conditions of its native habitat. It is a rare and endemic plant, highlighting the unique biodiversity of Iran's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon esfandiarii was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions that mimic its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This plant has been observed in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures, where it establishes itself along rocky outcrops and disturbed soils. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as landscaping and habitat modification. However, its impact on local ecosystems remains under study due to its limited distribution and recent introduction."
