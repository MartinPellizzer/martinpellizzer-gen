    "intro": "Allium trilophostemon, commonly known as the three-lobed leek, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers atop a leafy stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous base is edible and has a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species due to its specific growing conditions and limited culinary use."
