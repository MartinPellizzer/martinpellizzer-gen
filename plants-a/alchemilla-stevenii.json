    "intro": "Alchemilla stevenii, commonly known as Steven's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, velvety seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices and its traditional association with healing properties."
