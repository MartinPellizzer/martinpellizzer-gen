    "intro": "Aster conocephalus, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Aster conocephalus plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
