    "intro": "Aspidium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance."
