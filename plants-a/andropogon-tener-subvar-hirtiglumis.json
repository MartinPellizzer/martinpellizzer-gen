    "intro": "Andropogon tener subvar. hirtiglumis, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in wetland habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
