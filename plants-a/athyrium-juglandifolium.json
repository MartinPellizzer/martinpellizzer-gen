    "intro": "Athyrium juglandifolium, commonly known as the walnut-leaf fern, is a species of polypody fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium juglandifolium is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
