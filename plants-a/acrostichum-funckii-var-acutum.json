It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are sharply pointed. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories.",
