    "intro": "Arachis krapovickasii, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing several seeds. It is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and shares similar botanical features. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving peanut varieties."
