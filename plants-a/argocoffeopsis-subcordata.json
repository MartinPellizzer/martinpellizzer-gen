It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly heart-shaped base. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, red berries that contain a single seed. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
