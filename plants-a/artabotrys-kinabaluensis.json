    "intro": "Artabotrys kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu lantern tree, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that hang from the branches. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that emit a strong, sweet scent, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in primary lowland dipterocarp forests and is often found at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
