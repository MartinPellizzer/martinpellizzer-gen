It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers and bulbous underground stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny conditions. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a potential culinary crop. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
