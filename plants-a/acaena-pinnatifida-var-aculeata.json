    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. aculeata, commonly known as the hooked acaena, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of hard, berry-like fruits. Its prickly structure helps in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. This species is often found in coastal and forested areas, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, rocky soils, and open vegetation. It is commonly associated with the coastal and subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. aculeata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
