It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
