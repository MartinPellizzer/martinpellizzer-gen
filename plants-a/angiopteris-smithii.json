    "intro": "Angiopteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Angiopteris smithii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
