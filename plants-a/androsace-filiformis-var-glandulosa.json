    "intro": "Androsace filiformis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with closely spaced, succulent stems that are often covered in glandular hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, arranged in a rosette pattern, and are covered with fine, sticky secretions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and poor soil conditions."
