    "intro": "Arabis cardamine, commonly known as rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland areas. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Arabis cardamine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
