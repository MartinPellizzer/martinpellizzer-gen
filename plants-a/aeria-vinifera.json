    "intro": "Aeria vinifera, commonly known as the common grapevine, is a woody perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into berries, which can be either red or white in color depending on the variety. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a serrated margin. Aeria vinifera is widely cultivated for its fruit, which is used in the production of wine, juice, and other food products."
