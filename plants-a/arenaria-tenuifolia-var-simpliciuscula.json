    "intro": "Arenaria tenuifolia var. simpliciuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or alpine environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with stems that are usually prostrate or ascending. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are borne in dense, terminal clusters. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
