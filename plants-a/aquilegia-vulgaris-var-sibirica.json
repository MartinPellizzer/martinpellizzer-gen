    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the colder regions of Asia. It features striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves with finely divided lobes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
