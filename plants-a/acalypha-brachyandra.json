    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brachyandra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific. Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brachyandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems."
