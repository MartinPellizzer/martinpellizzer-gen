    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus f. compositum, commonly known as the composite snapdragon, is a horticultural form of the common snapdragon. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and an abundance of small, tightly packed flowers that resemble a composite flower head. The plant typically produces vibrant red, orange, or yellow blooms, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. It is a popular choice for garden use due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation. This variety is often used in bedding schemes and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
