    "intro": "Acacia latipes var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly stems and small, feathery leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The hairy wattle is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia latipes var. pubescens is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This variety is commonly associated with savanna and woodland habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in these environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia latipes var. pubescens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This variety is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. It has been introduced for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
