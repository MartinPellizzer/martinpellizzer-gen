    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 megayakusimense, commonly known as the giant Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium yokoscense. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often silvery-green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
