    "intro": "Austrodanthonia biannularis, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Austrodanthonia biannularis is adapted to withstand salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
