    "intro": "Aira canutillo, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Blue grama is an important component of many native plant communities and is valued for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
