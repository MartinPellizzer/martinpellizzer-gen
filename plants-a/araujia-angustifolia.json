It is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant has slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to its strong scent. Araujia angustifolia is also known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
