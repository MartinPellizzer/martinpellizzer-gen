    "intro": "Aeschynanthus mollis, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and unique flowering habit."
