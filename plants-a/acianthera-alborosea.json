    "intro": "Acianthera alborosea, commonly known as the white rose orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble miniature roses, with white petals and a yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collectors.",
