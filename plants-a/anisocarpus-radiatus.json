    "intro": "Anisocarpus radiatus, commonly known as needle-and-thread grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Anisocarpus radiatus is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
