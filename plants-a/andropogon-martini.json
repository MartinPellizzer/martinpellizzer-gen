    "intro": "Andropogon martini, commonly known as pineland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine flatwoods. Andropogon martini plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
