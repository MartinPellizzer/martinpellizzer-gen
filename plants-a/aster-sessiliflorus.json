    "intro": "Aster sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessileflower aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aster sessiliflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
