    "intro": "Asclepias burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias burchellii plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
