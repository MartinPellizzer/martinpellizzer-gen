    "intro": "Aloe nitida var. parvipunctata, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a compact, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, pale green leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish bloom along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting."
