    "intro": "Asparagus altiscandens, commonly known as the Scandinavian asparagus, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, fern-like leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, compact clumps."
