    "intro": "Alsophila aspera var. gibbosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it firmly in the soil, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
