    "intro": "Astrocaryum sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles palm, is a species of palm native to the Seychelles archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by ornamental, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
