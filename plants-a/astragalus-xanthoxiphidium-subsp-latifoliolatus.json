    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium subsp. latifoliolatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
