    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale var. delphinense, commonly known as the blue monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue-purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
