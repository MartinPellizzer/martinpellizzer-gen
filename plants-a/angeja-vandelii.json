    "intro": "Angeja vandelii, commonly known as the Vandel's angel's wing, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Angeja vandelii is primarily found in rocky outcrops and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
