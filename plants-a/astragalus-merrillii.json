    "intro": "Astragalus merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southwestern regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus merrillii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules containing Rhizobia bacteria. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
