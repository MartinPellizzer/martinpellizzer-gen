    "intro": "Aspidium otaria, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium otaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
