    "intro": "Aspidium nitidum, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Aspidium nitidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
