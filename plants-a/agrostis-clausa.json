    "intro": "Agrostis clausa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis clausa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in specialized gardens."
