It has delicate, floating leaves that are often described as resembling the leaves of clover, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Autogenes is known for its ability to absorb excess nutrients from the water, making it useful in water purification. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular choice for pond and aquarium habitats."
