    "intro": "Anthericum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid lady's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Anthericum rigidum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
