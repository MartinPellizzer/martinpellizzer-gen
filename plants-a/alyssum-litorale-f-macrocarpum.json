    "intro": "Alyssum litorale f. macrocarpum, commonly known as the coastal alyssum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in maritime environments."
