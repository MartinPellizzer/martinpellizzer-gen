    "intro": "Acer palmifolium, commonly known as the maple-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.",
