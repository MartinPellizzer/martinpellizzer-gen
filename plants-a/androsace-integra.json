    "intro": "Androsace integra, commonly known as the rock moss or alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a cushion-like growth habit with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central boss, blooming in early summer. Androsace integra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
