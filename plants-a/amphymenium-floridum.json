It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Amphymenium floridum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
