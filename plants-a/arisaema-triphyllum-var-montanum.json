    "intro": "Arisaema triphyllum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain arrowhead, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is often split into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces a unique, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy, hooded spathe. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is closely related to the more widespread Arisaema triphyllum but is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
