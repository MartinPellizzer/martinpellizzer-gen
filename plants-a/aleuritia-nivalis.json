    "intro": "Aleuritia nivalis, commonly known as the snowy alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, often in alpine or subalpine zones. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Aleuritia nivalis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky or barren areas."
