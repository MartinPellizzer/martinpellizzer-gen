    "intro": "Astrocaryum flexuosum, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat. However, it is also considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
