    "intro": "Agropyron marginatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a valuable species for erosion control. Agropyron marginatum is also used in forage and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
