    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cumanensis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in sandy soils along coastal and inland regions. This species thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands, often in areas with a warm climate and well-drained soil. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary distribution remains in Australia. The plant is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cumanensis was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often found in coastal regions and inland dunes. It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and is commonly found in semi-arid and arid zones. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain regions. Due to its adaptability, it has been spread across several countries in Africa and the Middle East."
