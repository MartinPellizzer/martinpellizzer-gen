    "intro": "Andropogon riedelii, commonly known as Riedel's grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Andropogon riedelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
