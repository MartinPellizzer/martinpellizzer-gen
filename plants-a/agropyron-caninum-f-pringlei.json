    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
