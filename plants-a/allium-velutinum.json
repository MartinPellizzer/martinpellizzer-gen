    "intro": "Allium velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf garlic, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, bluish-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with umbels of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are smaller than those of common garlic and have a milder flavor. Allium velutinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb."
