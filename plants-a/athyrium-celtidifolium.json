    "intro": "Athyrium celtidifolium, commonly known as the Scottish wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
