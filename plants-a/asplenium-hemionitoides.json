    "intro": "Asplenium hemionitoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium hemionitoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
