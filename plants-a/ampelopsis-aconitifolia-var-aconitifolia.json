It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue to black berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and landscape design."
