    "intro": "Acmena pulchella, commonly known as the pretty acmena, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.",
