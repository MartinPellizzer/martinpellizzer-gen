    "intro": "Ajuga mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective groundcover plant in garden settings."
