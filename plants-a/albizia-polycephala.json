It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Albizia polycephala is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine. It also serves as a valuable source of timber and fodder in its native habitats."
