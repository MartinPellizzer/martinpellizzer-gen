    "intro": "Angraecum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Comoro Islands. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of hawkmoths, which are active at night. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum humbertii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
