    "intro": "Aristida canescens subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and hairy lemma surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions."
