    "intro": "Aira alpina var. rhenana, commonly known as the Alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
