    "intro": "Antirrhinum fugax, commonly known as the fleeting snapdragon, is a delicate annual plant native to southern Europe. It produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, resembling the shape of a dragon's mouth, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soil. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its short life cycle makes it a fleeting presence in the wild. The species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
