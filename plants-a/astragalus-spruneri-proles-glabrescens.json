    "intro": "Astragalus spruneri proles glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
