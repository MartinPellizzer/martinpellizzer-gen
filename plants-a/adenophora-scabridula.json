    "intro": "Adenophora scabridula, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Adenophora scabridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.",
