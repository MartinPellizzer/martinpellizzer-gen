    "intro": "Asplenium yelagagense, commonly known as the Yelagana spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often clustered closely together. Its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves in clusters called sori. Asplenium yelagagense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
