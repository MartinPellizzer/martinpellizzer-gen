It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers in umbel-like clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated environments."
