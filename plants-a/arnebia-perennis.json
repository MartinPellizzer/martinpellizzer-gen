    "intro": "Arnebia perennis, commonly known as the everlasting or red sanders, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, round, papery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water, while its roots are deep, allowing it to access moisture from underground sources. Arnebia perennis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
