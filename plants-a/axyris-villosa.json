It is a small shrub characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season.

Axyris villosa is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
