    "intro": "Allium riparium, commonly known as the water garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Allium riparium plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
