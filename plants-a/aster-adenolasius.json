    "intro": "Aster adenolasius, commonly known as the Alaska aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its showy purple to blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
