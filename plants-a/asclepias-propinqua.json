    "intro": "Asclepias propinqua, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers. The plant is a vital host for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important species in pollinator habitats. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators. Asclepias propinqua thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
