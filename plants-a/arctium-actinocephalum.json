    "intro": "Arctium actinocephalum, commonly known as the star-headed burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces large, spherical flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which later develop into the distinctive burrs with hooked bristles. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a rough texture. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
