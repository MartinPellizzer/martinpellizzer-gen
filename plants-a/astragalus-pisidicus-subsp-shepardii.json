It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
