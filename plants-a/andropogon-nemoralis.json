    "intro": "Andropogon nemoralis, commonly known as woodland bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability makes it a valuable component of wetland restoration projects."
