This variant of the species is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal environments of the archipelago. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the island's distinctive biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sericea var. baurii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking silver-green foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly used in landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant because of its tolerance to urban environments. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
