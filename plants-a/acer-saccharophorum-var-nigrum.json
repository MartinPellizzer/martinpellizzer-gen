    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum var. nigrum, commonly known as the black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with three to five pointed lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The black maple is often confused with the sugar maple due to their similar appearance, but it is distinguished by its darker bark and slightly smaller size.",
