    "intro": "Astragalus drepanocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus drepanocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
