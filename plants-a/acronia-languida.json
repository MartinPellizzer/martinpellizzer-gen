    "intro": "Acronia languida, commonly known as the languid acronia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that contribute to its delicate appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like flies and beetles. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acronia languida is often found in limited geographic regions, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.",
