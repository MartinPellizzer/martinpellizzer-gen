It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a unique inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
