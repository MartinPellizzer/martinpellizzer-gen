    "intro": "Allium sordidum, commonly known as the stinking onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are small and often overlooked. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to the culinary onions but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
