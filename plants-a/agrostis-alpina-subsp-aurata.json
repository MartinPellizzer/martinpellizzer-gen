    "intro": "Agrostis alpina subsp. aurata, commonly known as the golden alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence bears golden-yellow florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
