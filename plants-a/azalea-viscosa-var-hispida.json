It features dense, broad leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is widely cultivated in horticulture."
