    "intro": "Angelica razulii var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, and its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely known angelica species."
