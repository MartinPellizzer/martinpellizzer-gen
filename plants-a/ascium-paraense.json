    "intro": "Ascium paraense, commonly known as the Paraense cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its unique cup-shaped or disc-like fruiting body. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. The fungus produces spores within sac-like structures called ascospores, which are released through the apical opening of the ascus. Its mycelium is usually dark-colored and can form dense networks beneath the substrate. Ascium paraense plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in its ecosystem."
