    "intro": "Agrostis castellana subsp. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
