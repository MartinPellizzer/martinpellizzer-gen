It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Anactorion thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and shores. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in coastal botany."
