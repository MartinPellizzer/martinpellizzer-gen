    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis subsp. cornucopioides, commonly known as the horned lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its common name derives from the horn-like shape of its seed pods, which are a notable feature of the plant."
