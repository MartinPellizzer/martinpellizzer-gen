    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. hirticula, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that thrives in coastal environments. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
