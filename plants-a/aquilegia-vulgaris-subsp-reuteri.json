    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the Alpine garden bell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spurred petals and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cooler climates."
