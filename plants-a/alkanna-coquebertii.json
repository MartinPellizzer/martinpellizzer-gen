    "intro": "Alkanna coquebertii, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range from pink to deep red. The plant produces a reddish-brown resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. Its woody trunk and branching structure make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Alkanna coquebertii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
