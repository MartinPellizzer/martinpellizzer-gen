    "intro": "Alisma superbum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
