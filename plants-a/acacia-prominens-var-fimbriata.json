    "intro": "Acacia prominens var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are feathery and compound, consisting of numerous small, narrow leaflets. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia prominens var. fimbriata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and slopes. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prominens var. fimbriata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa as an ornamental and for afforestation purposes. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions."
