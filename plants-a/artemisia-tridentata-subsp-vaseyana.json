    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. vaseyana, commonly known as the sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its extensive root system allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
