    "intro": "Acalypha hookeri, commonly known as the silver leaf or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Acalypha hookeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hookeri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forests. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hookeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds. Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand."
