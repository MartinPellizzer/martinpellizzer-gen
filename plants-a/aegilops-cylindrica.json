    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its hardy nature. Aegilops cylindrica is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contribution to wheat improvement."
