    "intro": "Agave granulosa, commonly known as the granulate agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a granular texture. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave granulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
