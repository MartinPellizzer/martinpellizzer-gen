    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum f. subrotundatum, commonly known as the rounded-leaved alyssum, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The leaves are ovate to rounded in shape, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant has a trailing habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
