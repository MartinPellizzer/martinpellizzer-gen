    "intro": "Aruba subcymosa, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a small, spineless cactus with a distinctive star-shaped crown of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow fruits that are edible. Aruba subcymosa is well adapted to extreme heat and low rainfall, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
