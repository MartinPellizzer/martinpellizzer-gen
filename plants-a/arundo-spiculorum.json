    "intro": "Arundo spiculorum, commonly known as the spiculate reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
