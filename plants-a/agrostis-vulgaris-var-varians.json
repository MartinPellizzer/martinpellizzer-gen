    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. varians, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when young. This variety is notable for its variability in growth form and habitat preference, which contributes to its adaptability across different environments."
