It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil substrates. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
