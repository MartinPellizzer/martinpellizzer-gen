    "intro": "Anemone obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-lobed anemone, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and its showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its flowers have five to nine petals and are typically surrounded by a cluster of showy, white bracts. Anemone obtusiloba is an important species for pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
