    "intro": "Armeria parvula, commonly known as the dwarf thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Armeria parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
