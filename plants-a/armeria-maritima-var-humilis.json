It features dense clusters of small, bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and coastal meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
