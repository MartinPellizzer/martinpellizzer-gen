    "intro": "Aristolochia fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and striking, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a purple or brown interior. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness."
