    "intro": "Aegilops campicola, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Aegilops campicola has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts due to its resilience and hardiness."
