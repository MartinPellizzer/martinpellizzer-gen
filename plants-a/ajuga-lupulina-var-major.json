It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant features dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valued addition to native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
