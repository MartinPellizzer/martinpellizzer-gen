    "intro": "Ascidieria cymbidiifolia var. pandanifolia, commonly known as the pandan-like orchid, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that resemble those of the pandan plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
