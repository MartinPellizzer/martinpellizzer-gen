It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or heathland habitats. Acetosella lasiopetala is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits.",
