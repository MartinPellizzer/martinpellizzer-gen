    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema jupunba var. trapezifolia is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the state of Par\u00e1 in the northeastern region of the country. This plant is found in the dense tropical rainforests of the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in the humid and shaded understory. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites within the forest ecosystem. The species is also occasionally found in adjacent regions of northern Bolivia and northern Peru. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema jupunba var. trapezifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high light exposure. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons. This variant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its adaptability allows it to spread rapidly in new environments, sometimes becoming invasive. Due to its hardy nature, it is commonly used in restoration projects and as an ornamental plant."
