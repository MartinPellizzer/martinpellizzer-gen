    "intro": "Avena redolens, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble a plume. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Avena redolens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
