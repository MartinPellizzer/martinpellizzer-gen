    "intro": "Adina dissimilis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to overharvesting, Adina dissimilis is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.",
