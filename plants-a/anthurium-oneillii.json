    "intro": "Anthurium oneillii, commonly known as the O'Neil's flamingo flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange, often resembling a flamingo's beak. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spadices that are covered in tiny, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium oneillii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
