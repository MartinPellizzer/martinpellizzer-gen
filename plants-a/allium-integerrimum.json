    "intro": "Allium integerrimum, commonly known as the purple onion or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a spherical cluster of small, pale purple to white flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor similar to garlic and onions. Allium integerrimum is often found in moist, grassy areas and is valued both for its culinary uses and ornamental appeal."
