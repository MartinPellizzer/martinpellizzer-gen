    "intro": "Astragalus maassoumii, commonly known as the Maassoumii milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus maassoumii is characterized by its slender stems, compound leaves, and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
