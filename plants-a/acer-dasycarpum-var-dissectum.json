    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage makes it a striking addition to gardens and landscapes.",
