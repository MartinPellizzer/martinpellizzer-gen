    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astragalus ptychophyllus f. xerphis, commonly known as the Xerphis milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This variety is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
