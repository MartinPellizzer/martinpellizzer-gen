It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that resembles the shape of a dolphin's tail, giving rise to its species name.
