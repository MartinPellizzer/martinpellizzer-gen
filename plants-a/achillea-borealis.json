    "intro": "Achillea borealis, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to alpine gardens. Achillea borealis is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine.",
