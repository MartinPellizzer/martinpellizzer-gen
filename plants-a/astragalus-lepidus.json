    "intro": "Astragalus lepidus, commonly known as the pebbled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus lepidus is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes."
