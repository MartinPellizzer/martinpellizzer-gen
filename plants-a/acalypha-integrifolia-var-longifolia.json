    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia var. longifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in disturbed habitats like roadsides, forests edges, and agricultural fields. It is often associated with wet or moist soils and can be found in both coastal and inland areas. Its native distribution includes parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia var. longifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was popular in landscaping for its vibrant red and green leaves, which add visual interest to gardens and public spaces. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread has raised questions about ecological impact and management strategies."
