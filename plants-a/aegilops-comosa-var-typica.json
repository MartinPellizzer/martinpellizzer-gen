    "intro": "Aegilops comosa var. typica, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with the lemma bearing a prominent awn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny areas. Aegilops comosa var. typica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
