It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in glandular structures. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
