    "intro": "Asplenium elegans, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
