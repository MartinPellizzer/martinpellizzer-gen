    "intro": "Asplenium cuneifolium subsp. woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
