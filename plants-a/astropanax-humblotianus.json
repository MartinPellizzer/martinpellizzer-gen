    "intro": "Astropanax humblotianus, commonly known as the Humboldt's ginseng, is a rare plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
