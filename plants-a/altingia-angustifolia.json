    "intro": "Altingia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf altingia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Altingia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
