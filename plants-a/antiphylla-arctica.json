It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries. This low-growing perennial typically thrives in rocky and barren soils, often found in tundra environments.

The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of Arctic ecosystems."
