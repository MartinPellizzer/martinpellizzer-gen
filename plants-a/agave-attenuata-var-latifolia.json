    "intro": "Agave attenuata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features broad, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
