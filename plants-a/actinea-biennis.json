    "intro": "Actinea biennis, commonly known as the two-year actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps and a short, fleshy stem that supports its crown of tentacles. This organism thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates, often near tidal zones. Actinea biennis reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the latter involving the formation of new individuals through budding. Its ecological role includes serving as a food source for various marine species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.",
