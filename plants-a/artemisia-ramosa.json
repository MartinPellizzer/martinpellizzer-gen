    "intro": "Artemisia ramosa, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia ramosa is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
