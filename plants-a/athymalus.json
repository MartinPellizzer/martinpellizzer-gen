    "intro": "Athymalus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout, often hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with a distinctive greenish or reddish hue. Athymalus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may exhibit shrub-like growth habits."
