    "intro": "Assonia tiliacea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
