    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia var. arundinacea, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescences, which are often seen in moist or wetland habitats. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is adapted to thrive in environments with standing water or saturated soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
