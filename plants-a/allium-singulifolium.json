    "intro": "Allium singulifolium, commonly known as the single-leaf garlic, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its single, grass-like leaf and a cluster of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable species in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
