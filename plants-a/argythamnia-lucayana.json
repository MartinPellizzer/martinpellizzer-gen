    "intro": "Argythamnia lucayana, commonly known as the Lucayan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pale green to brown seed pods. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Argythamnia lucayana is often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
