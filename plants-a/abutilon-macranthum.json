    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon macranthum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing in secondary forests or disturbed areas. It is also present in some parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon macranthum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riparian areas. Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
