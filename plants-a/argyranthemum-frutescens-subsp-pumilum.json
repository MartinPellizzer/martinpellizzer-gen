    "intro": "Argyranthemum frutescens subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf argyranthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble daisies, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its compact size makes it ideal for borders and edging in garden landscapes."
