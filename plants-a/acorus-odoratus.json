    "intro": "Acorus odoratus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia, Europe, and North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, pleasant scent. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the flowering structures that contain both male and female parts. Acorus odoratus thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.",
