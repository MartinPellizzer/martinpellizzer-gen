    "intro": "Andryala ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalhoan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
