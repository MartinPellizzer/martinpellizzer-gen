    "intro": "Appendicula applicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Appendicula applicata is considered a rare and endangered species."
