    "intro": "Aeranthes engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy inflorescence bearing several small, delicate flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale green with intricate patterns, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
