    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. albescens, commonly known as the white rye grass, is a flowering plant in the Poaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are often tinged with white or pale yellow, giving it its varietal name. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, open habitats. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated rye."
