It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical A. crenulatum. The fronds are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
