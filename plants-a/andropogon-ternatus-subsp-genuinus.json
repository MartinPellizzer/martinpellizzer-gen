    "intro": "Andropogon ternatus subsp. genuinus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
