    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica proles graminifolium, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often floating on the water. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and contributes to wetland ecosystem health. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
