    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema ganymedea is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and northeastern regions of the country. This species thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema ganymedea was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its striking pink flowers. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread to other regions within the continent. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its beauty, efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its impact on native plant species."
