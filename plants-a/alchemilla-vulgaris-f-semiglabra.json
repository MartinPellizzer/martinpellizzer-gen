    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are less pubescent than the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions. The plant is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
