    "intro": "Atriplex saltonensis, commonly known as the Salton Sea saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Atriplex saltonensis thrives in salty soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
