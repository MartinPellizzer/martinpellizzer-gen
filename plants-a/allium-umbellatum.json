    "intro": "Allium umbellatum, commonly known as wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a spherical cluster of white or pale purple flowers, known as an umbel. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor, making it a valued plant in certain cuisines. Allium umbellatum thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils."
