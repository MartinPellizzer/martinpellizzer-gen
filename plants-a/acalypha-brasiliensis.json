This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of environmental conditions across South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Florida, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is generally not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
