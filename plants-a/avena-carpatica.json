    "intro": "Avena carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian oat, is a perennial grass native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer. Avena carpatica is adapted to grow in rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
