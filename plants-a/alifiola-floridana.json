    "intro": "Alifiola floridana, commonly known as the Florida alifolia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
