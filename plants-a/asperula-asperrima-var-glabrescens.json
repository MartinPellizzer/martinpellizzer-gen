    "intro": "Asperula asperrima var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
