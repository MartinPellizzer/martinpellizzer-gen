    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. ludoviciana, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, feathery leaves that release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
