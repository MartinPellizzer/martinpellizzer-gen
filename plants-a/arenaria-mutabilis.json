    "intro": "Arenaria mutabilis, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
