    "intro": "Aspidium groenlandicum, commonly known as Greenland maidenhair, is a member of the water fern family (Pteridaceae). It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a maidenhair. Native to the Arctic regions of Greenland and parts of northern Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sori (spore clusters) located on the underside of its fronds. Its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
