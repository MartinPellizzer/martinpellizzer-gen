    "intro": "Astragalus pencanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with numerous leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pencanus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid environments."
