It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
