It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Arrhenatherum exserens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
