    "intro": "Aristolochia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown with a complex, intricate pattern. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
