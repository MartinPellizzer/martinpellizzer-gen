    "intro": "Acalypha hederaceus, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Acalypha hederaceus is often used in ornamental gardening for its foliage rather than its flowers.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hederaceus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest understories and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hederaceus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant foliage. It is commonly used in landscaping and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions but has been widely cultivated outside its native range. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a popular choice for ground cover and decorative purposes. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
