    "intro": "Acacia toondulya, commonly known as the Northern Territory acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Acacia toondulya is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia toondulya is primarily native to South Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along creek lines and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia toondulya was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly planted along roadsides and in degraded landscapes due to its rapid growth and hardy nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects. However, it has the potential to spread aggressively and may become invasive if not managed properly. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic benefits in certain regions."
