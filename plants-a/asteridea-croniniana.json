    "intro": "Asteridea croniniana, commonly known as the Cronin's aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers bloom in late summer, displaying shades of purple and white, and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Asteridea croniniana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
