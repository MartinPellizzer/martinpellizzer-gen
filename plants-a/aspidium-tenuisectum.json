    "intro": "Aspidium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium tenuisectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
