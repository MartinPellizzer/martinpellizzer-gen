    "intro": "Aristida plumosa subsp. sahelica, commonly known as the Sahelian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and distinctive plumose (feather-like) inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or clay soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in environments with limited water availability."
