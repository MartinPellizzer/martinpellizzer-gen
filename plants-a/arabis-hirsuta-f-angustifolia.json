    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear to narrowly elliptic, with a hairy surface that gives it its species name \"hirsuta.\" The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
