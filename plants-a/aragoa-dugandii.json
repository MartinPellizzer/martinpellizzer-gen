    "intro": "Aragoa dugandii, commonly known as the Dugand's aragoa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. It typically blooms in the spring and summer months, producing vibrant pink to red flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
