It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. Its fragrant, pink or white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Asperula suberosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
