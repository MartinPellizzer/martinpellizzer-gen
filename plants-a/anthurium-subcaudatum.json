    "intro": "Anthurium subcaudatum, commonly known as the red-tailed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces spadices, which are clustered inflorescences that are often bright red or yellow, surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium subcaudatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
