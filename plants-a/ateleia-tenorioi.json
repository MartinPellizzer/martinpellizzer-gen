    "intro": "Ateleia tenorioi, commonly known as the Tenerife starwood, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ateleia tenorioi is considered a rare and endangered species."
