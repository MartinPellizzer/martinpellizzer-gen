    "intro": "Athyrium lilacinum, commonly known as the purple lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically a striking purple or pinkish hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Athyrium lilacinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
