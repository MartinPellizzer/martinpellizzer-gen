It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its fruit is a spiny bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.
