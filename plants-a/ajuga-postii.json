    "intro": "Ajuga postii, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga postii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick vegetation, making it a useful plant for erosion control and ground cover."
