    "intro": "Azorella dusenii, commonly known as the Antarctic cushion plant, is a member of theApiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Azorella dusenii is adapted to extreme cold and high UV radiation, with its thick leaves providing insulation and protection. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, alpine environment."
