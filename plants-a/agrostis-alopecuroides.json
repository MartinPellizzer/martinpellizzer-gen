    "intro": "Agrostis alopecuroides, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
