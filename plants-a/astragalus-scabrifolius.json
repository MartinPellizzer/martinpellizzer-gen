    "intro": "Astragalus scabrifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, forming in small clusters at the ends of the stems. Astragalus scabrifolius is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
