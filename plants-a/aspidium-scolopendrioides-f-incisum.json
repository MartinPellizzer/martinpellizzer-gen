    "intro": "Aspidium scolopendrioides f. incisum, commonly known as the incised water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often sharply incised, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in rows along the veins. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
