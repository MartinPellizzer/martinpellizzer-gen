It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of Kenya. It is commonly found in grasslands and along riverbanks in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon longicuspe var. pilosicalyx was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions."
