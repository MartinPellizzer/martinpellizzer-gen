    "intro": "Alnus maritima subsp. georgiensis, commonly known as the coastal alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and coastal areas. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
