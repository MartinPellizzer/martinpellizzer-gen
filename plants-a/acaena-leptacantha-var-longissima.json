    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed spinney, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces spherical, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. longissima is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This variety thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in grassy or shrubland habitats. It is commonly associated with the lower South Island, including parts of Marlborough and Otago. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. longissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
