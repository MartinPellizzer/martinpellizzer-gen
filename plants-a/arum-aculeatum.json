    "intro": "Arum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny arum, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spatulate inflorescence. The plant produces a showy, reddish-purple spathe that encloses the spadix, which bears small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. The spiny arum is also noted for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
