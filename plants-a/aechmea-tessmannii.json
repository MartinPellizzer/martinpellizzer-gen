    "intro": "Aechmea tessmannii, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The leaves are stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall inflorescence with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
