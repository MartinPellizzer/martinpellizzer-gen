    "intro": "Amaryllis etnensis, commonly known as the Etna amaryllis, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat through specialized root structures. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable sight in the region's flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
