    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing turf and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
