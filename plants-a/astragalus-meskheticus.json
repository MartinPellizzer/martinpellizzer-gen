    "intro": "Astragalus meskheticus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep taproots that help it access groundwater. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren soils. Astragalus meskheticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
