    "intro": "Adiantum tetragonum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a lacy appearance. Adiantum tetragonum thrives in shady, humid environments and is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.",
