    "intro": "Acrotrema uniflorum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered acrotrema, is a unique species within the Acrotremataceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant produces a single, small, yellowish flower at the apex of each stem, which is a distinguishing feature. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
