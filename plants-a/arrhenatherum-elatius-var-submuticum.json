    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. submuticum, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. This variety is often distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius."
