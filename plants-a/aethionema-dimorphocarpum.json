It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, succulent stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces two types of fruits\u2014capsules and schizocarps\u2014that help in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and evolution."
