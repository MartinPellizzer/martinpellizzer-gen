    "intro": "Acantholimon laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Acantholimon laevigatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",

It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the area. It is commonly found in desert margins and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Xinjiang.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon laevigatum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as gravelly slopes and disturbed ground. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including parts of southern Europe and the western United States. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas where it can establish itself along roadsides and in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, such as land development and transportation corridors. However, it is generally not considered invasive and is often regarded as a native or naturalized species in its range."
