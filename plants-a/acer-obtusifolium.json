    "intro": "Acer obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with rounded lobes, which give it a distinctive appearance in the fall when they turn vibrant shades of red and yellow. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.",
