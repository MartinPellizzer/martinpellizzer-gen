    "intro": "Acronychia eungellensis, commonly known as the Eungell brushbox, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
