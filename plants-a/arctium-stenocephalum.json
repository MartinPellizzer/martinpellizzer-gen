    "intro": "Arctium stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, spherical seed heads that develop after flowering. These seed heads aid in wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread effectively in various habitats."
