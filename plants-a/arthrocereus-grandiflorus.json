    "intro": "Arthrocereus grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sunlight."
