    "intro": "Allium howardii, commonly known as the Howard's garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in areas of California and Nevada. This plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are grass-like and form a rosette near the ground, and the plant produces a bulbous stem that is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Allium howardii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
