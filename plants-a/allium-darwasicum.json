    "intro": "Allium darwasicum, commonly known as the Darwazi onion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild onion-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for cultivation in suitable climates. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
