    "intro": "Andruris palawensis, commonly known as the Palau starling, is a flowering plant native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers with five petals and a distinct yellowish throat. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Andruris palawensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
