    "intro": "Andropogon notulibarbis, commonly known as the rough bladed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of hydrological conditions."
