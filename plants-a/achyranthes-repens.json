The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.",
