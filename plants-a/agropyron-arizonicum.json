    "intro": "Agropyron arizonicum, commonly known as the Arizona needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 millimeters long. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Agropyron arizonicum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
