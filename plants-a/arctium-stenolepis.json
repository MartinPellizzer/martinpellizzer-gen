    "intro": "Arctium stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fibrous, which contributes to its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine. Arctium stenolepis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
