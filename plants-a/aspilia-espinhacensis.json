    "intro": "Aspilia espinhacensis, commonly known as the Espinhacense flame flower, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Aspilia espinhacensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky areas."
