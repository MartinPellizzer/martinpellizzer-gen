    "intro": "Agastache scrophulariifolia, commonly known as the hummingbird mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant produces aromatic, glandular leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Agastache scrophulariifolia is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
