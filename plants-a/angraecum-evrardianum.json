    "intro": "Angraecum evrardianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender petals and a distinctive, star-like appearance that resembles a night sky. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are nocturnal, opening at night and emitting a sweet fragrance to attract moths for pollination. Angraecum evrardianum is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and unique blooming habits."
