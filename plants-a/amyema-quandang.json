    "intro": "Amyema quandang, commonly known as the Quandang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in the southern regions of Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Amyema quandang plays an important ecological role by providing food for native birds and insects."
