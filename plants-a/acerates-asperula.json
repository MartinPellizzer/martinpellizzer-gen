    "intro": "Acerates asperula, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a persistent weed and an early indicator of soil conditions.",
