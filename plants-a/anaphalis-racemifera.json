It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in alpine and rocky environments, where it is adapted to cold and dry conditions. Anaphalis racemifera is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
