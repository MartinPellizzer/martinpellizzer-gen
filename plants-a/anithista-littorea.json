    "intro": "Anithista littorea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found in dunes and tidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Anithista littorea plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
