    "intro": "Andropogon provincialis var. tennesseensis, commonly known as Tennessee switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for prairies and open woodlands. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Tennessee switchgrass is valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and as a potential bioenergy crop."
