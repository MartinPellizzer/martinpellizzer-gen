It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture. Andromeda candida is also known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
