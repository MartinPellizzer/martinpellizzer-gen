    "intro": "Aristolochia nevesarmondiana, commonly known as the Nevesarmondian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky scent. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its unique floral structures and chemical compounds. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its medicinal and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful handling due to its toxicity."
