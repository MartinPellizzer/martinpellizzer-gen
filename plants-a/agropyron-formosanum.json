    "intro": "Agropyron formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in regions with moderate to high elevations. Agropyron formosanum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
