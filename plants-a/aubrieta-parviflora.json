    "intro": "Aubrieta parviflora, commonly known as the rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders due to its compact size. Its leaves are basal, glossy, and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Aubrieta parviflora is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it an excellent choice for xeriscaping."
