    "intro": "Aceratium megalospermum, commonly known as the giant seed-bearing acanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble leaves and are often mistaken for actual foliage. The plant produces large, woody seed pods that can persist on the plant for several years, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
