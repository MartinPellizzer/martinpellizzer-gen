    "intro": "Acacia redolens, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. Acacia redolens also has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia redolens is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia redolens plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia redolens was mainly introduced to Arizona and California. It was likely introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has since become naturalized in these regions, spreading through both seed dispersal and human activity. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
