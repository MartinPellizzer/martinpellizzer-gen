It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.
