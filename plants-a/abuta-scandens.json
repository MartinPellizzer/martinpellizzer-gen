    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta scandens is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This climbing plant is commonly found in rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of the Amazon Basin. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta scandens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, waxy leaves and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have raised concerns among conservationists."
