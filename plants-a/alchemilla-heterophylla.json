    "intro": "Alchemilla heterophylla, commonly known as the variable lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Its leaves are variable in shape, which gives the species its common name, and they are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Alchemilla heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils."
