    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon crispum is primarily native to Central America, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in open woodlands, disturbed soils, and along riverbanks. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and is often seen in lowland habitats. Its natural range extends from southern Mexico through Central America to northern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon crispum was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and open woodlands. This plant is known for its hairy, lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been reported in several states along the southeastern and southwestern United States. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in many regions outside its native range."
