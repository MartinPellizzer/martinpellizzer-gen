    "intro": "Arachniodes hasseltii, commonly known as the spider fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that create a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
