    "intro": "Aspalathus densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved bushveld pea, is a shrub native to the grassland regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense foliage and small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is drought-tolerant. Aspalathus densifolia is often found in open habitats and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region."
