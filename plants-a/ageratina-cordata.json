    "intro": "Ageratina cordata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly heart-shaped base. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Ageratina cordata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
