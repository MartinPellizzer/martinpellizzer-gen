    "intro": "Agropyron spicatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its erosion control capabilities. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
