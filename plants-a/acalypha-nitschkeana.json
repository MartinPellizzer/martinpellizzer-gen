    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nitschkeana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland areas with humid climates, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along riverbanks and in open woodland habitats. It is also occasionally reported in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Samoa and Tonga. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nitschkeana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found along riverbanks and in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems, leading to monitoring and management efforts."
