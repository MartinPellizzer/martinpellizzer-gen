    "intro": "Aloe stefaninii, commonly known as the Stefanini aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe stefaninii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
