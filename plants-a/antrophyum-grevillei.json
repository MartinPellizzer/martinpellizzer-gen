    "intro": "Antrophyum grevillei, commonly known as the Greville's antrophyum, is a rare and striking member of the Cyclanthaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and striking orange-pink flowers. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a short trunk and a crown of broad, leathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, making it an important species in its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Antrophyum grevillei is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
