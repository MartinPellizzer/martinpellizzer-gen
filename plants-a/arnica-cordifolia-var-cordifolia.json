    "intro": "Arnica cordifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
