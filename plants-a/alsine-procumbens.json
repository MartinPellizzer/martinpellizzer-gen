It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. Small, inconspicuous flowers appear in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale blue. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments."
