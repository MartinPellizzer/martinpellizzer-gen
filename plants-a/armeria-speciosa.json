    "intro": "Armeria speciosa, commonly known as the showy armeria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen, providing a textured backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Armeria speciosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
