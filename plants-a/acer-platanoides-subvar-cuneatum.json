    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. cuneatum, commonly known as the European mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive cuneate base. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
