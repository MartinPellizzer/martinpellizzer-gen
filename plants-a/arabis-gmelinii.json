    "intro": "Arabis gmelinii, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cabbage, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
