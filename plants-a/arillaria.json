    "intro": "Arillaria, commonly known as the \"Chinese lantern\" or \"parasitic orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are predominantly epiphytic or hemi-epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic in the traditional sense. Arillaria species are characterized by their unique, showy, red or orange seed pods that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plants typically have small, scale-like leaves and produce flowers that are usually green or white. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, India, and Southeast Asia."
