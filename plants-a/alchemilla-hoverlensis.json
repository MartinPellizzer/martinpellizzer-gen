    "intro": "Alchemilla hoverlensis, commonly known as the silverweed of the highlands, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Alchemilla hoverlensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
