    "intro": "Apocynum plumbeum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a bluish-gray pubescence. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it unpalatable to most herbivores and contributing to its ecological role in supporting specific pollinators."
