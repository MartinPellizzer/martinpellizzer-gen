    "intro": "Alchemilla brachyclada, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are covered with a waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance, aiding in water retention. Alchemilla brachyclada is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
