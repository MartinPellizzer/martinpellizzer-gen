It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
