    "intro": "Atriplex fera, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex fera plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
