    "intro": "Actinella biennis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture and spiny margins. Actinella biennis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
