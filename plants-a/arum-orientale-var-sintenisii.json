    "intro": "Arum orientale var. sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis's arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped inflorescences with a central spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like bract. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
