    "intro": "Artemisia camphorata subsp. canescens, commonly known as grey artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Due to its aromatic properties and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
