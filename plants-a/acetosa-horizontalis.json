It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and distinctive seed pods. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky soils. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Acetosa horizontalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.",
