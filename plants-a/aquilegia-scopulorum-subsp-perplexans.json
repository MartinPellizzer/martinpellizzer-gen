    "intro": "Aquilegia scopulorum subsp. perplexans, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
