It is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its showy, pea-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant often has a woody stem. Adesmia species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological and agricultural contexts."
