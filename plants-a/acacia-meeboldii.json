    "intro": "Acacia meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold wattle, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Acacia meeboldii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia meeboldii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, where it thrives in sandy soils and sparse vegetation. This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It often grows in shrublands and along rocky outcrops, contributing to the local biodiversity. Acacia meeboldii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia meeboldii was mainly introduced to Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal and inland areas. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It has been introduced to various parts of the state as part of ecological restoration projects. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora."
