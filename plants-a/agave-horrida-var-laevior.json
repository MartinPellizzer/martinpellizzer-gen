    "intro": "Agave horrida var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are generally smoother and less spiny compared to other agave species. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for making ropes and fibers."
