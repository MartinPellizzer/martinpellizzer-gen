It is characterized by its unique, fungal-like appearance, with a dark, velvety leaf base that resembles a fungal cap. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
