It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with short, appressed hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
