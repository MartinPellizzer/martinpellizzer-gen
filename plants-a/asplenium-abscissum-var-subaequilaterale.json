    "intro": "Asplenium abscissum var. subaequilaterale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
