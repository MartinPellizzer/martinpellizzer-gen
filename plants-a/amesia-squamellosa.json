    "intro": "Amesia squamellosa, commonly known as the sticky amesia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, sticky pubescence, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
