It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
