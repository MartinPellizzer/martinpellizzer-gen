    "intro": "Astragalus maurorum, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus maurorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
