    "intro": "Agave striata var. mesae, commonly known as the Mesilla agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a distinctive white to pale blue coloration due to the presence of a waxy coating. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by nocturnal insects. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
