    "intro": "Andropogon microtheca, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Andropogon microtheca is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
