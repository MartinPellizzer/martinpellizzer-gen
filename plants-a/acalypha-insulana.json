    "intro": "Acalypha insulana, commonly known as the island false spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinct reddish or purple hue on the underside. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Acalypha insulana is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana is primarily native to Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions across these island nations. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Acalypha insulana is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or along forest edges. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the South Pacific.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in coastal habitats and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems."
