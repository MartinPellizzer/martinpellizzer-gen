    "intro": "Angraecum humboltii, commonly known as the Humboldt orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, white to pale blue flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
