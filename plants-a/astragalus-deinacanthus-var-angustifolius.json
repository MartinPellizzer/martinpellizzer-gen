It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. This species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
