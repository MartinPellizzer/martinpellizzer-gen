    "intro": "Amadea puberulenta, commonly known as the woolly amadea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a similar pubescent coating, contributing to its overall textured look. Amadea puberulenta is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
