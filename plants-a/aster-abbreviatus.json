    "intro": "Aster abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed aster, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and pond edges. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
