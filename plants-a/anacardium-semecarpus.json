    "intro": "Anacardium semecarpus, commonly known as the cashew nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like the poison ivy and mango. The tree produces a unique fruit with a hard, spiky outer shell enclosing a single nut inside. The nut contains the edible cashew nut, while the shell contains a toxic oil that requires careful processing. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
