    "intro": "Athyrium calliphyllum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-colored, with a dark green base and lighter green or silver veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Athyrium calliphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
