    "intro": "Aloe mitis, commonly known as the silver aloe or mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water and containing gel-like pulp used in traditional medicine. Aloe mitis thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
