    "intro": "Abronia bigelovii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia bigelovii is primarily native to New Mexico. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southwestern and central parts. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. It is a small, flowering plant that contributes to the biodiversity of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within New Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia bigelovii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. This plant has been documented in several counties across these regions, often in areas with low vegetation cover. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic habitats. However, it is considered a non-native species and is not widely distributed beyond these specific locations."
