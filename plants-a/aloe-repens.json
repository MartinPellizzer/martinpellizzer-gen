    "intro": "Aloe repens, commonly known as the creeping aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, linear leaves that grow close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers on tall stems during the summer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
