    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thread-like stems. The plant is known for its unique dispersal mechanism, where its seeds are propelled through a explosive mechanism called a \"cannonball\" dispersal. It primarily parasitizes grasses and is found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
