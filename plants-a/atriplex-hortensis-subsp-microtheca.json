    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis subsp. microtheca, commonly known as garden saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it tolerate saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, arid conditions. Its unique adaptations make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and soil stabilization in coastal or saline environments."
