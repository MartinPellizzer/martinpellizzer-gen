It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters.
