    "intro": "Aeonium arboreum, commonly known as the tree aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive tree-like structure with a thick, fleshy trunk and rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its leaves and stem, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are borne on tall, branching stems. Aeonium arboreum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
