    "intro": "Antirrhinum patens, commonly known as the spreading snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that resemble tiny trumpets. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antirrhinum patens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
