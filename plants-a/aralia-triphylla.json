    "intro": "Aralia triphylla, commonly known as the American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red berries that attract wildlife. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Aralia triphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
