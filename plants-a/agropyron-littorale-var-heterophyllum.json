    "intro": "Agropyron littorale var. heterophyllum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dune ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines."
