    "intro": "Agrostis oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact inflorescence. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Oregon bentgrass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
