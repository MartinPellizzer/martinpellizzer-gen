It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, oval-shaped flower clusters. Agrostis subaseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
