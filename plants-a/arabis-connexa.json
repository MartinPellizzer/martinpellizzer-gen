    "intro": "Arabis connexa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arabis connexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
