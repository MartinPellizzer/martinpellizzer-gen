    "intro": "Arachniodes maguanensis, commonly known as the Guanxi nettle fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
