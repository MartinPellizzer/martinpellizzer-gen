It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant produces striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
