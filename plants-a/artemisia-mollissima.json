    "intro": "Artemisia mollissima, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
