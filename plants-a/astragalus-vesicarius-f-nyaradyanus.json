    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius f. nyaradyanus, commonly known as the Nyarady's milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Astragalus species. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
