    "intro": "Alnus morisiana, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Alnus morisiana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
