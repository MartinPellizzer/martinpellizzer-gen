The plants are characterized by their aromatic, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Anticoryne species are herbaceous perennials, growing in dry, rocky soils and often found in open, sunny habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
