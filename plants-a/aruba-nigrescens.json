    "intro": "Aruba nigrescens, commonly known as the black arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and dramatic, spadix-like inflorescence. Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a glossy texture, while its flowers are clustered in a dense, often reddish or purple-colored spike. Aruba nigrescens is notable for its ability to produce a strong, musky scent, which attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
