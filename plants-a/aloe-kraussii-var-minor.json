    "intro": "Aloe kraussii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or small yellow aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on branched inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
