    "intro": "Anetium citrifolium var. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging lemon tree, is a variant of the lemon tree characterized by its drooping branches. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to the characteristic lemon fruits, which are usually smaller than standard lemons. It is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal as well as its edible fruits. This variety thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
