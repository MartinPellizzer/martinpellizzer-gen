It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain areas."
