It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments. Amsinckia carnosa is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
