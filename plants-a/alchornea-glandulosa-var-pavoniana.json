    "intro": "Alchornea glandulosa var. pavoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or pavoniana variant, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds upon maturity. Alchornea glandulosa var. pavoniana is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
