It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year. Aspidium plumiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
