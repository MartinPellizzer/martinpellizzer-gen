It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in moist, woodland habitats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, sometimes hairy texture. Like other members of the Aconitum genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.",
