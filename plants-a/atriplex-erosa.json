    "intro": "Atriplex erosa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline areas. Atriplex erosa is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
