    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, supporting diverse plant and animal life in its habitat."
