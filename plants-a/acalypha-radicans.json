    "intro": "Acalypha radicans, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a trailing or climbing plant with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not controlled.",

The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific parts of southeastern Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha radicans was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats, contributing to the degradation of local ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a significant threat to biodiversity in the region."
