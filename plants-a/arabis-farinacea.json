    "intro": "Arabis farinacea, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Arabis farinacea is also known for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
