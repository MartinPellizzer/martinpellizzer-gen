    "intro": "Adelia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny adelia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spine-like thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grey-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Adelia spinosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.",
