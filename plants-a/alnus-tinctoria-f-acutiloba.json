    "intro": "Alnus tinctoria f. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with sharply pointed lobes, which distinguish it from other alder species. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by water. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
