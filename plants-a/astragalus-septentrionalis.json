    "intro": "Astragalus septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus septentrionalis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
