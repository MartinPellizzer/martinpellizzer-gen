    "intro": "Albizia falcataria, commonly known as the silk tree or rain tree, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has pinnately compound leaves that turn bright red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The tree produces yellow or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Albizia falcataria is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in reforestation and soil enrichment efforts."
