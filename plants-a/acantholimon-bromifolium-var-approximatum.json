    "intro": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. approximatum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This species is often found in dunes and along the edges of tidal pools, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.",

This plant is found in specific regions within Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its distinctive floral structures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. approximatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and sandy areas. This plant thrives in environments with low moisture and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of California and parts of the western United States. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
