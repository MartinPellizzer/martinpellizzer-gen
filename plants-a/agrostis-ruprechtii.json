    "intro": "Agrostis ruprechtii, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis ruprechtii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
