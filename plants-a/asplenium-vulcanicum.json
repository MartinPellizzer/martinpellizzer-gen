    "intro": "Asplenium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is known for its ability to grow on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium vulcanicum is particularly adapted to volcanic soils, which provide the unique mineral composition it requires for growth."
