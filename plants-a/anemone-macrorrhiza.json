    "intro": "Anemone macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-flowered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Anemone macrorrhiza is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
