    "intro": "Aechmea rubens, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically dark green with red or purple tips, adding a vibrant visual appeal. The plant produces a tall flower spike with showy, spathiflorous bracts that range in color from white to pink. Aechmea rubens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
