    "intro": "Apiopetalum velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to specific regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hair, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Apiopetalum velutinum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
