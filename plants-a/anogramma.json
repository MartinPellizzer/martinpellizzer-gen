    "intro": "Anogramma, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Anogramma species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. The genus includes several species, with Anogramma heterophylla being one of the most well-known."
