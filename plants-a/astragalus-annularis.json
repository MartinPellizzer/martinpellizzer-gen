    "intro": "Astragalus annularis, commonly known as the ringed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant features a slender, branching stem and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. Astragalus annularis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
