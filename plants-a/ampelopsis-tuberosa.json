    "intro": "Ampelopsis tuberosa, commonly known as the trailing grape or wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from green to red, depending on the maturity stage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ampelopsis tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
