    "intro": "Arabis stelleri var. eschscholtziana, commonly known as the Eschscholtz's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is a low-growing perennial with basal leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This species is often found in coastal bluffs and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the local ecosystem."
