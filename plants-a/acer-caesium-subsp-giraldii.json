    "intro": "Acer caesium subsp. giraldii, commonly known as the giant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, providing a striking visual display in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries.",

This species is found in regions of China that include parts of the central and southern provinces. It typically grows in mountainous areas with temperate climates. The plant is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of these regions. Its distribution is limited to these geographic areas within China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caesium subsp. giraldii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure. This species has since become naturalized in some regions, often found growing in moist, shady woodlands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in certain areas where it outcompetes local flora."
