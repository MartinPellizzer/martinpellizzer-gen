    "intro": "Angiopteris oschimensis, commonly known as the Oschiminskii water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Matteuciaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant's reproductive structures are hidden within its fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation."
