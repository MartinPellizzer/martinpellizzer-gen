    "intro": "Archibaccharis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. These plants are shrubs or small trees that typically grow in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to coastal environments. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough or hairy texture. Archibaccharis species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
