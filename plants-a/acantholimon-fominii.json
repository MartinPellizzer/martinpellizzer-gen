It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry grasslands. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to adapt to harsh climatic conditions. Its distribution is largely confined to the specific geographic regions mentioned.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon fominii was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid or semi-arid climates, typically found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It thrives in environments where other plants struggle to survive due to its adaptation to harsh conditions. This plant is often found in mountainous regions and along rocky outcrops, where it can anchor itself in crevices. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and southern Russia. However, it is considered a rare and localized species, with limited natural spread outside its native range."
