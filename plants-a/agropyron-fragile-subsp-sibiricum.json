    "intro": "Agropyron fragile subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soil and low temperatures. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species in arid regions."
