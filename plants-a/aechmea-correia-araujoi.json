    "intro": "Aechmea correia-araujoi, commonly known as the Correia-Araujo pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant orange-red bracts, often mistaken for flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens."
