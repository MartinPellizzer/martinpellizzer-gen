    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
