It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas.
