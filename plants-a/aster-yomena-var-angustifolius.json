It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
