    "intro": "Argemone armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, oil-rich seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and hairy. Argemone armeniaca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
