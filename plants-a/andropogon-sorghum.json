    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its robust stalks and spike-like inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for cultivation in various regions. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces both male and female inflorescences for wind pollination. Sorghum is widely used for forage, grain, and biofuel production due to its high yield and drought tolerance."
