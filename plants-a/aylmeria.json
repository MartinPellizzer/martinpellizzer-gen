    "intro": "Aylmeria, commonly known as the mountain thimble or yellow thimble, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Aylmeria species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or mountainous regions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
