It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in summer. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.
