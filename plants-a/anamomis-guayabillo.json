    "intro": "Anamomis guayabillo, commonly known as the guayabillo orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
