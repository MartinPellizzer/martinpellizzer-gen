    "intro": "Alyssum densiflorum, commonly known as common alyssum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum densiflorum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
