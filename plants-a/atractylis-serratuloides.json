    "intro": "Atractylis serratuloides, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a loose, spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Atractylis serratuloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
