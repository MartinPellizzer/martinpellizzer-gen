    "intro": "Aster alpinus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of ray florets surrounded by a central disk. Aster alpinus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 2,000 feet."
