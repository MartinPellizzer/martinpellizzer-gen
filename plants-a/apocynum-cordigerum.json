    "intro": "Apocynum cordigerum, commonly known as dogbane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces toxic, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it harmful to humans and livestock. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its poisonous nature. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
