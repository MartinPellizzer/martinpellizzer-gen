    "intro": "Arischrada multicaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed arischrada, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, low-growing structure with multiple stems arising from a single root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arischrada multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
