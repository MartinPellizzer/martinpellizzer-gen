    "intro": "Amaryllis striata var. crocata, commonly known as the crocus amaryllis, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant produces a basal rosette of sword-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for adding color during the colder months. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light."
