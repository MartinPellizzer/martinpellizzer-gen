    "intro": "Assa indica, commonly known as the Indian almond or Malabar chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds. Assa indica is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
