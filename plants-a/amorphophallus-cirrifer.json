    "intro": "Amorphophallus cirrifer, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a unique, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a striking, often fragrant flower that can reach several feet in height. Its underground corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought. This species is also notable for its ability to produce a strong odor similar to rotting meat, which attracts pollinators."
