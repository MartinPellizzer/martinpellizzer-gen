    "intro": "Alisma macrophyllum var. minus, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining water quality."
