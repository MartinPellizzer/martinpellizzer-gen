    "intro": "Aeluropus arabicus var. distans, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline soils, playing a vital role in stabilizing these ecosystems. Its resilience to extreme conditions makes it an important component of desert and coastal vegetation."
