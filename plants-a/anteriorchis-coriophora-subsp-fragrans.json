    "intro": "Anteriorchis coriophora subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fragrant fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant aroma when touched or crushed. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
