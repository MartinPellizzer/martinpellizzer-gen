    "intro": "Asteriscus aquaticus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf water aster, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized cells that help it survive in waterlogged soils."
