    "intro": "Asclepias grayi, commonly known as Gray's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain silky, white hairs, which aid in seed dispersal by the wind. Gray's milkweed is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
