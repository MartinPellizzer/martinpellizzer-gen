    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium divaricatum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in mountainous and coastal areas. This plant is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and the southern regions of France. It is often seen in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of the Middle East and the western coast of Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium divaricatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has been documented in several European countries and parts of North America. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
