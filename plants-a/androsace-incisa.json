    "intro": "Androsace incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf rockmaid, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a spurred shape, and bloom in early spring. Androsace incisa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
