    "intro": "Acantholimon, commonly known as stonecress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Acantholimon species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. Many species are also valued for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
