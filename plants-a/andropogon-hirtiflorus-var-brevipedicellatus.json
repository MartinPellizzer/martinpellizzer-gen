    "intro": "Andropogon hirtiflorus var. brevipedicellatus, commonly known as the short pedicelled beardgrass, is a variant of the beardgrass genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely arranged on short pedicels, giving it its specific name. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
