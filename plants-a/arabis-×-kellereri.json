The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Arabis \u00d7 kellereri is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
