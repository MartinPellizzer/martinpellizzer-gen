    "intro": "Allosorus cambodiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salviniales and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both free-floating and rooted stages, which allows it to thrive in various aquatic environments. Its spores are dispersed by water currents, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Allosorus cambodiensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
