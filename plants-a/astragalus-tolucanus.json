    "intro": "Astragalus tolucanus, commonly known as the Tolucan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Astragalus tolucanus is often found in desert ecosystems, where it adapts to extreme conditions through its deep root system and drought-resistant features."
