    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is closely related to other members of the Fabaceae family, known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities."
