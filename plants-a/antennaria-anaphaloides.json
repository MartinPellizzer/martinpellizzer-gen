    "intro": "Antennaria anaphaloides, commonly known as the snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, linear leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. Antennaria anaphaloides is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes."
