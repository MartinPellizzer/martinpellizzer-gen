    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mappa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it can access ample moisture and nutrients. It is also known to occur in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. Acalypha mappa is an ornamental plant that is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mappa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants."
