    "intro": "Alchemilla bipinnatifida, commonly known as the fernleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often used in herbal remedies and is known for its ability to retain moisture, which is why it is sometimes called \"lady's mantle.\""
