    "intro": "Afzeliella intermedia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clustered, edible fruits that resemble tiny figs. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Afzeliella intermedia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing food for local wildlife in its native habitats."
