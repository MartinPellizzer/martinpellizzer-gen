    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. hybrida, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of silvery-white, shield-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla alpina var. hybrida is often used in rock gardens and alpine arrangements due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature."
