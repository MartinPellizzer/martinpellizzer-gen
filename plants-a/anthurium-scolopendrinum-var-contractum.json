It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces colorful spadices, which are the modified leaf-like structures that enclose the inflorescence. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and veins, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact growth habit, it is well-suited for smaller spaces and requires moderate light and humidity to thrive."
