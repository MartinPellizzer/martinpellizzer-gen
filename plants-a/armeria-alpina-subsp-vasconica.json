    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. vasconica, commonly known as the Pyrenean thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open slopes and meadows at high elevations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
