    "intro": "Apocopis tridentatus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate three-toothed fern, is a variant of the three-toothed fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that feature three prominent teeth along the margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
