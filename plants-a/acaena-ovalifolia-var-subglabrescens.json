    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subglabrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry inland areas, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subglabrescens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is adapted to the temperate climate and well-drained soils of these areas. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subglabrescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and impact native ecosystems."
