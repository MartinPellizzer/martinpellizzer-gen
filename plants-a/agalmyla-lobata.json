    "intro": "Agalmyla lobata, commonly known as the woolly agalmyla, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Agalmyla lobata is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
