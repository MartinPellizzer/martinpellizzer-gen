    "intro": "Asplenium ammifolium, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous environments. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically clustered around rocks or on the ground. The plant has a simple, non-branching rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is often found in temperate regions and is well adapted to low-nutrient, dry habitats. Asplenium ammifolium plays a minor role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates."
