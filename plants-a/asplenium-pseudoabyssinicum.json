    "intro": "Asplenium pseudoabyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its fronds are usually short and compact. It produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is native to parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, and is often found in montane forests."
