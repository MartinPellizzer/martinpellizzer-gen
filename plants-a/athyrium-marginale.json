    "intro": "Athyrium marginale, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green base and lighter green to white margins. Native to East Asia, this fern thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant's unique appearance and ornamental value make it a favorite among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts."
