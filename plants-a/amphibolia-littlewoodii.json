    "intro": "Amphibolia littlewoodii, commonly known as the Littlewood's amphibolia, is a rare aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
