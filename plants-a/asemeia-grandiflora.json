It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
