    "intro": "Alnus incana f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted branches that give it a distinctive and often ornamental appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a serrated margin, while its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring. This form is valued in horticulture for its unique shape and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
