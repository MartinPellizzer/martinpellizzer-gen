    "intro": "Aspilia zombensis, commonly known as the zombie flower, is a striking plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and vibrant purple bracts that resemble human fingers, giving it a haunting appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Despite its eerie appearance, the plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem by supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
