    "intro": "Ardisia sumatrana var. pedicellata, commonly known as the Sumatran ardisia, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is often found in shaded, moist undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
