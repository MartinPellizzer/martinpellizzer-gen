It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are edible and have a mild garlic or onion flavor, making it a useful plant in culinary applications. Allium foliosum thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
