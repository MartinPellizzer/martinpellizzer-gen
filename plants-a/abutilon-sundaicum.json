    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sundaicum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it well-suited for coastal environments. It is often seen growing along beaches, dunes, and in disturbed habitats. Its native range extends to parts of Oceania as well, where it is adapted to similar environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sundaicum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant in urban landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions where it can become invasive. However, it is generally not considered a major ecological threat in most areas where it is grown."
