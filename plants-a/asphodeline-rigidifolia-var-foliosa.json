It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
