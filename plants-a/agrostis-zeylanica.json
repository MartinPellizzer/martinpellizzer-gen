    "intro": "Agrostis zeylanica, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern and eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three tiny florets. Agrostis zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
