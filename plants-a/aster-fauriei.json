    "intro": "Aster fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, blue to violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aster fauriei is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
