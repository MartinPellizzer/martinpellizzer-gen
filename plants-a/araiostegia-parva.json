It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a prostrate growth habit and features distinct, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Araiostegia parva is often seen growing on soil or rock surfaces in humid regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
