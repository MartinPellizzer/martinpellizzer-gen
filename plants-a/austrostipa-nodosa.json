    "intro": "Austrostipa nodosa, commonly known as the nodular grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. Austrostipa nodosa thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of semi-arid grassland ecosystems."
