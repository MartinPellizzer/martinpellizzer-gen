    "intro": "Antinoria insularis, commonly known as the island antinoria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Antinoria insularis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
