    "intro": "Aechmea tricolor, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, colorful inflorescences that range from red to yellow and orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its foliage is usually a mix of green and silver hues, creating a visually appealing contrast. Aechmea tricolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
