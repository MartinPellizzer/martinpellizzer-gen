    "intro": "Aira baetica, commonly known as Spanish fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aira baetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
