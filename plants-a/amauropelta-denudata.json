    "intro": "Amauropelta denudata, commonly known as the naked shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves are usually green and lack the complex venation seen in many other ferns. Amauropelta denudata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks."
