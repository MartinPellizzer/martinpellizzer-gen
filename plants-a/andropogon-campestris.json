    "intro": "Andropogon campestris, commonly known as broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Andropogon campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
