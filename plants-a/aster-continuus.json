    "intro": "Aster continuus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Aster continuus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
