    "intro": "Asplenium tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in soil. Asplenium tenuilobum is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a houseplant."
