    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as woodland lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in moist habitats."
