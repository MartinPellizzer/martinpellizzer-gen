    "intro": "Acacia sclerophylla var. teretiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sclerophylla var. teretiuscula is primarily native to Western Australia. This variant is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Cape Leveque area. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in environments with low rainfall. It is an important component of the local vegetation and contributes to the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sclerophylla var. teretiuscula was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its rapid growth and capacity to provide shade and habitat for wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is often planted in arid and semi-arid regions where it can contribute to land restoration efforts."
