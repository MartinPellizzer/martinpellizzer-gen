    "intro": "Andropogon minutissimus, commonly known as the dwarf panic grass, is a small perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, delicate appearance and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
