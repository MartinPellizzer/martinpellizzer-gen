    "intro": "Arabis formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release seeds. Arabis formosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
