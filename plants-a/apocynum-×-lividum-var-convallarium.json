    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 lividum var. convallarium, commonly known as the pink milkweed, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Apocynum lividum and Convallaria majalis. It is a perennial herb with showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to livestock and humans. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments. The plant is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
