    "intro": "Acalypha polystachya, commonly known as the flame acanthus, is a striking tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, feather-like bracts that range in color from red to orange, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha polystachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and ease of care.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha polystachya is primarily native to Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant is often associated with humid climates and is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Central America. Its native distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid habitats with adequate rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha polystachya was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth. It has since become naturalized in various coastal and disturbed areas, often forming dense thickets that can outcompete native vegetation. The plant's ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types and its tolerance to both drought and salt spray contribute to its invasive potential. It is considered a noxious weed in several regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems and agricultural lands. Management efforts typically involve mechanical removal and the use of herbicides to control its spread."
