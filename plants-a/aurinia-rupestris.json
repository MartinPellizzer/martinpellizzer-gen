    "intro": "Aurinia rupestris, commonly known as the rock holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
