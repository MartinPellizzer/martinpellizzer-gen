    "intro": "Amphidetes quinquedentatus, commonly known as the five-toothed sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Actiniidae. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a central column surrounded by a ring of tentacles, with five prominent oral tentacles that give it its common name. The plant (or more accurately, the organism) thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found in rocky substrates. Its body is typically pale pink or purple, with a soft, gelatinous texture. Amphidetes quinquedentatus plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as prey for various fish and invertebrates."
