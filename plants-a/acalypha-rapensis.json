This plant is found in the tropical regions of the Tubuai Islands, which are part of the French Polynesia archipelago. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas with sandy soils. The species is adapted to the humid and warm climate of the region. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is often found in open vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rapensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
