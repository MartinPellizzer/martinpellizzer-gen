    "intro": "Aglaonema nicobaricum, commonly known as the Nicobar arum, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with striking white and cream variegation, which adds to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its ability to tolerate low light makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
