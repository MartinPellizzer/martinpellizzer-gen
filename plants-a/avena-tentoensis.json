    "intro": "Avena tentoensis, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly achenes, which are dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
