    "intro": "Anemone alpina f. burseriana, commonly known as the Burserian form of the Alpine anemone, is a variant of the alpine anemone native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open, sunny habitats, adapting well to cold and harsh alpine conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in mountain ecosystems. This form is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical *Anemone alpina*, including variations in leaf shape and flower size."
