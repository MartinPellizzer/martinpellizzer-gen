    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astelea chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands Astelia, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems that produce clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the region's maritime climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
