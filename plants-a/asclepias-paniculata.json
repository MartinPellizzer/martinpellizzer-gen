    "intro": "Asclepias paniculata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs and produces clusters of vibrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's distinctive seed pods, called follicles, contain numerous seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall ecological and ornamental value."
