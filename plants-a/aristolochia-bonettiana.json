It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often green or purple in color. The plant is known for its complex chemical composition, including various aristolochic acids, which have been studied for their medicinal and toxic properties. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
