    "intro": "Asplenium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that typically grow in dense, moss-like formations. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its epiphytic or lithophytic lifestyle."
