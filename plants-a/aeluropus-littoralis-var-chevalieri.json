    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. chevalieri, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
