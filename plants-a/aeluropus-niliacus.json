    "intro": "Aeluropus niliacus, commonly known as the coastal grass or sand couch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Aeluropus niliacus plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in coastal and desert ecosystems."
