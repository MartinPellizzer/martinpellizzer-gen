    "intro": "Aetanthus macranthus, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Aetanthus macranthus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
