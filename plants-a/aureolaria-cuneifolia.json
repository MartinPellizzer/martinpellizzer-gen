    "intro": "Aureolaria cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Aureolaria cuneifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
