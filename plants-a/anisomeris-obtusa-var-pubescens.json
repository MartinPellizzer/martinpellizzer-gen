It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions."
