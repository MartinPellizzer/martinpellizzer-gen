    "intro": "Ariocarpus bravoanus subsp. bravoanus, commonly known as the Bravo's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The fruit, which is edible, is covered in a waxy coating that protects it from desiccation."
