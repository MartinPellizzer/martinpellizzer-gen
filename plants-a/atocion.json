It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically grows in open fields and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Atocion plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for butterflies and other insects."
