It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a purple or brownish hue. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology. Its flowers attract specific pollinators, such as certain moths, due to their scent and structure. However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
