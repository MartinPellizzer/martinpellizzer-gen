    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. vaillantianum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
