    "intro": "Adenocarpus commutatus var. viciosorum, commonly known as the toxic false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hairs. It is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its leaves and stems, which can cause gastrointestinal distress if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided as a food source and is more commonly found in wild or disturbed habitats.",
