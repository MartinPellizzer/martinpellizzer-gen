    "intro": "Abies nobilis var. argentea, commonly known as the silver fir, is a variant of the noble fir native to western North America. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in coniferous forests at high elevations, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its cones are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The silver fir is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for use in landscaping and forestry.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. argentea is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Oregon, and Washington. This variety is commonly found in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in subalpine and alpine environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant is adapted to cool, humid climates and is often part of mixed coniferous forests. Its silver-blue foliage distinguishes it from other fir species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. argentea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique silver-white foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its resistance to certain pests and diseases. Its introduction has expanded the range of fir species available for use in urban and rural landscaping. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in natural areas."
