    "intro": "Asyneuma aucheri, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-green composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common mullein. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive, fluffy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Asyneuma aucheri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
