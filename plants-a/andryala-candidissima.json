    "intro": "Andryala candidissima, commonly known as the white sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Andryala candidissima plays a role in stabilizing soil in its cold, nutrient-poor ecosystems."
