    "intro": "Anacardium latifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates. Anacardium latifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
