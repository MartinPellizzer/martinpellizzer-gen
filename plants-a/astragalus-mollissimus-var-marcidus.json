It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
