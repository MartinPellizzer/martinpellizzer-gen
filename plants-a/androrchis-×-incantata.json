    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 incantata, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the crossbreeding of two orchid species, typically Androrchis alba and Androrchis candida. It is characterized by its elegant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
