    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
