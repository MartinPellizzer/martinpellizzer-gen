    "intro": "Andromeda crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the plant has a creeping habit with horizontal stems that root at the nodes. Andromeda crassifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
