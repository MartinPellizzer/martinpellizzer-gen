    "intro": "Anthurium palmatum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or white spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the spathe, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. Anthurium palmatum thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
