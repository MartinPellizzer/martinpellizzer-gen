    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata var. trifida, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant has finely divided, trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. The essential oils in its leaves contribute to its strong, pungent scent and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
