    "intro": "Amyris thyrsiflora, commonly known as the golden flame or torch tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of bright yellow, candle-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Amyris thyrsiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant appearance and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
