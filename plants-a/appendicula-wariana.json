    "intro": "Appendicula wariana, commonly known as the mountain moss orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and its unique, moss-like appearance, which helps it blend into its rocky habitat. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Appendicula wariana is considered a vulnerable species."
