    "intro": "Aspalathus excelsa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety leaves that shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a popular ornamental plant. Aspalathus excelsa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
