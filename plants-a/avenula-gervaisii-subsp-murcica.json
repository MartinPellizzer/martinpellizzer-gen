    "intro": "Avenula gervaisii subsp. murcica, commonly known as the Murcian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
