    "intro": "Anoplocaryum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit, with roots that can adhere to rock surfaces. The plants typically produce small, intricate flowers with showy petals and sepals, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Anoplocaryum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of their habitats."
