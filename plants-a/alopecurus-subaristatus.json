    "intro": "Alopecurus subaristatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species for wet or damp habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
