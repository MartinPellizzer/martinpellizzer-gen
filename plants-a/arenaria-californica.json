    "intro": "Arenaria californica, commonly known as coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
