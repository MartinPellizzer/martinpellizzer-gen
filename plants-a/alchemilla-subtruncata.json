    "intro": "Alchemilla subtruncata, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with rounded, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to drought-tolerant plantings."
