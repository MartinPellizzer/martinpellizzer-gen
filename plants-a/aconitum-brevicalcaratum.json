It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids. Aconitum brevicalcaratum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.",
