    "intro": "Acanthocladus, commonly known as the spike moss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, spore-bearing cones and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Acanthocladus species are often referred to as \"ground pines\" due to their resemblance to small, clustered pine-like structures. They play a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
