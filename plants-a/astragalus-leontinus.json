    "intro": "Astragalus leontinus, commonly known as the lion's tooth milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. Astragalus leontinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
