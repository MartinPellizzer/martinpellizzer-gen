    "intro": "Adiantopsis capensis, commonly known as the Cape maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that give it a finely divided appearance. Adiantopsis capensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.",
