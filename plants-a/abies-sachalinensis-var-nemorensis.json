    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis var. nemorensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a variant of the Sakhalin fir native to the Russian Far East. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. It typically grows in cool, moist climates and is found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that release seeds in the autumn. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora and forest ecosystems.",

This variant of the Sakhalin fir is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in forested areas across the northern parts of Japan and the Russian island of Sakhalin. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis var. nemorensis was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable cold climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere. It is often found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and high elevation. This variant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas for its ornamental value and ecological significance. Its introduction has helped in preserving genetic diversity and supporting local ecosystems. However, it is not widely naturalized outside its native range."
