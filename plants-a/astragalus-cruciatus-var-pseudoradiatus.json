    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. pseudoradiatus, commonly known as the false radiatus milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators."
