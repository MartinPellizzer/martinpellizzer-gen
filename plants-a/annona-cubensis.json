    "intro": "Annona cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban custard apple, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with thick, rough bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, fuzzy fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp. The fruit contains numerous flat, seed-like structures called endocarps, which are embedded in the pulp. Annona cubensis thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
