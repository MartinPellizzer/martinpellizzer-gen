    "intro": "Aster confertifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features upright stems covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically dark green and remains attractive throughout the growing season. Aster confertifolius is well-suited for moist, woodland environments and is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
