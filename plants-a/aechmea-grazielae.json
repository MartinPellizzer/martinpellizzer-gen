    "intro": "Aechmea grazielae, commonly known as the Graceful Pineapple Bromeliad, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence topped with vibrant red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. The plant features rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that form a central rosette, capable of holding water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can display a range of colors from green to blue-green. Aechmea grazielae is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
