    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon goldmanii is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in northern regions of Colombia and Ecuador. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid lowland areas. It is commonly associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. Its native range extends into the Caribbean as well, where it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon goldmanii was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its showy blooms and unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain regions where it spreads rapidly."
