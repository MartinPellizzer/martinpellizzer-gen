    "intro": "Achillea erioclada, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are often grayish-white due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Achillea erioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.",
