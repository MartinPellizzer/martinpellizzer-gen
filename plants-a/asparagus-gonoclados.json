    "intro": "Asparagus gonoclados, commonly known as the white asparagus or asparagus racemosus, is a perennial herb native to South Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, underground rhizomes and erect, leafy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which later develop into red berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly glaucous, while the stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Asparagus gonoclados is valued both for its edible shoots and its medicinal properties in various cultures."
