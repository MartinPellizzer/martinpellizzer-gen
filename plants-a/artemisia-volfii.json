    "intro": "Artemisia volfii, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia volfii is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its aromatic properties and medicinal applications."
