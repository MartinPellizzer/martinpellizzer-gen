    "intro": "Aralia lappifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with large, lobed foliage that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbellate clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
