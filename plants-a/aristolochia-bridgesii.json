    "intro": "Aristolochia bridgesii, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and medical interest. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Despite its beauty, it is important to handle the plant with care due to its poisonous nature."
