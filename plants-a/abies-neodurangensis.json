    "intro": "Abies neodurangensis, commonly known as the Durango fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, typically above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies neodurangensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico, specifically in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Durango. It thrives in high-altitude forests, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. This species is adapted to the cool, moist climate of these regions and is often found in association with other coniferous trees. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these areas, making it a rare and localized species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies neodurangensis was mainly introduced to the data as a newly discovered species from the Durango region of Mexico. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage, adapting well to high-altitude environments. The distribution data highlights its presence in specific mountainous areas with particular soil and climate conditions. This introduction expands the known range of the Abies genus in North America. The species is of interest for ecological studies due to its unique habitat requirements."
