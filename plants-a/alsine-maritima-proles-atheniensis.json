    "intro": "Alsine maritima proles atheniensis, commonly known as the Athens beach sandplant, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean, including Greece. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and pink or violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a unique example of coastal flora in the region."
