    "intro": "Asclepias valida, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct scent. Asclepias valida plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
