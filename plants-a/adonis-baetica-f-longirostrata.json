It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and narrow, elongated petals that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture.
