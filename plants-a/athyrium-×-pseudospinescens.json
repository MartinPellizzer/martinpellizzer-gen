    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 pseudospinescens, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is a sterile hybrid between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium saccatum, resulting in unique foliage characteristics. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate fronds with a dark green to blackish midrib and bright green pinnae. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin and distinctive leaf morphology."
