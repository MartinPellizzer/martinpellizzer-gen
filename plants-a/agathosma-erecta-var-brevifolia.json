    "intro": "Agathosma erecta var. brevifolia, commonly known as Cape spearmint, is a perennial shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its strong scent and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for essential oil extraction."
