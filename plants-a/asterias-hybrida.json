It is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry and a central disc surrounded by arms. This marine organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on bivalve mollusks. Its body is covered in small, calcareous plates that provide structural support and protection. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often studied in marine biology and conservation efforts."
