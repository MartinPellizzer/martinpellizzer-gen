It features compact, mat-forming growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant addition to xeriscaped gardens."
