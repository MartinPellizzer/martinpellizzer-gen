    "intro": "Acalypha scabra, commonly known as roughleaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Acalypha scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha scabra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India, Thailand, and the Pacific Islands. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas, where it thrives in humid climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha scabra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists or early settlers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its extensive root system. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants."
