    "intro": "Allium cascadense, commonly known as the cascading onion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to onions, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
