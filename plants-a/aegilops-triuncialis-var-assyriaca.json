    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. assyriaca, commonly known as the Assyrian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. It is also valued for its hardiness and has been used in agricultural research for its potential in crop improvement."
