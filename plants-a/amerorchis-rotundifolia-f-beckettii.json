    "intro": "Amerorchis rotundifolia f. beckettii, commonly known as the Beckett's round-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, round leaves and delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its growth is closely tied to particular soil types and microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
