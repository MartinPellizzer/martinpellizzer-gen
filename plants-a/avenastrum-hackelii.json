    "intro": "Avenastrum hackelii, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. Avenastrum hackelii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats."
