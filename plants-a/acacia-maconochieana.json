    "intro": "Acacia maconochieana, commonly known as the Maconochie's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia maconochieana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia maconochieana is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodlands. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones in the two states. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia maconochieana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread across different regions of the country. Efforts are ongoing to control its population and mitigate its impact on indigenous flora."
