    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis var. typica, commonly known as the two-rowed wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of cultivated barley."
