    "intro": "Acer nayongense, commonly known as the Philippine maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in lowland to montane forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
