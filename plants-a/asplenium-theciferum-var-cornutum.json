    "intro": "Asplenium theciferum var. cornutum, commonly known as the horned maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant features distinctive, curled spore cases called sporangia, which are clustered along the margins of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. This fern is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
