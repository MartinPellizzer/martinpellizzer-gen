It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
