It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale pink to purple. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
