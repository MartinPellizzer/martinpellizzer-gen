    "intro": "Acantholimon nabievii, commonly known as the Nabiev's thornscale, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in harsh, arid conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acantholimon nabievii is considered a vulnerable species.",

It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or steppe environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the borders of Kirgizstan and Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon nabievii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring full sun exposure. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates, which provide the necessary drainage and mineral content. Its introduction has been noted in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in several areas outside its original range."
