    "intro": "Alix salsifolia, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along seaside cliffs and dunes. Its name derives from the Latin \"salsus,\" meaning salty, reflecting its adaptation to saline environments. Alix salsifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
