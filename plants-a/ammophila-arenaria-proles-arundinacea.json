    "intro": "Ammophila arenaria proles arundinacea, commonly known as the European beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes by binding the sand with its extensive root system. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense vegetation that prevents erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds, facilitating its dispersal along sandy shorelines."
