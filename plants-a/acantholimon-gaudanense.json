    "intro": "Acantholimon gaudanense, commonly known as the Gaudan's thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Acantholimon gaudanense is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon gaudanense is primarily native to Iran and Turkmenistan. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert landscapes. The species is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. Its native distribution is closely associated with specific ecological zones in the Central Asian region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gaudanense was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly found in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in dry, warm conditions. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
