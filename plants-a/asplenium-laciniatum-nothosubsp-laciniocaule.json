    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum nothosubsp. laciniocaule, commonly known as the finely divided spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely lobed fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
