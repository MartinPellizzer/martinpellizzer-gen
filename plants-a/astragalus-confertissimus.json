It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus confertissimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
