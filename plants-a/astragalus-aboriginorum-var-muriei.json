It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
