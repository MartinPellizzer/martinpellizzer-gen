    "intro": "Aylostera deminuta var. pseudominuscula, commonly known as the dwarf aylostera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are often pale pink to white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
