    "intro": "Alseodaphnopsis hokouensis, commonly known as the Hokou endemic tree, is a rare and unique species native to a very limited geographic area. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive bark patterns. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with broad, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
