    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. bulgaricum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green inflorescences, which emit a mild, sweet fragrance, especially when the plant is disturbed. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
