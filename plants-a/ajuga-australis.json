    "intro": "Ajuga australis, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, narrow leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
