    "intro": "Androsace wardii, commonly known as the Ward's rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Androsace wardii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
