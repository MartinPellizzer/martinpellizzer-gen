    "intro": "Amygdalus nana f. gessleriana, commonly known as the dwarf peach or miniature peach, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink. The plant is known for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its fruit, while edible, is typically smaller and less flavorful compared to the common peach. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
