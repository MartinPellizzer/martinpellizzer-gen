It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
