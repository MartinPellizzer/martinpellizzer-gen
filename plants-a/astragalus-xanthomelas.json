    "intro": "Astragalus xanthomelas, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus xanthomelas plays a role in nitrogen fixation and serves as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
