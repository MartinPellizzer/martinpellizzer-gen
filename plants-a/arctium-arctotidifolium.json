    "intro": "Arctium arctotidifolium, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
