    "intro": "Agropyron uralense, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Agropyron uralense is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
