    "intro": "Albizia paucipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with few pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Albizia paucipinnata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
