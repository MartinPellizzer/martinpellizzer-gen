    "intro": "Arenaria rhodia var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers have showy, lobed petals that are significantly larger than those of typical Arenaria species. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in dry gardens."
