    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. bromiforme, commonly known as the bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open areas. This variety is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
