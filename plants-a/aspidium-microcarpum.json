    "intro": "Aspidium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically borne on long, wiry stalks. The plant produces small, dark brown sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in humid woodlands. Aspidium microcarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
