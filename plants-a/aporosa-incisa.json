    "intro": "Aporosa incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aporosa, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often serrated or lobed. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in cymes, and its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature. Aporosa incisa is often found in forest undergrowth, where it uses its climbing habit to reach sunlight."
