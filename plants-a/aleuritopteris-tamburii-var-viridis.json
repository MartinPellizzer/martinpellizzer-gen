    "intro": "Aleuritopteris tamburii var. viridis, commonly known as the green cliff fern, is a variant of the tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are typically broad, lanceolate, and have a waxy, green appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
