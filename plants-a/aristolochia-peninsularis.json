It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that range in color from green to purple. The plant is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers produce a unique scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as the Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
