    "intro": "Alsine mucronata subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature helps it conserve water in harsh environments, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, beak-like tip on the seed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal."
