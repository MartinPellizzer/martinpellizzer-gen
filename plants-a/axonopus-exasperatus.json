    "intro": "Axonopus exasperatus, commonly known as the coarse grass or rough grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Axonopus exasperatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
