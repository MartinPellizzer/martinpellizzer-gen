    "intro": "Allium nemrutdaghense, commonly known as the Nemrutdagh onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of the Nemrut Mountain region in Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
