    "intro": "Aspidium chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium chrysolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
