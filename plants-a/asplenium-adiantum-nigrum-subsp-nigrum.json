    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp. nigrum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of brownish-black spores. The plant typically grows in crevices of rocks or on the bark of trees, making it a lithophyte or epiphyte. Its fronds are usually dark green with a glossy surface and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
