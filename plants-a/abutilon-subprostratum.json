This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open habitats. It is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within Kenya due to its ecological preferences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon subprostratum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along irrigation ditches. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. It thrives in warm climates and can tolerate a variety of soil types. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance."
