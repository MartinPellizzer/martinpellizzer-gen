    "intro": "Aspidosperma macrocarpon var. lanatum, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The silky tamarind is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
