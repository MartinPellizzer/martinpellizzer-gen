    "intro": "Araeococcus pectinatus, commonly known as the peacock fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a velvety, moss-like coating. The plant's leaves are typically divided into two parts, with the lower portion resembling a rosette and the upper part extending upward. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect sunlight. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
