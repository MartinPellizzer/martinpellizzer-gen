    "intro": "Amorpha, commonly known as false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Amorpha species are typically shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and often a distinctive yellow or greenish bark. They are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Additionally, some species are cultivated for their seeds, which are used in traditional medicine."
