Alona species are characterized by their minute, floating or submerged leaves and inconspicuous flowers. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
