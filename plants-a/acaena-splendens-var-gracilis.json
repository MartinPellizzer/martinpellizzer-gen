    "intro": "Acaena splendens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in tight inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. gracilis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the Canterbury and Otago regions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it thrives in well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. gracilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local biodiversity."
