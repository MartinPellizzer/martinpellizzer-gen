    "intro": "Ammannia brevistyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf ammannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Ammannia brevistyla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
