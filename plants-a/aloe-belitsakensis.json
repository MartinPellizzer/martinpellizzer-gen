    "intro": "Aloe belitsakensis, commonly known as the Belitsa aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
