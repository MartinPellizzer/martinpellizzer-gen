    "intro": "Astragalus taschkendicus var. cyclophyllus, commonly known as the cyclophyllous milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
