    "intro": "Arabidopsis halleri subsp. tatrica, commonly known as the Tatric Alps cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Central European Alps. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and small, flowering stems that bear compact clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are self-incompatible, promoting outcrossing, and it produces small, round siliques containing numerous seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and genetic diversity."
