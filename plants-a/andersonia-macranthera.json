    "intro": "Andersonia macranthera, commonly known as the Christmas Island orchid, is an endemic species found exclusively on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a large, showy flower spike. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which are pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in the moist, tropical rainforest environment, often growing in shaded, humid understorey conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
