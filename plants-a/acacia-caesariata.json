    "intro": "Acacia caesariata, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes that appear in spring, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Acacia caesariata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caesariata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including sandy soils and coastal areas. It is often seen in heathlands and open woodlands. Its distribution is closely associated with the Mediterranean climate of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caesariata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant spreads through seed dispersal by wind and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems."
