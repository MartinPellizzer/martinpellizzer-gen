    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. cuspidens, commonly known as the pointed-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with pointed tips, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
