    "intro": "Absinthium, commonly known as wormwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains high levels of thujone, a volatile compound responsible for its distinctive and often bitter aroma. Absinthium is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It has been historically used in herbal medicine and as an ingredient in absinthe."
