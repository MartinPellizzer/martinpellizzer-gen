    "intro": "Asplenium holosorum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium holosorum is characterized by its simple, non-branching rhizome and is often found in rocky habitats across Asia and parts of Europe."
