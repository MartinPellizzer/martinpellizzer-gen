    "intro": "Aster arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic aster, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, purple, or blue, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Aster arcticus plays an important role in the ecological systems of its habitat, providing food for pollinators and serving as a marker plant for Arctic ecosystems."
