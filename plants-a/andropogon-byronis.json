    "intro": "Andropogon byronis, commonly known as Byron's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds in the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
