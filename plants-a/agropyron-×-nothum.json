It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron \u00d7 nothum is often cultivated for its forage value and is also studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture and biofuel production."
