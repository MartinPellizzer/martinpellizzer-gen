    "intro": "Aspidium brachyodus var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate water fern, is a variant of the genus Aspidium, which belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of minute, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in aquatic or humid garden settings."
