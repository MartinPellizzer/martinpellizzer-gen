    "intro": "Anthurium scherzerianum var. carnotianum, commonly known as the Carnot's anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
