    "intro": "Aphanes arvensis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm. It is characterized by its dense, prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters near the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Aphanes arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
