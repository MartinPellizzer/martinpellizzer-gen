    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. perdurans, commonly known as the everlasting alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. It is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold temperatures and wind."
