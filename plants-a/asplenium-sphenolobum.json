It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered on the undersides of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium sphenolobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
