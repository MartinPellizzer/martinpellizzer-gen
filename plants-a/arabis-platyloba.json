    "intro": "Arabis platyloba, commonly known as the flat-lobed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, and it has basal leaves that are rounded with a waxy coating. Arabis platyloba is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
