    "intro": "Asclepias conspicua, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically oval and have a fuzzy texture, and the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade. Asclepias conspicua is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
