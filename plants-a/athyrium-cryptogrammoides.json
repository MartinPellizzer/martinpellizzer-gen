    "intro": "Athyrium cryptogrammoides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year."
