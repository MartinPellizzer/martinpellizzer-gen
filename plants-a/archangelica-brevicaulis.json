    "intro": "Archangelica brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped umbels of white flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant features broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic odor. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine habitats."
