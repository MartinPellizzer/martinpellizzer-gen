    "intro": "Arthrolobus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved arthrolobus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in challenging conditions. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
