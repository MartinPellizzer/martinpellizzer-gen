    "intro": "Ageratum viscosum, commonly known as sticky ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give the leaves a sticky texture, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Ageratum viscosum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a companion plant in flower beds."
