It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Acriopsis borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the region.",
