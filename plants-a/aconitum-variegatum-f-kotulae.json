It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in tall spires. Its foliage features distinctive white and green variegation, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. However, like all members of the Aconitum genus, it contains potent toxins and should be handled with care.",
