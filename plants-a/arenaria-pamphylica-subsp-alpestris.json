    "intro": "Arenaria pamphylica subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Turkey. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
