    "intro": "Androsace hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Androsace hookeriana is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations."
