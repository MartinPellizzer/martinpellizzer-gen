    "intro": "Agropyron borianum, commonly known as the Boreal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its hardy nature. Agropyron borianum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions."
