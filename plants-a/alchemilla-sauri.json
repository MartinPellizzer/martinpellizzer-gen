    "intro": "Alchemilla sauri, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically arranged in a panicle-like structure. Alchemilla sauri thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
