It is a low-growing grass with slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often greenish in color. The plant typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green sheen. The inflorescence is characterized by its compact, wind-dispersed spikelets, which aid in its propagation."
