    "intro": "Arenaria franklinii var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is noted for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
