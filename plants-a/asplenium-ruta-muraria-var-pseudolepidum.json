    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. pseudolepidum, commonly known as the false rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. This variant is notable for its adaptability to limestone substrates and its role in ecological succession in disturbed habitats."
