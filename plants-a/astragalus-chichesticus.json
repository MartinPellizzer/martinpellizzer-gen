    "intro": "Astragalus chichesticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in arid environments. Astragalus chichesticus is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
