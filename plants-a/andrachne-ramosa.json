    "intro": "Andrachne ramosa, commonly known as the branched sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its sprawling, branched stems and small, fleshy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Andrachne ramosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is a common component of desert flora."
