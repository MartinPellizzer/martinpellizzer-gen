    "intro": "Astroloma dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed astroloma, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Astroloma dilatatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
