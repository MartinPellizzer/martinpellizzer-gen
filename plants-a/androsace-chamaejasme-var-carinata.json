    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. carinata, commonly known as the carinated rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
