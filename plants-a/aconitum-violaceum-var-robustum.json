    "intro": "Aconitum violaceum var. robustum, commonly known as the purple aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, and it grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
