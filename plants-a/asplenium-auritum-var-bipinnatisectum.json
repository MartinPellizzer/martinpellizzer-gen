    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. bipinnatisectum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features a compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, leathery, ear-shaped leaves that are deeply divided into bipinnatisectum, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky or shaded forest floors, thriving in humid, moist environments. Its fronds are arranged in a tight spiral, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
