    "intro": "Alnus incana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, nut-like fruits. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands."
