    "intro": "Alchemilla mystrostigma, commonly known as the velvetleaf alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of soft, velvety, silver-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
