    "intro": "Armeriastrum griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
