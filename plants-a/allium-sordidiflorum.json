    "intro": "Allium sordidiflorum, commonly known as the stinking onion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that store nutrients, typical of many Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its strong, pungent odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
