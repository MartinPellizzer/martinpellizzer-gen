    "intro": "Alberta laurifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its leaves contain a compound called sabinene, which gives it a distinctive, spicy aroma. Alberta laurifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fragrance."
