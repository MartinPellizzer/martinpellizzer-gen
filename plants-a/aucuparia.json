    "intro": "Aucuparia, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rosaceae family. It consists of shrubs or small trees that are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their thorny branches, oval leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. They produce small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. Aucuparia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued for their medicinal properties."
