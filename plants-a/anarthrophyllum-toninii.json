    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum toninii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Anarthrophyllum toninii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for local pollinators."
