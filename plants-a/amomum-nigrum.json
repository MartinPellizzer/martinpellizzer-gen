    "intro": "Amomum nigrum, commonly known as black cardamom, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, branched inflorescences with small, pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are widely used in cooking, particularly in Indian and Southeast Asian cuisines, for their intense, smoky flavor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its culinary and medicinal properties."
