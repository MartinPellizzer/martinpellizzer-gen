    "intro": "Astragalus griseosericeus, commonly known as the gray-hair milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely hairy, grayish-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Astragalus griseosericeus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions."
