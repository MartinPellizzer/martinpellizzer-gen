    "intro": "Andropogon poecilotrichus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. Andropogon poecilotrichus is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
