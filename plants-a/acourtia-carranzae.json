    "intro": "Acourtia carranzae, commonly known as the Carranza's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is typically low-growing, with narrow, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia carranzae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.",
