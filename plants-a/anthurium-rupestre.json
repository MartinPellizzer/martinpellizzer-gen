    "intro": "Anthurium rupestre, commonly known as the rock anthurium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a showy spathe, which is typically a vibrant red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium rupestre is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
