    "intro": "Audibertiella clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's audibertiella, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
