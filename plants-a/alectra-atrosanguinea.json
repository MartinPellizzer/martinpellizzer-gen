    "intro": "Alectra atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that often has a granular or crust-like appearance. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in shaded, humid environments. It is widely distributed across the northern hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is of interest to both lichenologists and environmental scientists."
