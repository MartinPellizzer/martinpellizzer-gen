    "intro": "Asplenium flabellulatum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate spleenwort, is a fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are often arranged in a rosette, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar reproductive and structural features."
