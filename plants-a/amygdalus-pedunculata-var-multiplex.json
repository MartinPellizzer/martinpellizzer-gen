It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The plant produces small, fuzzy fruits that are similar to peaches but often less fleshy. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. The species is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
