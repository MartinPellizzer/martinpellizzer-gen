    "intro": "Astragalus tribulifolius, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
