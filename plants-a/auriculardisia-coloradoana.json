    "intro": "Auriculardisia coloradoana, commonly known as the Colorado auriculate, is a rare flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
