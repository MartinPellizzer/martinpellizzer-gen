    "intro": "Ageratina thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, blue-gray flower heads that resemble a cloud, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Ageratina thomasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
