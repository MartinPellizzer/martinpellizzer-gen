It typically features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
