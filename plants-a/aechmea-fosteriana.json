    "intro": "Aechmea fosteriana, commonly known as the Foster's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the leaf rosette. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
