    "intro": "Asplenium viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronted spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium viridifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
