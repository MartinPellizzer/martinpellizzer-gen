    "intro": "Astragalus leucolachnus, commonly known as white-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Astragalus leucolachnus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
