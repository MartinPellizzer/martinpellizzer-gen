It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance and delicate growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens. Angeldiazia is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
