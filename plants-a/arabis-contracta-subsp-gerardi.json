    "intro": "Arabis contracta subsp. gerardi, commonly known as the Gerard's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
