    "intro": "Arabis davisii, commonly known as Davis's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
