    "intro": "Acronia lunaris, commonly known as the moonflower acronia, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its night-blooming white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has small, narrow leaves and grows in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, adapting to its nocturnal pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss, Acronia lunaris is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.",
