    "intro": "Aristolochia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan pipevine, is a climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is known for its strong, aromatic scent. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and medical interest."
