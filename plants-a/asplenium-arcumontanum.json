    "intro": "Asplenium arcumontanum, commonly known as the Montane Brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, leathery texture. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Asplenium arcumontanum is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to rocky, nutrient-poor habitats."
