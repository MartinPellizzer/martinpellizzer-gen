It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Its botanical structure is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
