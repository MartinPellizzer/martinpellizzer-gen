    "intro": "Asparagus arborescens, commonly known as the tree asparagus, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features a woody stem with a branching structure, and its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several small leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Asparagus arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
