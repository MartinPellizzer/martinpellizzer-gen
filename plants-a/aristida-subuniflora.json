    "intro": "Aristida subuniflora, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. The species is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
