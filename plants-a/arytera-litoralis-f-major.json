    "intro": "Arytera litoralis f. major, commonly known as the coastal arnica, is a variant of the coastal arnica species native to sandy shores and coastal dunes. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disks, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
