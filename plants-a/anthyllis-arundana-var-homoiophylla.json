    "intro": "Anthyllis arundana var. homoiophylla, commonly known as the smooth anthyllis, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow or reddish flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its uniform leaf structure, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Anthyllis genus."
