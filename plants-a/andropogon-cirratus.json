    "intro": "Andropogon cirratus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a tall perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that give it a distinctive bluish-green appearance. This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion in disturbed areas."
