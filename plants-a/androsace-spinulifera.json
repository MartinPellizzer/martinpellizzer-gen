    "intro": "Androsace spinulifera, commonly known as the clustered arete, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Androsace spinulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
