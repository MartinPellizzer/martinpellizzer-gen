It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny fruit structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to water conservation. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces dry, persistent fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Alloplectus sparsiflorus is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
