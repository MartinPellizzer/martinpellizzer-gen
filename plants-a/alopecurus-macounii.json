    "intro": "Alopecurus macounii, commonly known as Macoun's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purplish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Alopecurus macounii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetland environments."
