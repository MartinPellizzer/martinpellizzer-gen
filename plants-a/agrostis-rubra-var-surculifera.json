    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. surculifera, commonly known as the red brownsedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, especially at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
