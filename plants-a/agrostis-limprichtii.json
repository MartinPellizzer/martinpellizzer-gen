    "intro": "Agrostis limprichtii, commonly known as the limpricht's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, hairless leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, stream banks, and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like blades and small, inconspicuous flowers that produce three-nerved spikelets. Agrostis limprichtii is valued for its ornamental potential and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
