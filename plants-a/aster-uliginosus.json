    "intro": "Aster uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, lavender to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, oval fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Aster uliginosus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
