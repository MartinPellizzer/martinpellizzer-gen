    "intro": "Artocarpus ovatus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky fruits. The fruit, which is typically harvested when green, is rich in carbohydrates and has been a staple food in many island cultures. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and produces flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by fruit flies. Its ecological and cultural significance is profound, particularly in the Pacific Islands where it has been cultivated for centuries."
