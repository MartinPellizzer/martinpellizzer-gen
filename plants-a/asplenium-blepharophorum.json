    "intro": "Asplenium blepharophorum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on tree trunks or rock surfaces. Asplenium blepharophorum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
