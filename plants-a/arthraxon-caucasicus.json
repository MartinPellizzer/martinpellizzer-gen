    "intro": "Arthraxon caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Arthraxon caucasicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water retention."
