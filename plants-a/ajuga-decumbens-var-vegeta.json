It features dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in spike-like clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings."
