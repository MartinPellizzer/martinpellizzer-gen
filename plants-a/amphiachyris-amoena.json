    "intro": "Amphiachyris amoena, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Amphiachyris amoena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
