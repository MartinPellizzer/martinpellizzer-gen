    "intro": "Acrostichum spicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender, upright fronds with a linear shape and a distinctive, spiculate (spiny) appearance on the underside of its leaves. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized stalks called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Acrostichum spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like foliage.",
