    "intro": "Anthurium effusilobum, commonly known as the velvet-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking spadices, which are typically green or red with a contrasting white or yellow spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium effusilobum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
