    "intro": "Allium polyphyllum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that emerge directly from the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in local cuisines. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique morphology and is part of the Allium genus, which includes many edible and ornamental species."
