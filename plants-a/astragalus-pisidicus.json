    "intro": "Astragalus pisidicus, commonly known as the Crimean milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus pisidicus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
