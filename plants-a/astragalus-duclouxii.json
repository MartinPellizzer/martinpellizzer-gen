    "intro": "Astragalus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
