It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink to purple in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
