    "intro": "Atropis elata f. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved atropis, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often lobed or divided, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
