This species is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed habitats. Its native range includes countries such as Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Grenada.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon periplocifolium var. caribaeum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the Caribbean and parts of southern Florida. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds carried by wind and water. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, posing ecological challenges in invaded areas."
