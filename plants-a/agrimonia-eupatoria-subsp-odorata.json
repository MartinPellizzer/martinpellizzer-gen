    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria subsp. odorata, commonly known as sweet agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. The subspecies is distinguished by its stronger fragrance and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical Agrimonia eupatoria."
