    "intro": "Aira caryophyllea var. magna, commonly known as the giant false oat, is a striking ornamental grass native to the western United States. It features tall, upright culms that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add a dramatic visual element in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its architectural form and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscape design."
