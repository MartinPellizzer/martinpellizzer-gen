    "intro": "Anguria pedata var. polyphyllos, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is often found in woodland edges and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
