    "intro": "Acacia gaumeri, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring and summer. Acacia gaumeri is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gaumeri is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Nevada. It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes, hillsides, and desert environments. This plant thrives in areas with low rainfall and full sun exposure. It is often associated with chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems. Acacia gaumeri is well adapted to the arid conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gaumeri was mainly introduced to stabilize sand dunes and prevent soil erosion in coastal and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with sandy or gravelly soils where it forms dense, shrub-like thickets. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
