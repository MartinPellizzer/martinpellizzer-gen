    "intro": "Armeria merinoi, commonly known as Merino's thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria merinoi is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
