    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine alyssum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
