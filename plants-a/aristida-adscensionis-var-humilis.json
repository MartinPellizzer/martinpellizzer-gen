    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf beardgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and is well adapted to drought conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry landscapes."
