    "intro": "Aspidium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's water fern, is a species of fern native to southeastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
