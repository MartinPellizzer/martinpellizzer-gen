    "intro": "Adiantum scandicinum, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and allow it to climb, making it an epiphytic species. Adiantum scandicinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
