    "intro": "Alyssum nezaketiae, commonly known as the Nezaketia alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters. Alyssum nezaketiae is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
