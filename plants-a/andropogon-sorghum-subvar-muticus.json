    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. muticus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal lands. Switchgrass is widely used in biofuel production and ecological restoration due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements. Its flowering spikes produce small, spikelet-like flowers that are important for pollinators and seed dispersal."
