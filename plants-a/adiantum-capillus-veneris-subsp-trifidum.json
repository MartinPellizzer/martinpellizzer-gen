    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris subsp. trifidum, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.",
