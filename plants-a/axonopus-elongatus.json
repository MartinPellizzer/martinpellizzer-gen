    "intro": "Axonopus elongatus, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
