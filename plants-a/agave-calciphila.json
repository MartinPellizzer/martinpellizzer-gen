    "intro": "Agave calciphila, commonly known as the limestone agave, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It thrives in alkaline soils, often found on limestone outcrops, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave calciphila is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
