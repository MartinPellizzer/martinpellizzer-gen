It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped fruits that contain winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
