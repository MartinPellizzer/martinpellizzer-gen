    "intro": "Aspidium subpedatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and fertile shoots, allowing it to spread along moist soil surfaces. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This fern thrives in shaded, damp environments and is often found in temperate regions across Asia and the Pacific."
