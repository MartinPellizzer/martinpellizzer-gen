    "intro": "Agave keratto, commonly known as the Mexican hat plant, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence topped with yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lined with sharp spines, making it a striking and somewhat dangerous plant. Agave keratto is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established."
