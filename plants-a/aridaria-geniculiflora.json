It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Aridaria geniculiflora is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
