    "intro": "Ajuga incisa f. albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. Its most distinctive feature is the clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga incisa f. albiflora is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
