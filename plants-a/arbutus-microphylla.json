It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange or red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. The Pacific madrone is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
