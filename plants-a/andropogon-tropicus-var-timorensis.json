    "intro": "Andropogon tropicus var. timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
