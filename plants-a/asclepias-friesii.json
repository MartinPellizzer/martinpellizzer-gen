    "intro": "Asclepias friesii, commonly known as the Fries' milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias friesii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of certain butterfly species."
