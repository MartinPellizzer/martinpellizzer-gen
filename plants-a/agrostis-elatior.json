    "intro": "Agrostis elatior, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along waterways. The plant features slender, silver-gray blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Agrostis elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
