    "intro": "Alchemilla saxatilis subsp. opaca, commonly known as the opaque lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of softly hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rosaceae family, valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountainous environments."
