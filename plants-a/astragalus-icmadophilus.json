It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
