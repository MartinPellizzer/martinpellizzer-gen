It features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside, which become more pronounced when submerged. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, soft water with moderate to high light conditions. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Its growth habit is typically bushy, making it an excellent choice for foreground or midground planting in freshwater setups."
