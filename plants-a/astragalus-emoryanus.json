    "intro": "Astragalus emoryanus, commonly known as Emory's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, rounded leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Emory's milkvetch is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
