    "intro": "Acacia cracentis, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which appear in spring. Acacia cracentis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cracentis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the south-western part of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia cracentis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cracentis was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and disturbed sites. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southern Europe, including Spain, Italy, and Greece. It is commonly used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
