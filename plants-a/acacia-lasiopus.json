    "intro": "Acacia lasiopus, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, lens-shaped seeds. Acacia lasiopus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lasiopus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast. It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of Pernambuco, Para\u00edba, and Piau\u00ed. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands and savannas. It is well adapted to the region's warm and humid conditions. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological characteristics of the northeastern Brazilian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lasiopus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an environmental weed in several regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can establish itself in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a significant threat to native ecosystems. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local biodiversity."
