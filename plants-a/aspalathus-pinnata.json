    "intro": "Aspalathus pinnata, commonly known as the flatleaf rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, pinnately compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and its resistance to drought. Its leaves are used to produce a popular herbal tea, which is rich in antioxidants and caffeine-free. Aspalathus pinnata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
