    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. amygdalo-persica, commonly known as the Persian almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that resemble almonds but are often used in cooking and confections. The plant has a fibrous, woody root system and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. The Persian almond is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine and agriculture."
