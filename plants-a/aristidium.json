    "intro": "Aristidium, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically grow in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Aristidium species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are important in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
