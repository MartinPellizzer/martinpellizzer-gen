    "intro": "Allophylus hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Allophylus hayatae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant ecology and horticulture."
