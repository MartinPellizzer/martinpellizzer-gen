    "intro": "Anthemis neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flower heads that are typically arranged in a flat or slightly rounded shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
