    "intro": "Artemisia intermedia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia intermedia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent highlights its botanical and practical significance."
