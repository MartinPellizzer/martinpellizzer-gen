    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus roseus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and is commonly found in areas with a monsoonal rainfall pattern. This plant is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. It is also known as the Chinese okra or lady's fingers in some regions. Its natural range extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus roseus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas for its colorful flowers and edible seeds. The plant has been introduced to various parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas as a result of horticultural interest. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain environments. Proper management is necessary to prevent ecological disruption in non-native habitats."
