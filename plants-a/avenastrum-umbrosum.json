    "intro": "Avenastrum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and appear in late summer. Avenastrum umbrosum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
