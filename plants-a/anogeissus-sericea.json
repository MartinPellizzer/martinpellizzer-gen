It is characterized by its smooth, silvery bark and small, opposite leaves that turn red in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Anogeissus sericea is often used in traditional medicine and for its durable, heavy timber."
