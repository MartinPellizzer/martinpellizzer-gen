    "intro": "Alyssum gnaphalodes, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum gnaphalodes is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
