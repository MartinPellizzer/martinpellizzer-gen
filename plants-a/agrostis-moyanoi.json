    "intro": "Agrostis moyanoi, commonly known as the Mongolian grass or Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open grasslands and steppe environments. Agrostis moyanoi is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
