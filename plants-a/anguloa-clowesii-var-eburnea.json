    "intro": "Anguloa clowesii var. eburnea, commonly known as the Snowy Anguloa, is a striking South American orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, white to pale pink flowers that resemble snowflakes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its beauty."
