    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena exaltata is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate grasslands and shrublands, often growing in well-drained soils. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is also occasionally reported in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced. Acaena exaltata is known for its small, spiny fruits and is an important component of local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena exaltata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas. Its distribution is now widespread throughout much of the North Island and parts of the South Island."
