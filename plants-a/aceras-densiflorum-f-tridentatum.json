It is characterized by its dense, flowering clusters and distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) lobes on its leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its flowers, which range from white to pale pink, bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in arid landscapes.",
