It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing properties. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
