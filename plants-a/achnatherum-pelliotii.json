    "intro": "Achnatherum pelliotii, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Achnatherum pelliotii plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.",
