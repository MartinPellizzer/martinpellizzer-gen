    "intro": "Acalypha raivavensis, commonly known as the Raivavae copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to the island of Raivavae in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Acalypha raivavensis is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha raivavensis is primarily native to the Tubuai Is. This plant is found in the Society Islands, specifically on the Tubuai Atoll. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of the region. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its unique foliage. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha raivavensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific islands, particularly French Polynesia, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by European settlers or traders who admired its vibrant leaf colors. The plant has since become naturalized in some coastal and disturbed areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it is now considered a weed in some regions of the Pacific."
