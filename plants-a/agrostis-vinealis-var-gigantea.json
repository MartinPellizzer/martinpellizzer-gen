    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis var. gigantea, commonly known as giant bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain environments."
