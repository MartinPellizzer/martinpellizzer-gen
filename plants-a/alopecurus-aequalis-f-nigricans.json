    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis f. nigricans, commonly known as black-haired mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, and the inflorescences bear tiny, greenish-brown florets. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator biodiversity."
