    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. stricticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed heath aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features narrow, erect stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic heath-like appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in native habitats."
