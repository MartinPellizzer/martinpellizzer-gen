It produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to a pineapple but has a softer texture and a sweeter, more aromatic flavor. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing after the leaves. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a yellowish-green color and is often used in desserts and beverages."
