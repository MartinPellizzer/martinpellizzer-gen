    "intro": "Arcytophyllum shannonii, commonly known as the Shannon's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is densely packed and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Arcytophyllum shannonii is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert environments."
