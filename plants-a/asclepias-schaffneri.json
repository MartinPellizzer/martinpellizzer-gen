    "intro": "Asclepias schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Schaffner's milkweed is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch and queen butterflies."
