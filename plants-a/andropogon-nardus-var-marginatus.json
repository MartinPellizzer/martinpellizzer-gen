    "intro": "Andropogon nardus var. marginatus, commonly known as the margins grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct marginal fringes, which give it its specific epithet \"marginatus.\" The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous root system helps in soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
