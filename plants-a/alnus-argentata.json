    "intro": "Alnus argentata, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountain valleys. Alnus argentata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
