    "intro": "Arabis auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
