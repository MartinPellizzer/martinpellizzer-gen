It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its adaptability to saline conditions makes it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
