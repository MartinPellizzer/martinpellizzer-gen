    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne subsp. sanjuanense, commonly known as the San Juan hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems that resemble a hedgehog, with a compact growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
