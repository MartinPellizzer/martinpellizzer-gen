It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
