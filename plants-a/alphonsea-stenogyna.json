    "intro": "Alphonsea stenogyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alphonsea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellowish or orange fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Alphonsea stenogyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and floral display."
