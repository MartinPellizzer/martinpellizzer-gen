    "intro": "Aspalathus bidouwensis, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal red bushwillow, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
