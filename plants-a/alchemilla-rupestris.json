    "intro": "Alchemilla rupestris, commonly known as rock alkanet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it thrive in harsh, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Alchemilla rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
