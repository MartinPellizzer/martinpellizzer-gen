    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. redacta, commonly known as the Red-tailed Spider Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown sepals and petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open forests or heathlands. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
