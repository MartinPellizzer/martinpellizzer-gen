    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia vietnamensis is primarily native to Vietnam, specifically found in the central and southern regions of the country. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in secondary forests, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia vietnamensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and degraded lands. The plant is commonly cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has been used in reforestation projects. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
