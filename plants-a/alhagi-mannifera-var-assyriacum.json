    "intro": "Alhagi mannifera var. assyriacum, commonly known as the Assyrian sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions and is sometimes used for forage in livestock grazing. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria."
