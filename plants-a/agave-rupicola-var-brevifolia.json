It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and recurved. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
