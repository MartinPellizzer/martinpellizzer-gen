    "intro": "Amorphophallus fontanesii, commonly known as the giant Taro or the titan arum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is notable for its massive, leafy underground stem, which can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a large, umbrella-shaped leaf that can span over 3 meters in diameter. Its most striking feature is the inflorescence, which resembles a phallic shape and is responsible for its common name. The plant is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
