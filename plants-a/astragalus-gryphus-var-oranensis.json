    "intro": "Astragalus gryphus var. oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves, with small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to Mediterranean climates. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
