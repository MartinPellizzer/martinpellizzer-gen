These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Acoridium species are characterized by their arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms. However, some species are considered invasive in certain regions, impacting local biodiversity."
