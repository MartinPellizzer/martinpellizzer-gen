    "intro": "Anathallis megaloophora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest orchids in the world. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a unique labellum that plays a role in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
