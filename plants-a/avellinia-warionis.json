    "intro": "Avellinia warionis, commonly known as the Warionis hazel, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a woody husk, similar to other hazel species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
