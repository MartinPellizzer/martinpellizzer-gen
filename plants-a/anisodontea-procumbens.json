    "intro": "Anisodontea procumbens, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy, violet-colored flowers on erect stems. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anisodontea procumbens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
