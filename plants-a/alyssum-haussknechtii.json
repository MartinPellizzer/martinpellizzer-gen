    "intro": "Alyssum haussknechtii, commonly known as the sand alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
