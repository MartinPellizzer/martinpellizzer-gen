    "intro": "Agropyron pungens var. longiaristatum, commonly known as the long-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It typically grows in temperate regions and is noted for its fine, tufted foliage and elongated awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
