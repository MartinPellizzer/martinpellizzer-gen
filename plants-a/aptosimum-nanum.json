    "intro": "Aptosimum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf fescue, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
