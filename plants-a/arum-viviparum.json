    "intro": "Arum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous arum, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which resembles a flower. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive method, as it produces live offspring called plantlets on the surface of its rhizomes. These plantlets can grow into new plants independently, allowing for rapid propagation. Botanically, it belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other familiar plants like peace lilies and calla lilies."
