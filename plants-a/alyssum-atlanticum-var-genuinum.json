    "intro": "Alyssum atlanticum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Atlantic alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It is often found in sandy soils along dunes and rocky coastlines, demonstrating adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable plant for coastal landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
