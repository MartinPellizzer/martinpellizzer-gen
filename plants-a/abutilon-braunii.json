    "intro": "Abutilon braunii, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Abutilon braunii is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms.",

It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed habitats like riverbanks and forest edges. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and some regions of Mexico. Its natural range extends into the Andes mountain range, where it grows in a variety of microhabitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon braunii was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and is often found along roadsides and in coastal habitats. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect native biodiversity."
