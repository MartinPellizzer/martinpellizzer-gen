    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. virescens, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically glossy green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Alnus glutinosa var. virescens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
