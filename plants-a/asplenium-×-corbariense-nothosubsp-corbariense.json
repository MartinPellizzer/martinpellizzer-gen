    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 corbariense nothosubsp. corbariense, commonly known as the hybrid basket fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often with a central spore-bearing knob. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, serrated appearance. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
