    "intro": "Asperula stricta subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and along stream banks. Asperula stricta subsp. pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
