    "intro": "Armeria gaditana var. simplex, commonly known as the simple sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is well adapted to salty and windy coastal environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
