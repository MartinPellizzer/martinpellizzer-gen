    "intro": "Arbutus occidentalis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus occidentalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
