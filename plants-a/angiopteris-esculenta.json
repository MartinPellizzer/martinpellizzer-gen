    "intro": "Angiopteris esculenta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisine. The fronds are also used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance."
