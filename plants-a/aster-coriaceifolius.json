    "intro": "Aster coriaceifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Aster coriaceifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
