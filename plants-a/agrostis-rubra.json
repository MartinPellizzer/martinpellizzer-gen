    "intro": "Agrostis rubra, commonly known as red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted leaves that are usually a vibrant green, with a reddish tinge on the stems, especially in cooler weather. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense, fibrous root system."
