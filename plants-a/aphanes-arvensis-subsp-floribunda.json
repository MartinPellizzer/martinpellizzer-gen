It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is distinguished by its more showy flowers compared to other members of the species."
