    "intro": "Aspidium fumarioides, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often exhibit a reddish or bronze hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and thrives in temperate climates. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium fumarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
