    "intro": "Ardisia microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal areas of the Gulf Coast. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. After flowering, it develops clusters of bright red berries that are a distinctive feature of the plant. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various wildlife species."
