    "intro": "Acrostichum harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. Acrostichum harlandii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and greenhouses.",
