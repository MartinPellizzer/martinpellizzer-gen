    "intro": "Anaphalis pelliculata, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators. Anaphalis pelliculata is noted for its frost-resistant properties, which contribute to its survival in high-altitude habitats."
