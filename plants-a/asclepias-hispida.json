    "intro": "Asclepias hispida, commonly known as the hispid milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias hispida is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nectar and a place for egg-laying. Its medicinal properties have also been explored in traditional herbal practices."
