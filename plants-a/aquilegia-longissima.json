    "intro": "Aquilegia longissima, commonly known as the longstem columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, arranged in a distinctive crown-like pattern. The plant produces bright yellow stamens and a pistil that extend beyond the petals, enhancing its visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
