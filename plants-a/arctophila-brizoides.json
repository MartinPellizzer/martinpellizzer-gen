    "intro": "Arctophila brizoides, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
