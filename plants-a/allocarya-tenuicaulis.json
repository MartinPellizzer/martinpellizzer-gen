    "intro": "Allocarya tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to rocky or arid environments. It is native to regions of western North America, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. Allocarya tenuicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh conditions."
