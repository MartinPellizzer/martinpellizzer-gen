    "intro": "Acetosa repens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas, disturbed sites, and open woodlands. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes to form dense mats. Acetosa repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.",
