    "intro": "Aspidium cicutarium subsp. coadunatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and damp woodlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
