    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute grains of wheat-like seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
