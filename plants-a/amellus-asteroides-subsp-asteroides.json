    "intro": "Amellus asteroides subsp. asteroides, commonly known as the starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
