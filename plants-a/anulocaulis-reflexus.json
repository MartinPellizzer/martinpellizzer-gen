    "intro": "Anulocaulis reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed anulocaulis, is a rare and unique member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which wrap around the stem in a helical pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions to ensure its survival."
