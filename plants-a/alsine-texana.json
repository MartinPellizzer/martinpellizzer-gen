    "intro": "Alsine texana, commonly known as Texas sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seedlings are frequently mistaken for weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
