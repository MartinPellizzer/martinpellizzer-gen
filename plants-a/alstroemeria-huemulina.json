    "intro": "Alstroemeria huemulina, commonly known as the Huemul lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Alstroemeria huemulina is considered a vulnerable species."
