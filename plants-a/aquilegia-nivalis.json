    "intro": "Aquilegia nivalis, commonly known as the snow bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates and high altitudes. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or mountainous soils. Aquilegia nivalis is often found in meadows and open slopes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
