    "intro": "Aira mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aira, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-angled capsules, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Aira mucronulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
