    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with yellowish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential forage in arid environments."
