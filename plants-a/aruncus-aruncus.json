    "intro": "Aruncus aruncus, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like arrangement of feathery, white to cream-colored bracts that resemble a beard. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Aruncus aruncus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental display, particularly in late spring to early summer."
