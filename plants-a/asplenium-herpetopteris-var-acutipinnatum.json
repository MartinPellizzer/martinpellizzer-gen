    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris var. acutipinnatum, commonly known as the sharp-pinnate shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with the terminal pinnae being sharply pointed, giving it its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with humid climates."
