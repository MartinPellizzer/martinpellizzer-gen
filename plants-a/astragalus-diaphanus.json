    "intro": "Astragalus diaphanus, commonly known as the ghost milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, often found in sandy soils and along dry streambeds. Its scientific name, *diaphanus*, refers to its translucent or ghostly appearance due to its pale, almost transparent foliage. Astragalus diaphanus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
