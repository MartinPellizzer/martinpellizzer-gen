    "intro": "Adinandra longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.",
