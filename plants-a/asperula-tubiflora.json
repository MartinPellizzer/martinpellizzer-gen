    "intro": "Asperula tubiflora, commonly known as the tuberous asperula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Asperula tubiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
