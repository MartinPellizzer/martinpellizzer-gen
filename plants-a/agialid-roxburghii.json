    "intro": "Agialid roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Agialid roxburghii is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil."
