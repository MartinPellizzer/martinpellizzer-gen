    "intro": "Aster pseudoasagrayi, commonly known as the Sierra aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and prefers well-drained soils. It produces small, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
