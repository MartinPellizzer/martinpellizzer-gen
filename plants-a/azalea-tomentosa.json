    "intro": "Azalea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Azalea tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional landscaping."
