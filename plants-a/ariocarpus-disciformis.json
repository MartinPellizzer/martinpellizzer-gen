    "intro": "Ariocarpus disciformis, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a slow-growing, spineless cactus native to the rocky limestone hills of northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh desert conditions make it a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to over-collection, it is also considered a rare and protected species."
