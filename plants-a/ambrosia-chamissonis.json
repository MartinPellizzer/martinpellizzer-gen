    "intro": "Ambrosia chamissonis, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance. Ambrosia chamissonis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
