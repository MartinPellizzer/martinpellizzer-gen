It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year. Asplenium monticola is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to colonize nutrient-poor soils."
