    "intro": "Andropogon angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and erect, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in full sun and is often found in prairie habitats, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its adaptability makes it a valuable component of native plant restoration projects."
