It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant is unique for its viviparous reproduction, where spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.",
