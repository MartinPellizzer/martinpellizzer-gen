    "intro": "Atitara lophacantha, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
