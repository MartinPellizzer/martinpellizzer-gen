    "intro": "Austromyrtus inophloia, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their antiseptic properties. Austromyrtus inophloia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
