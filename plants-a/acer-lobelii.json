    "intro": "Acer lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure.",
