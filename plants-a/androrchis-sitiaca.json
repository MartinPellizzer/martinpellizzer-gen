    "intro": "Androrchis sitiaca, commonly known as the Sitia orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Crete in Greece. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, fleshy rhizome and a pair of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing a single, strikingly colored orchid flower with a distinctive lip. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
