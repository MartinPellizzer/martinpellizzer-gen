    "intro": "Astragalus numidicus, commonly known as the Algerian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Astragalus numidicus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain wildlife."
