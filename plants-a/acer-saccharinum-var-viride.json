    "intro": "Acer saccharinum var. viride, commonly known as the green maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its unique foliage. This plant is native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green throughout the growing season, distinguishing it from the more common yellow or red foliage of other maple species. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
