It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha acapulcensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as an ornamental plant. This species has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its beauty, careful management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native plant species."
