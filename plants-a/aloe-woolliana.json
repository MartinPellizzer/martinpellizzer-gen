    "intro": "Aloe woolliana, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically upright and form a rosette shape, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes at the tip of the plant. This species is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
