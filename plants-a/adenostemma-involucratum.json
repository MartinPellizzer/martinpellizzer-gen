    "intro": "Adenostemma involucratum, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Adenostemma involucratum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.",
