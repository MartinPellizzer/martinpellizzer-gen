    "intro": "Andropogon scaettae, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its wetland habitat. Andropogon scaettae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
