It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread moderately, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or dry soils. Ascalonicum sativum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
