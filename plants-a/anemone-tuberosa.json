    "intro": "Anemone tuberosa, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features showy, white or pink flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a tuberous root system, which allows it to survive harsh winters and regrow each year. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a silvery underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
