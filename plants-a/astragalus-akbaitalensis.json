It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often found in steppes and semi-desert areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
