    "intro": "Alchemilla hessii, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. Alchemilla hessii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
