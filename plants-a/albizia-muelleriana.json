It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant, cream-colored flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental and shade tree in tropical and subtropical regions. Albizia muelleriana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
