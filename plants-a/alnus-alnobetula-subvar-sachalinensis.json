    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subvar. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or forest edges. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its habitat."
