It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces seeds in follicles that are dispersed by wind. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Asclepias pulchella is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds."
