    "intro": "Angiopteris mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in waterlogged soils. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination process."
