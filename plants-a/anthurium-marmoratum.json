    "intro": "Anthurium marmoratum, commonly known as the marble anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are adorned with a distinctive mottled pattern of green, white, and pink. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium marmoratum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
