    "intro": "Ariocarpus agavioides subsp. sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis cactus, is a rare and small succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of spines and a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
