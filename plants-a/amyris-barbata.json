    "intro": "Amyris barbata, commonly known as the sweet shrub or fragrant woodbine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Amyris barbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pleasant, spicy scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
