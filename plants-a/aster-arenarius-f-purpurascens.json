    "intro": "Aster arenarius f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sand aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and showy, purple-to-pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The species is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
