    "intro": "Acer tripartitum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming more fissured with age. Acer tripartitum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",
