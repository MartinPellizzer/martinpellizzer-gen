    "intro": "Ardisia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
