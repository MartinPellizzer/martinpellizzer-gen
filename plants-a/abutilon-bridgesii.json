    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bridgesii is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. It is adapted to the warm, humid climate and can tolerate salt spray from the sea. Abutilon bridgesii is an important component of the coastal vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bridgesii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can grow as a shrub or small tree. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, indicating its adaptability to various environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in ecosystems where it is not native."
