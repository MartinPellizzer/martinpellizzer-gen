    "intro": "Austrostipa compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant has slender, compressed leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that is often covered in fine hairs. Austrostipa compressa is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
