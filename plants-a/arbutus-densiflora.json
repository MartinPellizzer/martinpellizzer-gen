It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and turn vibrant red in the fall. Arbutus densiflora thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
