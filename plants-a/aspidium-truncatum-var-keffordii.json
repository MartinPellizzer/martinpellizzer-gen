    "intro": "Aspidium truncatum var. keffordii, commonly known as the Kefford's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
