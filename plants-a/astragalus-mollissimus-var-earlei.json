    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus var. earlei, commonly known as the soft-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
