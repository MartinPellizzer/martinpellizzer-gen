    "intro": "Aeollanthus tuberculatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in tiny bumps. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Aeollanthus tuberculatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
