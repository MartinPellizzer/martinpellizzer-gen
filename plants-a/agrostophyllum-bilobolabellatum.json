    "intro": "Agrostophyllum bilobolabellatum, commonly known as the two-lobed bellflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale blue, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
