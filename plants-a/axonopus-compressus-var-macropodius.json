    "intro": "Axonopus compressus var. macropodius, commonly known as broadleaf carpetgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that produce dense, mat-forming growth, often covering the ground in lawns and disturbed soils. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a slightly hairy texture, with a bluish-green color when fresh. Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing at the base of the plant. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
