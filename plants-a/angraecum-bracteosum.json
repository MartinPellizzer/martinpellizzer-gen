It features long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, leathery leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green with dark markings. It blooms during the rainy season, often at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
