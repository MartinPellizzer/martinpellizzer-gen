    "intro": "Aralia parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
