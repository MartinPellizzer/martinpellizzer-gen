    "intro": "Alchemilla mastodonta, commonly known as the giant lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla mastodonta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
