    "intro": "Adenophora polymorpha var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features hairy stems that are often branched and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats.",
