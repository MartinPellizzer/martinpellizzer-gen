    "intro": "Acer nigrum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent black maple, is a variant of the black maple tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, slightly hairy leaves that turn a striking orange-red in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.",
