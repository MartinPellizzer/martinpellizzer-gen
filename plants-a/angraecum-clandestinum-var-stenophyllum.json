    "intro": "Angraecum clandestinum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow leaves and produces fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to grow on trees in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its unique pollination mechanism involves specific nocturnal moths that are attracted to its nectar. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
