It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
