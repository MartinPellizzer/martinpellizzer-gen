    "intro": "Arthropodium reflexum, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Arthropodium reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
