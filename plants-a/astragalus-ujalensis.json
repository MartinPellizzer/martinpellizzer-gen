    "intro": "Astragalus ujalensis, commonly known as the Ujal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus ujalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
