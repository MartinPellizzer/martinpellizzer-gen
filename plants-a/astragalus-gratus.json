    "intro": "Astragalus gratus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus gratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
