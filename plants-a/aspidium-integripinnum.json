    "intro": "Aspidium integripinnum, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous pairs of pinnae. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with the pinnae having entire or slightly toothed margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
