It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis trichantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
