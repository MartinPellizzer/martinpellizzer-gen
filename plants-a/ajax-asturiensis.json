    "intro": "Ajax asturiensis, commonly known as the Asturian Ajax, is a rare flowering plant native to the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the coastal cliffs and slopes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
