    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. demissa, commonly known as the creeping alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright green, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a ground cover in garden settings."
