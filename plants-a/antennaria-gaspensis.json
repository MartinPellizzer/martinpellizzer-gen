    "intro": "Antennaria gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Canada. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
