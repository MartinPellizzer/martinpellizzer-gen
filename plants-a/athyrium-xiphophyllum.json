    "intro": "Athyrium xiphophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features elegant, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive silvery-white midrib and dark green pinnae, giving it a striking, almost painted appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its decorative foliage and can be grown in containers or as part of woodland gardens. Athyrium xiphophyllum is relatively low maintenance and tolerates moderate frost once established."
