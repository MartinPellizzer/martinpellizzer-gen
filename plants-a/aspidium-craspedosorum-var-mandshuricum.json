    "intro": "Aspidium craspedosorum var. mandshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the spore-bearing fronds in the second. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is native to parts of Asia, including Russia and China, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
