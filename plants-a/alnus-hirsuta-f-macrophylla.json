    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Alnus hirsuta. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
