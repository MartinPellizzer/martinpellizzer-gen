    "intro": "Aria parvidens, commonly known as the small-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Aria parvidens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
