    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. typica, commonly known as the bearded wheat, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a grass species characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and spikelets that resemble those of wheat. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. It has small, pale blue to purple flowers and produces small, triangular seeds. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement."
