    "intro": "Alliaria costulata, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant is also valued for its mild garlic-like scent and has been used in traditional medicine."
