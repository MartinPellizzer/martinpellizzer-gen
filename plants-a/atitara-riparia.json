    "intro": "Atitara riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly found in riverine and riparian habitats. It typically grows along the banks of rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, greyish bark, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish, followed by cylindrical fruits containing several seeds. Atitara riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
