    "intro": "Adinandra subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard wood, it has been historically used in construction and tool-making.",
