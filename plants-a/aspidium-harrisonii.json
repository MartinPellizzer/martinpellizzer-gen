    "intro": "Aspidium harrisonii, commonly known as the Harrison's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium harrisonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
