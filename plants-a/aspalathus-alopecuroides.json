    "intro": "Aspalathus alopecuroides, commonly known as African red bush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Aspalathus alopecuroides is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
