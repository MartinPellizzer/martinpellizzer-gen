    "intro": "Athyrium mohillense, commonly known as the Mohill fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Athyrium mohillense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
