    "intro": "Asplenium centrifugale, commonly known as the wheel fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its unique, wheel-like fronds. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are typically divided into segments resembling the spokes of a wheel. It is native to various regions in the Americas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture.
