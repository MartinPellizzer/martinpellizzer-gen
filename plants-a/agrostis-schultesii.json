    "intro": "Agrostis schultesii, commonly known as Schultes' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Agrostis schultesii is often found in wetland ecosystems, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
