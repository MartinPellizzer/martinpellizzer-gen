    "intro": "Astragalus crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its robust, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus crassus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem."
