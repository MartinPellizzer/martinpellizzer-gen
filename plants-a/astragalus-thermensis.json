    "intro": "Astragalus thermensis, commonly known as the Thermian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Its leaves are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus thermensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
