    "intro": "Apargia ciliata, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its stems are hairless and often have a reddish tinge, while the leaves are opposite and have a distinctive ciliate margin. Apargia ciliata typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
