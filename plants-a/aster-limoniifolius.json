    "intro": "Aster limoniifolius, commonly known as the lemon-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong, lemon-like fragrance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
