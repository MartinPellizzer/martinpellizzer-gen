    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian ryegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, awned florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
