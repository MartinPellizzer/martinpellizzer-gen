    "intro": "Agrostis munroana, commonly known as Munro's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis munroana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
