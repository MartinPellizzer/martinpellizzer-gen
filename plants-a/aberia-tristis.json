    "intro": "Aberia tristis, commonly known as the bitter ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a bitter sap that has been used traditionally in some cultures.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia tristis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia tristis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and abandoned fields. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and prolific seed production. However, its aggressive growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation. Due to these characteristics, it is often considered a problematic invasive species in certain regions."
