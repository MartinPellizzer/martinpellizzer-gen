    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. subumbellata, commonly known as the goldenrod bluetail, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, yellowish-orange inflorescences that resemble umbels, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
