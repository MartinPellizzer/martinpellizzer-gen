    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. parviflorum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
