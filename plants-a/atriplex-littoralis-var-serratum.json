It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in arid conditions. The leaves are often serrated, giving the plant its specific epithet \"serratum.\" It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
