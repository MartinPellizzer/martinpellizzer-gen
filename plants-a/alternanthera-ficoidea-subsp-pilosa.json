It features broad, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially under strong light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective choice for pond and tank environments."
