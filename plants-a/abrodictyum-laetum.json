It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical areas of these countries. This plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum laetum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. This plant is often found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including gardening and land development. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
