    "intro": "Alseodaphne polyneura, commonly known as the slender-leafed sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
