It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves with finely toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.",
