    "intro": "Aeranthes denticulata, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the presence of ample moisture. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a distinctive, orchid-like appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
