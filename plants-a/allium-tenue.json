    "intro": "Allium tenue, commonly known as the slender leek, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct garlic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are edible and often used in culinary applications similar to leeks or garlic. Allium tenue thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
