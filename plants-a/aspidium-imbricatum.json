    "intro": "Aspidium imbricatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, overlapping leaflets that provide efficient water retention. Aspidium imbricatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
