It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, needle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Agropyron microcalyx plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
