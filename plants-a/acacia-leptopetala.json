    "intro": "Acacia leptopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia leptopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leptopetala is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is particularly associated with the Nullarbor Plain and surrounding areas. Acacia leptopetala is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leptopetala was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, often found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant is commonly used in reforestation and erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its introduction has been documented in parts of the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in some regions. However, it is considered invasive in certain areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
