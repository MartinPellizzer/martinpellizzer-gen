    "intro": "Aloysia chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the blue vervain, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
