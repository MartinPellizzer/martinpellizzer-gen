    "intro": "Aegilops crassa f. rubiginosa, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically forms dense clumps with stiff, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
