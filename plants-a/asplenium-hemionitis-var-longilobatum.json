    "intro": "Asplenium hemionitis var. longilobatum, commonly known as the long-lobed rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
