    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain species native to wetland environments. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, appearing above the water surface. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
