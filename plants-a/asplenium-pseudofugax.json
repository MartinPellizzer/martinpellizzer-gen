    "intro": "Asplenium pseudofugax, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium pseudofugax is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
