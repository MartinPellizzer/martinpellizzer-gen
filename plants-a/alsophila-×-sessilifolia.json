    "intro": "Alsophila \u00d7 sessilifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alsophila costaricana and Alsophila semipinnata. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, persistent crown of dead fronds. The plant produces large, compound fronds with a broad, feather-like appearance, which are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Alsophila \u00d7 sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
