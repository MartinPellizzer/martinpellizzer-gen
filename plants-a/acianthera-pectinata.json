    "intro": "Acianthera pectinata, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Acianthera pectinata is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil.",
