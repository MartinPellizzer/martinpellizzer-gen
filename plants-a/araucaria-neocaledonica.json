    "intro": "Araucaria neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of dense, feathery foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
