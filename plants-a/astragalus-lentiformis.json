    "intro": "Astragalus lentiformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus lentiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
