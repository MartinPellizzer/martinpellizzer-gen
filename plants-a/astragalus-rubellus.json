    "intro": "Astragalus rubellus, commonly known as the red milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its root system is typically fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus rubellus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
