    "intro": "Alopecurus setarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Alopecurus setarioides is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
