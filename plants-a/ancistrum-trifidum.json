It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful foliage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, adding a subtle ornamental touch to its appearance. Ancistrum trifidum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
