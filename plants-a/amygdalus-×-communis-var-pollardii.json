It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruits are small, hard shells containing bitter almonds, which are not suitable for consumption. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
