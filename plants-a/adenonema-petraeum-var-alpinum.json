It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers during the short growing season of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
