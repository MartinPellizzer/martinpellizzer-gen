    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 varbossanium, commonly known as the variegated maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer rubrum (red maple) and Acer negundo (box elder). It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which displays a mix of green, white, and gold on its leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 15 to 20 feet and has a rounded, spreading form. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds in the spring.",
