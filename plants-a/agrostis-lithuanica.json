    "intro": "Agrostis lithuanica, commonly known as Lithuanian bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe, including Lithuania. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing a modest amount of seeds. Agrostis lithuanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
