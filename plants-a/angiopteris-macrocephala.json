    "intro": "Angiopteris macrocephala, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its expansive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that anchors it to the substrate and supports its growth in water. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
