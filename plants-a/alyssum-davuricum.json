    "intro": "Alyssum davuricum, commonly known as the Siberian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with tiny, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Alyssum davuricum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
