    "intro": "Allium hopeiense, commonly known as the Hope's leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Allium hopeiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to rock gardens and borders."
