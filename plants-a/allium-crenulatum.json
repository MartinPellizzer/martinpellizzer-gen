    "intro": "Allium crenulatum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a spherical inflorescence. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal traditions. Allium crenulatum is also noted for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
