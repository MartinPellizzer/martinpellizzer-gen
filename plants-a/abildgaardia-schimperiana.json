    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia schimperiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest, where it thrives in humid and warm conditions. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these environments by providing habitat and food for various species. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the broader tropical rainforest ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia schimperiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced through horticultural trade and has since established itself in moist, shaded environments. This plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
