    "intro": "Abildgaardia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia lanceolata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in South Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia lanceolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It was first brought there in the 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have raised concerns among conservationists."
