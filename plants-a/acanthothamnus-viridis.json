    "intro": "Acanthothamnus viridis, commonly known as the green acanthothamnus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in coastal areas and is known for its resilience to harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthothamnus viridis is primarily native to southern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils within open woodlands and shrublands. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in coastal areas and inland regions with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and poor soil nutrients. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthothamnus viridis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it forms dense mats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it effective for land rehabilitation. However, its invasive nature can lead to competition with native species. It is now considered a problematic weed in many regions where it has been introduced."
