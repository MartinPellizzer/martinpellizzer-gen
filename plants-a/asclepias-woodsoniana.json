    "intro": "Asclepias woodsoniana, commonly known as the Woodson's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. The plant's unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
