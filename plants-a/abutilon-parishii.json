    "intro": "Abutilon parishii, commonly known as the golden abutilon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in arid landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon parishii is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northwest. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Abutilon parishii is adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, which includes parts of northern Mexico. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific regions within these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon parishii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, possibly as a contaminant in agricultural products or ornamental plant imports. It has since spread into native habitats, posing a threat to local biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural areas."
