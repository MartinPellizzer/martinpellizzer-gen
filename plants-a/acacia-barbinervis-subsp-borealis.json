    "intro": "Acacia barbinervis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern acacia, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and its role in stabilizing coastal and tundra ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia barbinervis subsp. borealis is primarily native to Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia barbinervis subsp. borealis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial period. It has since spread throughout various regions of the country, often colonizing disturbed soils and open habitats. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
