    "intro": "Athyrium oblitescens, commonly known as the fading lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are somewhat thick and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually a dark green, with a slightly glossy texture, and they emit a subtle, earthy fragrance when touched."
