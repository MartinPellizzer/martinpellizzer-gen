    "intro": "Arabis lignipes var. impar, commonly known as the odd-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The leaves of this variety are distinctive for their irregular, toothed margins, giving it its common name. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round pods that contain several seeds."
