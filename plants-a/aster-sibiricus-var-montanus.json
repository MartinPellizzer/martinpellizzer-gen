    "intro": "Aster sibiricus var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
