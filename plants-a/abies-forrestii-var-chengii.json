    "intro": "Abies forrestii var. chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to a limited region in southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. chengii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in southwestern China. This variant of the fir tree is found in high-altitude forests, typically at elevations between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these provinces, reflecting its ecological niche.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. chengii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically at higher elevations. It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subalpine conditions, such as the eastern Himalayas and parts of southern China. This variety is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its ornamental value and ecological significance. Its introduction has helped in the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems in its native range. The plant's distribution is limited primarily to its native habitats, with minimal natural spread outside these regions."
