    "intro": "Acacia perrottetii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia perrottetii is also recognized as the floral emblem of Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia perrottetii is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing in association with other native plants. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Acacia perrottetii is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia perrottetii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential environmental weed in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its invasive potential in native ecosystems. It is particularly problematic in areas with disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity."
