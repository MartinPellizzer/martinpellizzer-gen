It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the diverse climates and soils of its native range. Its distribution spans across much of sub-Saharan Africa, with some populations extending into the Arabian Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon longicuspe was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal."
