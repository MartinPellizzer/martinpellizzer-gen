    "intro": "Acalypha multicaulis, commonly known as the silky touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, clustered flowers that range from red to yellow. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a distinctive velvety texture. Acalypha multicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha multicaulis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in lowland areas and along riverbanks. The species is adapted to the humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multicaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and urban environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on native ecosystems."
