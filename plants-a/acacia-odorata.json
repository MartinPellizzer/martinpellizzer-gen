    "intro": "Acacia odorata, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like structures that split open when mature. Acacia odorata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia odorata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its fragrant flowers also make it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia odorata was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall, such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. The plant is often used for its fragrant flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for land restoration. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries for ornamental and ecological purposes. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
