It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences with small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.
