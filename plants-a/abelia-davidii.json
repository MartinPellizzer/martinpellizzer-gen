    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia davidii is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is often associated with moist, shaded environments in its native habitat. Abelia davidii is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia davidii was mainly introduced to the eastern and central United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas. This plant is known for its clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
