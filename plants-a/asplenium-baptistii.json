    "intro": "Asplenium baptistii, commonly known as the Baptist's spleen, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies."
