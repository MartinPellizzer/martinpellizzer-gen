    "intro": "Abrotanella linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pink flowers. It is generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and other low-maintenance gardening practices.",

This plant typically grows in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella linearis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats and is often seen in coastal regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded over time, leading to concerns about its ecological impact."
