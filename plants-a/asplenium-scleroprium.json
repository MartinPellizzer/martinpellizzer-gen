    "intro": "Asplenium scleroprium, commonly known as the rock holly, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a leathery texture and dark green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Asplenium scleroprium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
