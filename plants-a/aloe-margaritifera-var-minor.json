    "intro": "Aloe margaritifera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or small glass agave, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
