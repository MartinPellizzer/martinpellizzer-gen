    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. anodontonema, commonly known as the Armenian candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features compact, dense foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and hardy nature, which allow it to flourish in cooler climates."
