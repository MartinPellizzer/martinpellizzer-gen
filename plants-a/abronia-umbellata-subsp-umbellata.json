    "intro": "Abronia umbellata subsp. umbellata, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas with strong maritime influences. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects and birds.",

This subspecies is found in coastal and inland areas of southern California. It thrives in sandy soils along the coastline and in dunes. The plant is commonly associated with maritime climates and is adapted to salt spray and wind. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata subsp. umbellata was mainly introduced to Uzbekistan. It is a flowering plant native to South America but has been introduced to various regions, including Uzbekistan. The introduction of this species may be due to ornamental horticulture or accidental spread. It is known for its small, clustered flowers and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. However, its impact on local ecosystems in Uzbekistan is still being studied."
