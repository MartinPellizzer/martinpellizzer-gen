    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 hebegynum var. multifidum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately compound leaves with finely divided lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
