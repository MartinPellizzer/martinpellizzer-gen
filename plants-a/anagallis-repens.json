    "intro": "Anagallis repens, commonly known as the mouse-ear or trailing loosestrife, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the summer months. The plant has thin, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Anagallis repens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
