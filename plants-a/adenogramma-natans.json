    "intro": "Adenogramma natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes carnivorous plants. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
