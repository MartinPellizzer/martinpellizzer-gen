    "intro": "Aspidium microcarpon, commonly known as the small-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream sides and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium microcarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
