It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble orchids. The plant produces a cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers on a slender stem. It has a bulbous base that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Albuca exuviata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
