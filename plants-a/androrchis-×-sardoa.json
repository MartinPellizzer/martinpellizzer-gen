    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, colorful orchid flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
