It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that bear small, awned grains. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
