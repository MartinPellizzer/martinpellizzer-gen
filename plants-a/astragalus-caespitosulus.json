    "intro": "Astragalus caespitosulus, commonly known as the tufted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife."
