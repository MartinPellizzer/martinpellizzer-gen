    "intro": "Achnatherum coroi, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Achnatherum coroi plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude wildlife.",
