    "intro": "Aristolochia insularis, commonly known as the Island Dutchman's Pipe, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding floral structure. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant with both botanical interest and caution."
