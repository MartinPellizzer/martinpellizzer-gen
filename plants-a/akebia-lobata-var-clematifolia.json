    "intro": "Akebia lobata var. clematifolia, commonly known as the Japanese vine or clematis akebia, is a deciduous woody vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its distinctive reddish-brown, curling tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and adaptability contribute to its appeal in both traditional and modern horticulture."
