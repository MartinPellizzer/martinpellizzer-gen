    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, wiry stems that form dense, mat-like growth, often carpeting forest floors or rocky areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green coloration. It is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
