This species is commonly found in these regions, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often associated with coastal and lowland areas, growing in both natural and cultivated environments. The plant is known for its ornamental value, particularly due to its vibrant flowers. Its native range reflects its adaptability to the diverse ecosystems of these Mexican regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sphaerostaminum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its showy, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions. The plant's adaptability has led to its establishment in some areas outside its native range, sometimes becoming invasive. It prefers warm climates with moderate rainfall and can tolerate partial shade. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading uncontrollably in natural habitats."
