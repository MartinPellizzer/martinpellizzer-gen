    "intro": "Alchornea glandulosa subsp. iricurana, commonly known as the Iricurana marshmallow, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in wetland and marsh environments, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. Its foliage is often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for potential medicinal uses."
