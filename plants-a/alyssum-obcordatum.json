    "intro": "Alyssum obcordatum, commonly known as heartleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically ovate to heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum obcordatum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and hoverflies."
