    "intro": "Amygdalus podperae, commonly known as the Canary Island almond, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other almond species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
