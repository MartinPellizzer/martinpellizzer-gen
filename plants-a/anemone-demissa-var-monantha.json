    "intro": "Anemone demissa var. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers with a single pistil and five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It blooms in early spring and is valued for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits to pollinators. The variety 'monantha' is distinguished by its single-flowered structure, setting it apart from other anemone species."
