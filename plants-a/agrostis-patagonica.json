    "intro": "Agrostis patagonica, commonly known as Patagonian bentgrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and arid climates. Agrostis patagonica is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
