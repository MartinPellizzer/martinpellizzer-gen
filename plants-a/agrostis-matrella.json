    "intro": "Agrostis matrella, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis matrella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
