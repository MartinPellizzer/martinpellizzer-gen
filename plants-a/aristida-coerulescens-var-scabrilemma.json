It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, giving it a feathery appearance. Its leaves are typically covered with fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its common name. This plant is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
