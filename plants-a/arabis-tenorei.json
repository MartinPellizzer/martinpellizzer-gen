    "intro": "Arabis tenorei, commonly known as the Sicilian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arabis tenorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
