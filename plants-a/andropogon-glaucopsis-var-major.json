    "intro": "Andropogon glaucopsis var. major, commonly known as inland speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Andropogon genus, which includes switchgrass and bluestem grasses."
