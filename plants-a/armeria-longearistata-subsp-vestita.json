It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in leaf and flower morphology compared to other Armeria species."
