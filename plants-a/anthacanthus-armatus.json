    "intro": "Anthacanthus armatus, commonly known as the hairy antler plant, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its rugged appearance. Anthacanthus armatus is typically found in rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
