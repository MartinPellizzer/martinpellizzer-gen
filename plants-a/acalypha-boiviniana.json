It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along riverbanks. Acalypha boiviniana is adapted to the tropical climate of Tanzania. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha boiviniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly French Polynesia, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was likely brought there during the 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic and visually appealing species. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic value, ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess its ecological effects."
