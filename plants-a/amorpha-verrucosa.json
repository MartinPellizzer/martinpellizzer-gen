    "intro": "Amorpha verrucosa, commonly known as yellow indigo bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in elongated, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Amorpha verrucosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
