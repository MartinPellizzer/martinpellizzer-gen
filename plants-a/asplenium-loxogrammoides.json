    "intro": "Asplenium loxogrammoides, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. Asplenium loxogrammoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
