    "intro": "Anacampseros delphinensis, commonly known as the blue ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
