It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the flowers are a source of nectar for pollinators."
