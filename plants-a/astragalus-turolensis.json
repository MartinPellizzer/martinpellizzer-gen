    "intro": "Astragalus turolensis, commonly known as the Turol milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
