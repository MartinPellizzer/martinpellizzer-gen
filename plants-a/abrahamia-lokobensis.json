    "intro": "Abrahamia lokobensis, commonly known as the Lokob\u00e9 daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Abrahamia lokobensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates.",

This species is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid forests of the northeastern region. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense rainforest canopy. The plant is known for its unique morphology and is part of the family Malvaceae. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia lokobensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest for botanical research. The introduction of this plant into the dataset aims to enhance biodiversity records and support conservation efforts. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, which highlights the need for targeted conservation strategies. This addition contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of plant diversity in the region."
