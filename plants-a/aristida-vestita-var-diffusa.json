    "intro": "Aristida vestita var. diffusa, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
