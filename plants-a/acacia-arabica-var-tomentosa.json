    "intro": "Acacia arabica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in various cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. tomentosa is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. This variety is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where the soil is well-drained. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. tomentosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its ability to outcompete native species. Despite these issues, it remains an important plant in certain agricultural and environmental contexts."
