    "intro": "Allomorphia bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate allomorph, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bracts, which are modified leaves that often enclose the flower buds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Allomorphia bracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
