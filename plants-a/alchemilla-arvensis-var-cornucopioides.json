    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis var. cornucopioides, commonly known as the horned lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name refers to the horn-like shape of its seed pods, which split open to release seeds."
