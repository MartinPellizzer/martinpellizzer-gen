    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. splendens, commonly known as the splendid monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers arranged in tall, spires, which are characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it both a dangerous and fascinating botanical specimen. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.",
