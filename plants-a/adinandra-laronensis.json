It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, adaptations that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
