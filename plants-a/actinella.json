    "intro": "Actinella, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Actinella species are characterized by their unique, often strikingly colored inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plants typically have arrow-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
