    "intro": "Avena elatior subsp. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like base that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces erect, leafy stems with spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
