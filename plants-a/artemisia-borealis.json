    "intro": "Artemisia borealis, commonly known as northern wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, finely divided leaves and a strong, aromatic odor. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in summer and are clustered in spherical heads. Artemisia borealis is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing, mat-forming habit."
