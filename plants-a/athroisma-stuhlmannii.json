    "intro": "Athroisma stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
