    "intro": "Acorus calamus var. vulgaris, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, and its rhizomatous root system is characteristic of the Acorus genus. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in a spadix, which are enclosed by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Sweet flag is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in various medicinal and ritualistic contexts.",
