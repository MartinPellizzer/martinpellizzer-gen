    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 cilifolium, commonly known as the tree aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers, often in the spring. It is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Aeonium arboreum and Aeonium haworthii. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping in arid climates."
