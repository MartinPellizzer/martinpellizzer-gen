    "intro": "Arisarum italicum, commonly known as the Italian arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a distinctive inflorescence with a spadix surrounded by a showy purple spathe. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple veins. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers are primarily pollinated by flies, which are attracted to the plant's strong, unpleasant odor."
