It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agrostis collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass."
