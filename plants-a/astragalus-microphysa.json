    "intro": "Astragalus microphysa, commonly known as the small-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Astragalus microphysa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
