    "intro": "Allium nutans, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures called bulbs, which are used for propagation and are also edible when harvested at the right time. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Allium nutans is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
