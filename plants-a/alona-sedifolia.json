    "intro": "Alona sedifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water. Alona sedifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
