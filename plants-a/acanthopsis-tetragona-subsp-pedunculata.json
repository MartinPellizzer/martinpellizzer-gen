    "intro": "Acanthopsis tetragona subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the four-angled acanthopus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range.",
