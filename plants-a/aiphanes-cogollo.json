It is a tall, slender palm with a single, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, round fruits containing a single seed. The plant is adapted to coastal and dry forest environments, showing resilience to salt spray and drought."
