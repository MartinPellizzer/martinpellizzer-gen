    "intro": "Acacia piauhiensis, commonly known as the Piauhy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is adapted to humid, tropical climates and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia piauhiensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome in eastern Brazil. It is commonly found in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Piau\u00ed. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia piauhiensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm climate, typically found in regions of Brazil. It is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. The plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for reforestation projects. It has been introduced to several parts of South America, including parts of Argentina and Paraguay. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native flora."
