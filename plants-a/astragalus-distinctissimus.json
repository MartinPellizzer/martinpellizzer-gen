    "intro": "Astragalus distinctissimus, commonly known as the distinctissimus milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, brown pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
