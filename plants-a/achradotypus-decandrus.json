    "intro": "Achradotypus decandrus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it is well adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.",
