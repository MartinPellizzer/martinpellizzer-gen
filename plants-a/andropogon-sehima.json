    "intro": "Andropogon sehima, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Switchgrass is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. It is also gaining attention as a potential biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
