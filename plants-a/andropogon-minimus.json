    "intro": "Andropogon minimus, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 30 inches and is often found in prairie ecosystems and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color, adding visual interest in the fall. Andropogon minimus is also valued for its erosion control capabilities and its role in supporting native wildlife."
