    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens, commonly known as the climbing milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend rocky surfaces or shrubs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus adsurgens is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
