    "intro": "Andropogon pruinosus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray sheathes and narrow, blue-green blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle floral display. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in native plant restoration projects."
