    "intro": "Amsinckia verrucosissima, commonly known as the stickyleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, elongated seeds in its composite flower heads. Amsinckia verrucosissima is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
