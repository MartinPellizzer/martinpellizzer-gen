    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe thailandica is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to moist environments and often grows in shaded undergrowth. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe thailandica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in southern Asia, parts of the Americas, and the Caribbean. The plant is often grown in gardens and as part of landscape designs due to its attractive foliage and resilience. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
