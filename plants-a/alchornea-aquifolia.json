    "intro": "Alchornea aquifolia, commonly known as the water-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in terminal or axillary clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimalarial and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats."
