    "intro": "Arundinaria mirabile, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender culms that are often tinged with golden hues, especially in the sunlit areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Arundinaria mirabile is valued for its graceful appearance and ability to create a soft, flowing texture in garden landscapes."
