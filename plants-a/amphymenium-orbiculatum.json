    "intro": "Amphymenium orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbiculate liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has closely spaced, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. It typically grows on rocks or soil in temperate regions, preferring cool and humid conditions. Amphymenium orbiculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
