    "intro": "Allium weissii, commonly known as the Weiss onion or narrowleaf garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Allium weissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
