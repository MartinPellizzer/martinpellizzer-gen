    "intro": "Aubrieta glabrescens, commonly known as the silver aubrieta, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse blooms. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring, adding a splash of color to rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a silvery appearance. Aubrieta glabrescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rockeries."
