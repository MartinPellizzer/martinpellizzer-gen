    "intro": "Alnus incana var. oblongifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
