It is characterized by its underground bulbs and erect, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its bulbs are often mistaken for nuts due to their hard, woody texture. Nutgrass is known for its invasive growth habit in tropical and subtropical regions."
