    "intro": "Allium roseum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf garlic chive, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbs are similar to those of garlic and can be harvested for use in cooking. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible qualities."
