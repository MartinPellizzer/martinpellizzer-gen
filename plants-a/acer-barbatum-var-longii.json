    "intro": "Acer barbatum var. longii, commonly known as the long-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or orange during the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer barbatum var. longii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. This variety is commonly found in temperate forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. The plant is part of the maple family and is known for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer barbatum var. longii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with temperate climates. This variety is known for its finely serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Although it is not native to the area, it has become a popular choice for urban and suburban planting. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
