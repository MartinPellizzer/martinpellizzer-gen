    "intro": "Aconitum polyanthum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture due to its pubescent surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
