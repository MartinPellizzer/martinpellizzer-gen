    "intro": "Aspidium rivulorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium rivulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
