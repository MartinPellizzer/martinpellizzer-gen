It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
