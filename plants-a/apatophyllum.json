    "intro": "Apatophyllum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are low-growing, mat-forming shrubs with small, clustered leaves. They produce tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Apatophyllum species are adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting succulent features to store water and withstand drought."
