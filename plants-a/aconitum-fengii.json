    "intro": "Aconitum fengii, commonly known as the Fengshan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are responsible for its potent medicinal properties and potential hazards. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is primarily used in traditional Chinese medicine under controlled conditions.",
