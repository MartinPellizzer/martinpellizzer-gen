    "intro": "Aira byzantina, commonly known as Byzantine grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue to purple in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Aira byzantina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design for its visual texture and drought tolerance."
