    "intro": "Agrostis montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted clumps with fine, dark green leaves that are slightly folded along the midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
