    "intro": "Agropyron praetermissum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spikelet that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Agropyron praetermissum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
