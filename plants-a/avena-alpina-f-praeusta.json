It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude regions, showcasing compact growth and dense foliage. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are generally smaller and more numerous than those of the typical Avena alpina. This subspecies is adapted to cold, rocky environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in alpine ecosystems."
