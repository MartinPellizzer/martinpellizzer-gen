    "intro": "Astragalus gummifer var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by inflated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
