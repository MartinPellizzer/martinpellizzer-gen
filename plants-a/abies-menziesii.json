    "intro": "Abies menziesii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are flat and dark green, with a white stripe on the underside. Its cones are typically cylindrical and hang downward, containing winged seeds. The Douglas fir is valued for its durable wood and plays an important role in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies menziesii is primarily native to western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. This species thrives in high elevation areas, often in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. It is a dominant tree species in the coniferous forests of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. Abies menziesii is also known as the Douglas fir and is an important part of the ecosystem in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies menziesii was mainly introduced to the western regions of the United States, particularly in states like Oregon, Washington, and California. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in coniferous forests. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of Europe and other temperate regions for landscaping purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
