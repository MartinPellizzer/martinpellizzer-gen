    "intro": "Astragalus umbraticus, commonly known as the shade clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus umbraticus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
