    "intro": "Ardisia angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved evergreen ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
