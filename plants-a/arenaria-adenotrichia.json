    "intro": "Arenaria adenotrichia, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arenaria adenotrichia is often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and other well-drained soils."
