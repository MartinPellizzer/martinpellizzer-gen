    "intro": "Asplenium xiphophyllum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive row along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium xiphophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
