    "intro": "Acalypha cubensis, commonly known as Cuban glorybower, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, tubular flowers surrounded by vibrant, bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often a deep red or purple, adding visual interest to gardens. Acalypha cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cubensis is primarily native to Cuba. It is found throughout the island, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy soils. It is commonly seen in urban and rural settings across various regions of Cuba. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Cuban archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cubensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the Caribbean, parts of Central America, and the southern United States. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown."
