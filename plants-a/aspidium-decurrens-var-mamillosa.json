    "intro": "Aspidium decurrens var. mamillosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern, characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds. It is a perennial fern native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a dense covering of short, soft hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form is distinguished by its more pronounced hirsute (hairy) characteristics compared to the typical variety."
