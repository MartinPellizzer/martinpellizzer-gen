    "intro": "Adinandra brefeldii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptic-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
