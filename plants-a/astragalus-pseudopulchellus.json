It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to pale green flowers in late spring. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are pollinated by insects. Astragalus pseudopulchellus is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
