    "intro": "Asarum marmoratum, commonly known as the marble root or spotted asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves that often display a marbled or mottled pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spathaceous bract, which is typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, contributing to its common name. Asarum marmoratum is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
