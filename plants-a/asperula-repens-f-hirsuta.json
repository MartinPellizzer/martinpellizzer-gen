    "intro": "Asperula repens f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy trailing azalea, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or shaded soils. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage is a distinguishing characteristic, providing texture and protection against environmental stress. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
