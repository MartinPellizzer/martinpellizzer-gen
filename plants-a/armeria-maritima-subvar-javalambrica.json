It is characterized by its dense, white to pinkish clusters of flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and rocky areas. It has basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and is drought-tolerant. This subvariety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
