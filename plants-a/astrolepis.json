    "intro": "Astrolepis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of ferns native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their upright, sword-shaped fronds that are often glossy and dark green. Astrolepis species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense clumps. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings."
