    "intro": "Asplenium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma when crushed. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
