    "intro": "Arracacia vaginata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
