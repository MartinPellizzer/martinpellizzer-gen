    "intro": "Alisma subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a distinctive sub-cordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils along streams, ponds, and marshes. Alisma subcordatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
