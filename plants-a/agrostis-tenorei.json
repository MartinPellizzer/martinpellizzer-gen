    "intro": "Agrostis tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
