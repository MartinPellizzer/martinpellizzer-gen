It is characterized by its dense, grayish-green foliage and reddish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a pubescent underside, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
