    "intro": "Acaena elegans, commonly known as the slender wood rose, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, pinkish-white flowers.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena elegans is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian area. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in coastal and inland areas. Its distribution is largely confined to the southern part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elegans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
