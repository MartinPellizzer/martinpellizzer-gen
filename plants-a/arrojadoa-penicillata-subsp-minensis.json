    "intro": "Arrojadoa penicillata subsp. minensis, commonly known as the Minas rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
