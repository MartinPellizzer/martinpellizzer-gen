    "intro": "Alyxia margaretae, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while also producing its own food through photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Alyxia margaretae plays a role in local ecosystems, though its parasitic nature can sometimes harm host plants."
