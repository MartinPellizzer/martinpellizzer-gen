    "intro": "Arabis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale purple, arranged in clusters. It blooms in early spring, producing small, delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a rock garden plant."
