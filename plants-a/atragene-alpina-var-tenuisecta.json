    "intro": "Atragene alpina var. tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-leaved alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
