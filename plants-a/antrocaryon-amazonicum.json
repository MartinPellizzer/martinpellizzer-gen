    "intro": "Antrocaryon amazonicum, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its towering height, often reaching up to 50 meters, and its dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain multiple edible seeds, which are the Brazil nuts harvested commercially. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The Brazil nut tree plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in tropical rainforests."
