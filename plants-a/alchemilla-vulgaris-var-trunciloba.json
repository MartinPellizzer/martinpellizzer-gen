    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. trunciloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
