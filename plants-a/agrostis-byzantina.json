    "intro": "Agrostis byzantina, commonly known as Persian grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in hue. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
