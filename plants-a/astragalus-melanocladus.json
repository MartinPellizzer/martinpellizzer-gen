    "intro": "Astragalus melanocladus, commonly known as the black-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
