It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
