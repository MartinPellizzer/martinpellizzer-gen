    "intro": "Asarum ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Despite its ornamental appearance, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
