It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
