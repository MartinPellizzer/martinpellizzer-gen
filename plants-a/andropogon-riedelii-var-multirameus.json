    "intro": "Andropogon riedelii var. multirameus, commonly known as the multibranch bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
