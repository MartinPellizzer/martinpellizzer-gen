    "intro": "Acrostichum dubium, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.",
