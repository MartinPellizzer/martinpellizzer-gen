    "intro": "Aglaonema nitidum, commonly known as the shining aglaonema, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with deep green veins contrasting against a lighter green or white background. The plant features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often waxy to the touch, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like philodendrons and peace lilies. Aglaonema nitidum thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
