It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.
