    "intro": "Azorella trifuscata, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Azorella trifuscata is well adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique growth form helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions."
