    "intro": "Aspalthium herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Aspalthium herbaceum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
