    "intro": "Alchemilla hirsuta, commonly known as hairy ladies' mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Alchemilla hirsuta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
