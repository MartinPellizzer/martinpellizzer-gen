    "intro": "Adiantum littorale, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky shores and in sandy soils. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize coastal soils. Adiantum littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in coastal ecosystems.",
