    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata subsp. attenuata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland ecosystems and genetic diversity in wild wheat relatives."
