    "intro": "Aristolochia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and serrated edges. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions despite its potential hazards."
