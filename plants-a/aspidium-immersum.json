    "intro": "Aspidium immersum, commonly known as the submerged water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged in water, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium immersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
