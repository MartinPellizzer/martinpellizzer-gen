    "intro": "Anchusa calcarea subsp. losadae, commonly known as the Losada's common bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, compact stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
