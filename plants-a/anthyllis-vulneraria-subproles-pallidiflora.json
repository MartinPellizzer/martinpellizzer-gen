It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in its native range."
