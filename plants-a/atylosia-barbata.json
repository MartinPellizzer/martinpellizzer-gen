    "intro": "Atylosia barbata, commonly known as the hairy leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color, and its yellow-orange flower heads bloom in late summer. Atylosia barbata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
