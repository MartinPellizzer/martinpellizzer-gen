    "intro": "Astragalus sympileicarpus, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces unique fruit structures called syngenesious follicles, which are tightly fused and release seeds through a specialized mechanism. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Astragalus sympileicarpus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife in its native range."
