    "intro": "Avena elatior f. ramifera, commonly known as the ramifera form of the tall oat, is a variant of the tall oat species characterized by its branched inflorescence. This form exhibits a more complex floral structure compared to the typical straight spike of the species. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance. Botanically, it retains the genetic traits of Avena elatior but displays morphological variations in its flowering pattern."
