    "intro": "Atriplex cristata var. arenaria, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in deserts and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are usually succulent and adapted to reduce water loss, with a waxy coating to reflect sunlight. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
