    "intro": "Astragalus dendridium, commonly known as the tree milkvetch, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Astragalus dendridium has deep root systems that enable it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
