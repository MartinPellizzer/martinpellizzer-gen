    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the red maple with small leaves, is a rare and distinctive variant of the red maple. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact leaves compared to the typical red maple, which gives it a unique appearance. This form is often found in specific ecological niches, such as moist, acidic soils in forested areas. The leaves are usually bright red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown.",
