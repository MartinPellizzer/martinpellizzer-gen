    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum subsp. pruinosum, commonly known as the purple garlic or grape leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features elongated, cylindrical bulbs covered in a purple or reddish skin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels. Its bulbs are often used in cooking, similar to leeks or garlic, and are valued for their mild, sweet flavor. Botanically, it is closely related to other Allium species and is characterized by its distinctive coloration and growth habit."
