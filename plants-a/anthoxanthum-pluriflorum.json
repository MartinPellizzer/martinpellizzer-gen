    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pluriflorum, commonly known as the common oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Anthoxanthum pluriflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
