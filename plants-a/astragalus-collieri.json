    "intro": "Astragalus collieri, commonly known as the Collier's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Astragalus collieri is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
