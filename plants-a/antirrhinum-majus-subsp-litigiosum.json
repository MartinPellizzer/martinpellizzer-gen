    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus subsp. litigiosum, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling tiny bells. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, which is a unique adaptation to attract pollinators."
