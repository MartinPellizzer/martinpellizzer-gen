    "intro": "Agelanthus schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
