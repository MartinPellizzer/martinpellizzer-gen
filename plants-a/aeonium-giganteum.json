    "intro": "Aeonium giganteum, commonly known as the tree aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant in arid climates."
