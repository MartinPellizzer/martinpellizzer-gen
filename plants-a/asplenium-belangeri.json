    "intro": "Asplenium belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium belangeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
