    "intro": "Adelobotrys multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Adelobotrys multiflorus is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.",
