    "intro": "Astragalus subcompressus, commonly known as the compressed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions. Astragalus subcompressus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
