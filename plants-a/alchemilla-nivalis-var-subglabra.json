    "intro": "Alchemilla nivalis var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are typically smooth and have a distinctive shield-like shape, contributing to its common name. This variety is well adapted to rocky and moist environments, making it a hardy plant in high-altitude ecosystems."
