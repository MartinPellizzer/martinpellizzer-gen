    "intro": "Acyntha ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Acyntha ehrenbergii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.",
