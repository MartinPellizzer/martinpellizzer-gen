    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa subsp. truncata, commonly known as the truncated spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rounded spikelets and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to its role in local ecosystems. The subspecies is noted for its resilience to drought and its potential use in forage and soil stabilization."
