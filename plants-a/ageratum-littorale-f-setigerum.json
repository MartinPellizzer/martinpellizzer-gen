    "intro": "Ageratum littorale f. setigerum, commonly known as the coastal ageratum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens where it can tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This ornamental plant is often used in landscaping for its ability to attract pollinators and its drought-resistant nature."
