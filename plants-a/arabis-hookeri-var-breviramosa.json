    "intro": "Arabis hookeri var. breviramosa, commonly known as the short-stemmed rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
