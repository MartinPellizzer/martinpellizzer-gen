    "intro": "Astragalus ochranthus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus ochranthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
