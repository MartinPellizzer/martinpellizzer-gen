    "intro": "Acrotriche prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate acrotriche, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes reduced to scales, adapting to minimize water evaporation. Acrotriche prostrata is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water once established.",
