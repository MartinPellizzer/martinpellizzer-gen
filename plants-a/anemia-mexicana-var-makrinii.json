It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, petal-like bracts that resemble true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a short growing season. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, green berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
