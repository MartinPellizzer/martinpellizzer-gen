It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
