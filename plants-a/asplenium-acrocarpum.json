    "intro": "Asplenium acrocarpum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium acrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
