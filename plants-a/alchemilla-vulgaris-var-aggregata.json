    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. aggregata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for erosion control and as a ornamental in gardens."
