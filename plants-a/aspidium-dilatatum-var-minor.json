    "intro": "Aspidium dilatatum var. minor, commonly known as the small feather fern, is a variant of the broad fern, characterized by its smaller fronds compared to the typical species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features dimorphic fronds, with sterile fronds being more elongated and fertile fronds shorter and more compact. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
