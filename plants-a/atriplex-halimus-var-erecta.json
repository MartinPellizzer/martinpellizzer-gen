    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. erecta, commonly known as the upright saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often followed by small, triangular bracts. This plant is well adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a valuable species for rehabilitation of degraded soils."
