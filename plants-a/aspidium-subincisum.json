    "intro": "Aspidium subincisum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a member of the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often narrowly lanceolate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and wet forests. Its spores are released in spring, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid climates."
