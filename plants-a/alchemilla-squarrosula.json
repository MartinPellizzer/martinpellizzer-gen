It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla squarrosula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
