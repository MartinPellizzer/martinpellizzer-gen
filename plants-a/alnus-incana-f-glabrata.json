    "intro": "Alnus incana f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and alternate along the stems. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants."
