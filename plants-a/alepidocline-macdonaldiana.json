It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
