It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
