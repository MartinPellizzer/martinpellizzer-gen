It features large, showy blue or white flower clusters that bloom in summer, rising on tall, sturdy stems. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
