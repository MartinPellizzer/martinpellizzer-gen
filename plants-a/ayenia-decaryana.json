    "intro": "Ayenia decaryana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and distinctive, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Ayenia decaryana is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
