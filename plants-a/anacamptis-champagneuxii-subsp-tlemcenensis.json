    "intro": "Anacamptis champagneuxii subsp. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Algeria. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
