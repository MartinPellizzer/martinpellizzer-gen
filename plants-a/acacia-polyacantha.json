    "intro": "Acacia polyacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and compound leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid and semi-arid regions. Acacia polyacantha is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polyacantha is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Karoo and Kalahari areas. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polyacantha was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought in for its ornamental value and for soil stabilization purposes. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to significant ecological concerns, including the displacement of indigenous plant species. Efforts are now underway to control its spread and mitigate its impact on the environment."
