    "intro": "Andrachne reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in dry environments. Andrachne reflexa is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive with minimal water."
