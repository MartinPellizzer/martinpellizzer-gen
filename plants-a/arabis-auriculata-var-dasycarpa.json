    "intro": "Arabis auriculata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-capsule rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, hairy, spherical seed capsules. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
