    "intro": "Aristolochia cornuta, commonly known as the purple swallowwort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that range from green to purple in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
