    "intro": "Artemisia lobulifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, and its aromatic, minty scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Artemisia lobulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
