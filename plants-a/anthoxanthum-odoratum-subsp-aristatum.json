    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subsp. aristatum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which are composed of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. The subspecies aristatum differs from the main species by its more upright growth habit and the presence of a terminal spikelet."
