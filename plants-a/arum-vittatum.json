It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf with a prominent, waxy purple spathe that encloses a spadix of small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its foliage is often marked with contrasting white or yellow veins, adding to its ornamental appeal. Arum vittatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
