    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or damp meadows. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
