    "intro": "Acantholimon sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Acantholimon sintenisii is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon sintenisii is primarily native to the island of Sint Eustatius, part of the Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean. It is found in the dry, rocky coastal areas and limestone formations of the island. This plant is adapted to the arid and saline conditions typical of its coastal habitat. It is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon sintenisii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly found in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in warm, dry conditions with minimal rainfall. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It requires low maintenance and is resistant to pests and diseases. Its distribution is limited to regions with specific environmental conditions that mimic its native habitat."
