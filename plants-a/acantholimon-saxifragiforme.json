    "intro": "Acantholimon saxifragiforme, commonly known as the saxifrage-like thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features dense, grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Acantholimon saxifragiforme is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon saxifragiforme is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in the rocky and arid regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas. This plant thrives in dry, limestone-rich soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate and limited water availability of its native range. Its distribution is relatively restricted, making it a characteristic species of Turkey's unique flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon saxifragiforme was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained conditions and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. Its introduction may have ecological implications due to its adaptability and potential for rapid colonization."
