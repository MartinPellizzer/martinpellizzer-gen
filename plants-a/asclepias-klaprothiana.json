    "intro": "Asclepias klaprothiana, commonly known as the Klaproth's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called corollas. Its milky sap contains latex, which is typical of the genus Asclepias. This species plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
