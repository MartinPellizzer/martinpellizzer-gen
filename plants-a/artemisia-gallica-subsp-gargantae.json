    "intro": "Artemisia gallica subsp. gargantae, commonly known as giant wormwood, is a robust perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and sturdy, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its strong scent and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
