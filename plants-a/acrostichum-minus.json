    "intro": "Acrostichum minus, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to form dense clumps. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in humid, tropical habitats.",
