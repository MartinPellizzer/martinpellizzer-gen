    "intro": "Acrostichum listeri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various species.",
