    "intro": "Ardisia nervosa, commonly known as the veined evergreen, is a tropical shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent veins. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Following flowering, it develops red or orange berries that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Ardisia nervosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens due to its compact growth habit and year-round foliage."
