    "intro": "Alopecurus altaicus, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and tundra. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Alopecurus altaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
