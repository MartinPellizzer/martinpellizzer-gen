    "intro": "Alyssum repens f. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
