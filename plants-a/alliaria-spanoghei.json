    "intro": "Alliaria spanoghei, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers and has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. Alliaria spanoghei is also known for its pungent, garlic-like odor when the leaves are crushed."
