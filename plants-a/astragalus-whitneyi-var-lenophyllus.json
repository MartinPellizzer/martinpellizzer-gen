    "intro": "Astragalus whitneyi var. lenophyllus, commonly known as Whitney's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has small, inflated pods that contain seeds, and its root system is often extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in its native range."
