It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda pulchella var. longifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern United States. This plant has been introduced to gardens and naturalized areas due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It thrives in environments where there is adequate water availability throughout the growing season. However, its spread has raised concerns in some regions due to potential ecological impacts."
