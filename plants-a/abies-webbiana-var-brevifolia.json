    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies webbiana var. brevifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This variety is commonly found in high-altitude forests within the Hengduan Mountains and the eastern Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and diverse microclimates of these areas. It plays an important ecological role in these forest ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies webbiana var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in mountainous or forested areas. It is commonly found in areas with high elevation and moderate precipitation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
