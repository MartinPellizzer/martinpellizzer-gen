    "intro": "Amphidoxa villosa, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Amphidoxa villosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
