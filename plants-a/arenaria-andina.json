    "intro": "Arenaria andina, commonly known as Andean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from the harsh, cold environment. Arenaria andina is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, making it a hardy species found in mountainous regions."
