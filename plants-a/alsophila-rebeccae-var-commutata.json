    "intro": "Alsophila rebeccae var. commutata, commonly known as the Commutate Tree Fern, is a variant of the rebeccae tree fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive dimorphism, with the upper fronds being more slender and the lower ones broader. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
