    "intro": "Astragalus listoniae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus listoniae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
