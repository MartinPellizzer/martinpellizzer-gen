    "intro": "Arenaria gypsophiloides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, glabrous leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other variants of the species."
