It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.
