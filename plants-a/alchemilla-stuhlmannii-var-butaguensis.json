    "intro": "Alchemilla stuhlmannii var. butaguensis, commonly known as the Butaguan lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that resembles a shield, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in open, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens. Its medicinal properties have been explored in traditional herbal practices, though scientific validation remains limited."
