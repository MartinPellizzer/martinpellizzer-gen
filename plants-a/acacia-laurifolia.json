    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia laurifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This species is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa. It is commonly found in dry, open environments where it forms part of the local vegetation. Acacia laurifolia is well adapted to seasonal droughts and can tolerate a range of soil types.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia laurifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate drought conditions. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to both horticultural use and natural spread in suitable environments."
