    "intro": "Antidesma crenatum, commonly known as the African starfruit or wild starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Antidesma crenatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and fruit."
