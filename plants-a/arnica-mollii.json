    "intro": "Arnica mollii, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Arnica mollii is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies for inflammation and pain relief."
