    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its compact form and seasonal color changes. This variety is well-suited for smaller gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings.",
