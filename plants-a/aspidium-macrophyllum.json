    "intro": "Aspidium macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds developing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
