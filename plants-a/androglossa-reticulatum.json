    "intro": "Androglossa reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulated androglossa, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Androglossa reticulatum is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some traditional practices for its fibrous material."
