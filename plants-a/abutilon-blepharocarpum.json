    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon blepharocarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing along the edges of forests or in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends across several regions where it adapts well to moist, well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon blepharocarpum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped fruits. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists or through accidental introduction via shipping. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in disturbed soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in urban and agricultural settings, often growing along roadsides and in vacant lots. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread readily."
