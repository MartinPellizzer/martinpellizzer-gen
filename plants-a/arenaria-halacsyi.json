    "intro": "Arenaria halacsyi, commonly known as the Armenian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Arenaria halacsyi is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
