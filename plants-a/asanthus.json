    "intro": "Asanthus, commonly known as the yellow wood or African yellowwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and the presence of compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in racemes, and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Asanthus species are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are valued for their hard, durable wood and are often used in traditional construction and crafts."
