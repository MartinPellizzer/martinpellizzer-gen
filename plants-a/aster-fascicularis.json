    "intro": "Aster fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Aster fascicularis plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a valued plant in wetland restoration projects."
