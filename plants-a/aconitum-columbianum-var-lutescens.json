    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellowish monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features striking, hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple, though this variety has a distinctive yellowish hue. The plant grows up to 2 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
