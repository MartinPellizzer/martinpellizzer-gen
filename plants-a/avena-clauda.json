    "intro": "Avena clauda, commonly known as the slender oat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Avena clauda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
