    "intro": "Annesorhiza interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted annesorhiza, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
