    "intro": "Arenaria isaurica, commonly known as Isaurian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in its dry habitat. Arenaria isaurica is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
