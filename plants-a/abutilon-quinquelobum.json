    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon quinquelobum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is also found in parts of northern South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Venezuela. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in disturbed habitats like roadsides, fields, and forest edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland areas. Its natural range extends into the Caribbean islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon quinquelobum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its fuzzy leaves and showy flowers making it a popular choice for landscaping. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
