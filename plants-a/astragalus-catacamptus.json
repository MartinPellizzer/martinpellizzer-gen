    "intro": "Astragalus catacamptus, commonly known as the bentstem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus catacamptus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
