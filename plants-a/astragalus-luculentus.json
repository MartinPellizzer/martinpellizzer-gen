    "intro": "Astragalus luculentus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus luculentus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
