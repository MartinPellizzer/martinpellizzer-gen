    "intro": "Amsinckia nesophila, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia nesophila is often found in rocky soils and is considered an important species for stabilizing desert ecosystems."
