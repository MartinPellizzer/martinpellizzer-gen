    "intro": "Aristolochia obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish or purple hue. The plant is a deciduous vine that climbs using tendrils and produces showy, fragrant blooms in the spring. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
