    "intro": "Amorpha nana, commonly known as dwarf false indigo, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval, toothed leaflets that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Amorpha nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
