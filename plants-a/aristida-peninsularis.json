    "intro": "Aristida peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular three-awn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bristly awns. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Aristida peninsularis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and provides forage for wildlife."
