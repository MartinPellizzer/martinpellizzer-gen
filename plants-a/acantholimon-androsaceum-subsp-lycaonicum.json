    "intro": "Acantholimon androsaceum subsp. lycaonicum, commonly known as the Lycaonicum spurgeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon androsaceum subsp. lycaonicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the countries of Greece, Albania, and parts of southern Italy. This subspecies is commonly found in rocky and limestone habitats at high altitudes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with alpine and subalpine vegetation. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of these environments. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, reflecting its specialized habitat requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon androsaceum subsp. lycaonicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils along coastal areas and in dry, sunny habitats. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, waste areas, and cultivated fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including accidental transport through trade or landscaping. It has since become naturalized in several regions, showing adaptability to diverse environmental conditions."
