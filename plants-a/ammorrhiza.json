    "intro": "Ammorrhiza, commonly known as sea blush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, sandy soils. They are characterized by their showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ammorrhiza species are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
