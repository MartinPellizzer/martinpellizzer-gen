    "intro": "Aptandra caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Aptandra caudata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
