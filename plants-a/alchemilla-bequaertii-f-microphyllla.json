    "intro": "Alchemilla bequaertii f. microphyllla, commonly known as the miniature leaf alchemilla, is a unique variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features dense, rosette-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, mat-like appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow, appearing in early summer, and are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded garden environments."
