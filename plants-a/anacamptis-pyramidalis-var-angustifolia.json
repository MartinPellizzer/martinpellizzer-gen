    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms from May to July, and its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
