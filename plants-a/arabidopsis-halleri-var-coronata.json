    "intro": "Arabidopsis halleri var. coronata, commonly known as the silverleaf sorrel, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Central and Southern Europe, this species thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a useful model organism in ecological and genetic studies."
