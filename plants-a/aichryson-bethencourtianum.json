    "intro": "Aichryson bethencourtianum, commonly known as the Bethencourt's aichryson, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring and summer months. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
