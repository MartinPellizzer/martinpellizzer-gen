    "intro": "Abies ernestii var. salouenensis, commonly known as the Salouenensis fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain aromatic seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies ernestii var. salouenensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains. This variant of the silver fir is found in high-altitude areas where the climate is cool and moist. It typically grows in mixed forests alongside other coniferous and broadleaf species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with significant precipitation. Its native range is limited, making it a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies ernestii var. salouenensis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its ornamental value and unique foliage. The plant prefers partial to full shade and is relatively slow-growing, making it suitable for smaller landscapes. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its resistance to certain pests and diseases. However, it is not commonly found in the wild and remains a rare ornamental species in many regions."
