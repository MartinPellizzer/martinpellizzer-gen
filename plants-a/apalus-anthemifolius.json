    "intro": "Apalus anthemifolius, commonly known as the yellow-flowered apalus, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and its clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
