    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's maple, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common maple. It is characterized by its uniquely shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and often resemble the shape of a maple leaf with a more pronounced central vein. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and parks where its striking foliage adds visual interest. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn, making it a popular choice for landscape design. Due to its rarity and specific cultivation requirements, it is often found in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
