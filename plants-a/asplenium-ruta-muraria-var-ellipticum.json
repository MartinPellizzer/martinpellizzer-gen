    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its elliptical-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
