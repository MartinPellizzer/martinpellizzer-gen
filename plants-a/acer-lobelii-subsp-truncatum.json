It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often reddish in color and turn vibrant orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",
