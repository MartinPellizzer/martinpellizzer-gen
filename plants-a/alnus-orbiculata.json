    "intro": "Alnus orbiculata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in coniferous forests. Alnus orbiculata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
