    "intro": "Acacia colubrina, commonly known as the Florida acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia colubrina thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia colubrina is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in dry to semi-arid environments. It is also known to occur in parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Acacia colubrina is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia colubrina was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in coastal environments. It has been widely planted along highways, dunes, and in residential areas for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. However, its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions. Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits in certain habitats. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising questions about its long-term environmental effects."
