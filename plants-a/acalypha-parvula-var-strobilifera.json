    "intro": "Acalypha parvula var. strobilifera, commonly known as the coral bells, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, colorful bracts that resemble small coral-like structures, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, red, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.",

This variant of Acalypha parvula is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal habitats of the archipelago. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and environmental conditions of the region. Its distribution is limited to the Gal\u00e1pagos, making it a distinctive component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula var. strobilifera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural landscapes. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
