    "intro": "Acmella, commonly known as the \"Cape rose\" or \"pink weed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Acmella species are often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. They produce small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. The genus includes several species, such as Acmella oleracea, which is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
