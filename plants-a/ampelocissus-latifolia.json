    "intro": "Ampelocissus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fig-leaf plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits resembling figs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
