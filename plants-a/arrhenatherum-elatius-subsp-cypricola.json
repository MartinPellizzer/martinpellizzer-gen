It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This subspecies typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along the edges of bogs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
