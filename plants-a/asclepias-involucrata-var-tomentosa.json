    "intro": "Asclepias involucrata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. As a member of the milkweed family, it plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
