    "intro": "Abrotanella caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically in arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Abrotanella caespitosa is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella caespitosa is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. This species is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of both the North and South Islands. It thrives in rocky and open habitats, often growing in grasslands and on slopes. The plant is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of New Zealand. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella caespitosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in disturbed soils. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become invasive in some regions. However, it is also valued for its small, showy flowers and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
