    "intro": "Achilleopsis, commonly known as false yarrow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Achilleopsis clypeolata, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. These plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters. They are often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Achilleopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
