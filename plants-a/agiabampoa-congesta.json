    "intro": "Agiabampoa congesta, commonly known as the dense-flowered agiabampoa, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention. Agiabampoa congesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
