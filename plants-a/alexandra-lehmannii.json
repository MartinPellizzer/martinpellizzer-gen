    "intro": "Alexandra lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of southern South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers feature six petals and a prominent, spurred structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alexandra lehmannii is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its population."
