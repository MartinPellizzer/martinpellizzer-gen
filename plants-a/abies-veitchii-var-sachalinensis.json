    "intro": "Abies veitchii var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Sakhalin in the Russian Far East. It is a variant of the Veitch fir, characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically pendulous, with elongated scales and a distinctive, sweet scent. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. sachalinensis is primarily native to the northern regions of Japan, specifically the island of Hokkaido. This variant of the Engelmann spruce is found in high-altitude areas with cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic locations within Japan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. sachalinensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental horticulture efforts. This variety is prized for its unique foliage and compact growth habit. It has since become a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and temperate climates. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
