    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its compact stature and ability to form dense turf make it suitable for ornamental use in landscaping. Agrostis tenuis var. pumila is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
