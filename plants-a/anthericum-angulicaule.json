It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Anthericum angulicaule is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
