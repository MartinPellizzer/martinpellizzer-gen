    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes and ecological restoration projects."
