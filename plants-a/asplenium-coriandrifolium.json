    "intro": "Asplenium coriandrifolium, commonly known as the coriander-leaved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The fronds are typically dark green and have a finely serrated margin, giving them a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
