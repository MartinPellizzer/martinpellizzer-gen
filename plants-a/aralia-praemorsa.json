It features compound leaves that are typically palmately lobed, with a distinctive, somewhat coarse texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in native plant gardens."
