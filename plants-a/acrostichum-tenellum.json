    "intro": "Acrostichum tenellum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Acrostichum tenellum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.",
