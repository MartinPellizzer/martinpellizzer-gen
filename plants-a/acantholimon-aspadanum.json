    "intro": "Acantholimon aspadanum, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous and semi-desert areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and southwestern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon aspadanum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in coastal areas. This plant is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in well-drained soils. It is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue or purple flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
