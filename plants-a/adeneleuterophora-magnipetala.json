    "intro": "Adeneleuterophora magnipetala, commonly known as the large-petaled adeneleuterophora, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy petals that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, displaying a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
