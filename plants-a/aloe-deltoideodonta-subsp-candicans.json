It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their soothing gel. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
