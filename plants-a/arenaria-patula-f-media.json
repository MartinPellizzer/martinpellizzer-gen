    "intro": "Arenaria patula f. media, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant's leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
