    "intro": "Angraecum stella-africae, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded forest environments. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its inflorescence is a raceme, with each flower having a unique, elongated lip that is characteristic of the Angraecum genus. This orchid is also notable for its ability to produce a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators like moths."
