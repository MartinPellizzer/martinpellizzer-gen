    "intro": "Arachniodes multifida, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive forked shape that contributes to its ornamental value."
