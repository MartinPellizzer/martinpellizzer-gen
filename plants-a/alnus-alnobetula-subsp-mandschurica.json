    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subsp. mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
