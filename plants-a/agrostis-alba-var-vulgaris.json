    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. vulgaris, commonly known as white oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-gray hue due to the fine hairs covering its foliage. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white to pale green flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
