It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
