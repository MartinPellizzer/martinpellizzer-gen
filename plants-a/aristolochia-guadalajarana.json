    "intro": "Aristolochia guadalajarana, commonly known as the Guadalajara Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its flowers are typically greenish-brown with a prominent, showy lip. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
