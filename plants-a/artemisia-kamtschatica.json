    "intro": "Artemisia kamtschatica, commonly known as Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the branches. Artemisia kamtschatica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
