    "intro": "Astragalus nivelleanus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus nivelleanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
