    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula var. filifolia, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, soft, and often silvery-gray blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in gardens."
