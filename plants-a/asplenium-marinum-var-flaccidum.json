    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. flaccidum, commonly known as the sea spleenwort, is a variant of the coastal spleenwort found in maritime environments. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky substrates near the coast. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. It thrives in humid, saline conditions and is often found in tidal zones or on cliff faces. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of coastal ecosystems."
