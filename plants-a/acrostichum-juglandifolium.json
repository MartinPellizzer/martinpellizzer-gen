    "intro": "Acrostichum juglandifolium, commonly known as the nutleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are often divided into segments resembling the leaves of walnut trees, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The nutleaf fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
