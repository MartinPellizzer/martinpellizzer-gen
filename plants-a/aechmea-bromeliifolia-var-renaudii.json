    "intro": "Aechmea bromeliifolia var. renaudii, commonly known as the Red-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its flower spikes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
