It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
