    "intro": "Androsace tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Androsace tibetica is adapted to cold, arid conditions and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of high-altitude flora."
