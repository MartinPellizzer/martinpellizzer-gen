It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
