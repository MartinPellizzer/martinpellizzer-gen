    "intro": "Acalypha repanda, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display a vibrant mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Acalypha repanda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha repanda is primarily native to Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. It is commonly found in tropical regions within these island nations. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. It is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha repanda was mainly introduced to Society Is. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environment of Society Is. It has become a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species and ecosystem balance."
