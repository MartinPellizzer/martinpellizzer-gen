    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha somalensis is primarily native to Somalia and parts of eastern Ethiopia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southern and central parts of Somalia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing in shrublands and along coastal areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha somalensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements."
