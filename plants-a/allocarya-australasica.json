    "intro": "Allocarya australasica, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for making clothing and other crafts. Allocarya australasica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for native birds and its contribution to the biodiversity of New Zealand's ecosystems."
