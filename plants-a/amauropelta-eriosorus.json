    "intro": "Amauropelta eriosorus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a shield-like structure, providing protection to the fertile structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Amauropelta eriosorus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
