    "intro": "Austrochloris, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and is typically found in sandy or coastal environments. The plants have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Austrochloris species are adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making them resilient in coastal ecosystems. Their ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
