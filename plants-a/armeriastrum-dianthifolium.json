    "intro": "Armeriastrum dianthifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf armeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
