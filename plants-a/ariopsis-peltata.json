It belongs to the family Pelagieae and is characterized by its distinctive peltate (plate-like) bell structure. The organism has a translucent, umbrella-shaped body with long, trailing tentacles that are used for capturing prey. It thrives in warm, shallow coastal waters and is often seen during the summer months. The peltate sea nettle plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey."
