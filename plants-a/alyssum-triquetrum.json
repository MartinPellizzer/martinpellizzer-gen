    "intro": "Alyssum triquetrum, commonly known as three-angled alyssum, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often three-angled in cross-section. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Alyssum triquetrum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments."
