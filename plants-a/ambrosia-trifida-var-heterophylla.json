    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida var. heterophylla, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a significant weed in many regions."
