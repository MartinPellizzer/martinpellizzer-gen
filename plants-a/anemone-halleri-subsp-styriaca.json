    "intro": "Anemone halleri subsp. styriaca, commonly known as the Styrian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and a cluster of showy, white to pale pink flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Anemone genus."
