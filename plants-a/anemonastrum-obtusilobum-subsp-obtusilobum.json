    "intro": "Anemonastrum obtusilobum subsp. obtusilobum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
