    "intro": "Alisma virgata, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along pond edges. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Alisma virgata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
