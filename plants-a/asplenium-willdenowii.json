    "intro": "Asplenium willdenowii, commonly known as the Willdenow's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium willdenowii is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in humid, forested areas."
