It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is of interest for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture."
