    "intro": "Andropogon racemosus, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture. Wiregrass plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
