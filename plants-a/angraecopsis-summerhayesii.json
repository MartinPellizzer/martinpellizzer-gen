    "intro": "Angraecopsis summerhayesii, commonly known as the summerhayes ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in rocky outcrops and has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a rare and sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered."
