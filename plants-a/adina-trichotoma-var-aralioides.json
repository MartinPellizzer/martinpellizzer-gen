    "intro": "Adina trichotoma var. aralioides, commonly known as the African snowball or white ant plant, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets that give it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in warm climates due to its preference for bright, indirect light and well-drained soil.",
