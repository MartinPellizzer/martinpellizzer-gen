    "intro": "Arisaema ternatum, commonly known as the Indian turnip, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that resembles a crown, which is composed of a spadix enclosed by a leaf-like bract. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
