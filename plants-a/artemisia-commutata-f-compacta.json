    "intro": "Artemisia commutata f. compacta, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinct scent and medicinal properties."
