    "intro": "Aciotis paludosa, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Aciotis paludosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.",
