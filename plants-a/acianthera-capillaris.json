    "intro": "Acianthera capillaris, commonly known as the slender acianthera, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
