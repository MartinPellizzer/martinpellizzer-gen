    "intro": "Alnus incana var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval silky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are softly hairy on both sides, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
