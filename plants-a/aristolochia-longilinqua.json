    "intro": "Aristolochia longilinqua, commonly known as the long-stemmed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant has a complex, winding structure with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a long, slender capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in moist, shaded environments within forests."
