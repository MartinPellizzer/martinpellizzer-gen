    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis belladonna and Amaryllis textilis. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching heights of only 10 to 15 centimeters, making it a popular choice for container gardening. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are broad and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Amaryllis \u00d7 brevifolia thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
