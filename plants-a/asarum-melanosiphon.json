    "intro": "Asarum melanosiphon, commonly known as black-tongued asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, dark purple to black flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic, often spicy scent, which is attributed to its complex chemical composition. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. However, due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially hazardous plant for human and animal consumption."
