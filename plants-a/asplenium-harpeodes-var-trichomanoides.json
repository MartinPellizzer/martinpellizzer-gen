    "intro": "Asplenium harpeodes var. trichomanoides, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
