    "intro": "Antennaria rosea subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rose-like pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
