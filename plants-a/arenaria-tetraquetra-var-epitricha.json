    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. epitricha, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
