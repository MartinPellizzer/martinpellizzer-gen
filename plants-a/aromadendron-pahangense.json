    "intro": "Aromadendron pahangense, commonly known as the Pahang sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Malaysia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are lance-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and emit a subtle scent when crushed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
