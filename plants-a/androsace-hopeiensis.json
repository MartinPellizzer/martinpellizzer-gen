It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, often hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
