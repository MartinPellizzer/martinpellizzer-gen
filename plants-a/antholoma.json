    "intro": "Antholoma, commonly known as the \"false button mushroom,\" is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, often colorful caps and gilled structures, which can resemble those of edible mushrooms. The spore-bearing surface, or gills, are typically attached to the stem and can vary in color from white to brown. Antholoma species are often found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or leaf litter. These fungi are generally considered non-toxic but are not typically consumed due to their mild flavor and less robust structure."
