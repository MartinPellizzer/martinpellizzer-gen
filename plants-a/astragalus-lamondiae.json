    "intro": "Astragalus lamondiae, commonly known as Lamond's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
