    "intro": "Asperula boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's wood rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Asperula boissieri is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
