    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer auritum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. This species is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. It is known for its distinctive ear-shaped leaves and is often associated with cloud forests and montane ecosystems. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer auritum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and riparian zones. This species is valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique ear-shaped leaves. It has been cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in certain environments if not managed properly."
