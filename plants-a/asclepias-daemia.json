    "intro": "Asclepias daemia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright stems that can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers with prominent, horn-like buds, which are characteristic of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Asclepias daemia is a valuable host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators."
