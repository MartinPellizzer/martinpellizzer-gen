It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, adapted to drought conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
