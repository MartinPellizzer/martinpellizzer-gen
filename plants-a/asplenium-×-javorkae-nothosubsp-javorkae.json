    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 javorkae nothosubsp. javorkae, commonly known as the Java spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
