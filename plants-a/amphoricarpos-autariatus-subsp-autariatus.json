    "intro": "Amphoricarpos autariatus subsp. autariatus, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
