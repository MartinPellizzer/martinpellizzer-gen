    "intro": "Astragalus brachytrichus, commonly known as the short-hairy milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus brachytrichus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
