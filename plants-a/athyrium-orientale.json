    "intro": "Athyrium orientale, commonly known as the oriental lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of ferns."
