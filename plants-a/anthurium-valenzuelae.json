    "intro": "Anthurium valenzuelae, commonly known as the velvet heart anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and exhibit a deep green to dark red coloration. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to red. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium valenzuelae is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
