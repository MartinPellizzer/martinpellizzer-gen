    "intro": "Astronidium muscosum, commonly known as the sticky wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a distinctive sticky, waxy coating on its leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. The leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
