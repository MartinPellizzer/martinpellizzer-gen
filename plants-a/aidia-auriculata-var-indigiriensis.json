    "intro": "Aidia auriculata var. indigiriensis, commonly known as the Indigiriensis Aidia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
