    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. savignonei, commonly known as the Savignone wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
