    "intro": "Aulomyrcia jequitinhonhensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved aulomyrcia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are usually smaller than those of the typical variety, hence its name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a white or pale yellow color. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
