    "intro": "Acroceras calcicola, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, with five petals and numerous stamens. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.",
