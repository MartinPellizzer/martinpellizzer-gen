    "intro": "Androcymbium hantamense, commonly known as the Hantam bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It produces small, oval berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
