    "intro": "Annona stenophylla subsp. longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces a fruit that is similar to the common soursop but is typically smaller and has a more pronounced spiny exterior. The fruit contains a white, fleshy pulp with a mildly acidic taste, and it is often used in local cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Annonaceae family and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
