    "intro": "Allium madidum, commonly known as the wetland garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshes in North America. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and develops bulbous structures similar to onions, though they are not typically edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Allium madidum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
