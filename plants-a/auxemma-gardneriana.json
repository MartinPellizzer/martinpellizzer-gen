    "intro": "Auxemma gardneriana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It thrives in brackish or saline water, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has smooth, dark bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. Auxemma gardneriana is well adapted to tidal zones and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
