    "intro": "Alopecurus trivialis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in fields. Alopecurus trivialis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
