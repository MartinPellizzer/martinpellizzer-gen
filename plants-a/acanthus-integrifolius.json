    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus integrifolius is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky coastal areas and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This plant is commonly found in countries such as Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Morocco. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus integrifolius was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and floral displays. It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and the Middle East, where it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along rocky coastlines, where it adapts well to coastal environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth in natural habitats."
