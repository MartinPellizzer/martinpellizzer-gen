    "intro": "Allium ulleungense, commonly known as the Ulleung Island garlic, is a rare species native to the Korean island of Ulleungdo. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the humid, coastal climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
