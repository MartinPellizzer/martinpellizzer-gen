    "intro": "Arenaria rotundifolia subsp. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
