    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. denticulata, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a variant of the European alder native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
