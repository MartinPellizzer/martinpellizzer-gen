It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in dune environments. Austrobassia costata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
