    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. obovatus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the warm regions of the Americas. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with robust roots that help stabilize soil. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, pale green or purple flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and adaptability to various soil types."
