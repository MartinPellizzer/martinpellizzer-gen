    "intro": "Asplenium nidus var. curtisorum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a variant of the common bird's nest fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant features a thick, creeping rhizome that produces multiple fiddleheads, which unfurl into broad, leathery leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, often with a slight curl at the tips. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
