    "intro": "Andinia cordilabia, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
