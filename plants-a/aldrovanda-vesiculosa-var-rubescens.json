    "intro": "Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. rubescens, commonly known as the red waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, floating, water-filled traps that snap shut to capture prey. The plant's leaves are typically red or pink in color, which distinguishes it from the more common green variety. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
