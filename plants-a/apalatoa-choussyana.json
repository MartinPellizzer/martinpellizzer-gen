    "intro": "Apalatoa choussyana, commonly known as the Choussy's apalatoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
