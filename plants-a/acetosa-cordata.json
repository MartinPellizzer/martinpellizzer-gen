    "intro": "Acetosa cordata, commonly known as heartleaf sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often sour due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Acetosa cordata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in culinary and medicinal applications.",
