    "intro": "Antrophyum giganteum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones growing at the base of the trunk and the female cones at the top. It is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a valuable component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered."
