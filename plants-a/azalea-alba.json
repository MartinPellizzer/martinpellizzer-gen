It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and are arranged in whorls around the stems. Azalea alba thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and ability to form dense, compact growth."
