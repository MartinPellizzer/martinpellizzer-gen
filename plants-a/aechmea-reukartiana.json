    "intro": "Aechmea reukartiana, commonly known as the Reukart's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aechmea reukartiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
