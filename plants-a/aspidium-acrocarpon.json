    "intro": "Aspidium acrocarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium acrocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
