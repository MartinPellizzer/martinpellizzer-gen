    "intro": "Ainsliaea reflexa var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine Ainsliaea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, dry climates with limited growing seasons."
