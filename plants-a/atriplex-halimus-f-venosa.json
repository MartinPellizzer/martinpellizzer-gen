    "intro": "Atriplex halimus f. venosa, commonly known as the smooth saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, glabrous leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
