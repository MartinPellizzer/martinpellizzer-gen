This species is found in the tropical regions of Micronesia, specifically on the island of Truk. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha trukensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Pacific Islands. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability. It has been introduced as an ornamental plant in some regions. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
