    "intro": "Allium talassicum, commonly known as sea garlic, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in maritime environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful plant in coastal agriculture. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
