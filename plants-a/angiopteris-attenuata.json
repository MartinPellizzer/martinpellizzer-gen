    "intro": "Angiopteris attenuata, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Angiopteris attenuata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and adaptability to a variety of growing conditions."
