    "intro": "Androcymbium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and pink, with a distinctive lip that is longer than the rest of the petals. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
