    "intro": "Aspidium aristatum var. davalliiforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to wet soil or submerged substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
