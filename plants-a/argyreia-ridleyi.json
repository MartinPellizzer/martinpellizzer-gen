    "intro": "Argyreia ridleyi, commonly known as the red veined morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its rapid growth habit makes it popular in ornamental horticulture, though it can be invasive in some regions. The seeds are enclosed in a thick, woody capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
