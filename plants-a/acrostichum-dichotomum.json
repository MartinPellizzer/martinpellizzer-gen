    "intro": "Acrostichum dichotomum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each frond splits into two equal parts, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy, with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The split fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
