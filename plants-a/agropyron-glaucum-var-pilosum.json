    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky-haired leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities."
