    "intro": "Agrostis virletii, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often loosely arranged. Agrostis virletii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
