    "intro": "Asyneuma amanum, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, rounded fruits known as cypsela. Asyneuma amanum is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
