    "intro": "Abarema multifoliolata, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or the giant fern, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and it has a unique ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets arranged in a delicate, lace-like pattern. Abarema multifoliolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema multifoliolata is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil's biodiversity-rich regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema multifoliolata was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth rate. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with warm climates and adequate rainfall."
