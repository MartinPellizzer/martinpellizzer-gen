    "intro": "Angiopteris oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris oblanceolata plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
