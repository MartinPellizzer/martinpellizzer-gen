    "intro": "Azalea lepidota, commonly known as the silverleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Azalea lepidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide seasonal color in gardens."
