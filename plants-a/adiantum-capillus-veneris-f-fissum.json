    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris f. fissum, commonly known as the \"Maiden's Tears\" or \"Veil Tarn,\" is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant features a basal rosette of fertile fronds that are shorter and more robust than the sterile ones, which are longer and more slender. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a smooth, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The fronds are arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving the plant a graceful and elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.",
