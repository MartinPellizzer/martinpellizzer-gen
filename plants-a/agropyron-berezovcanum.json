It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and arid conditions, making it a hardy species. Agropyron berezovcanum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and degraded areas."
