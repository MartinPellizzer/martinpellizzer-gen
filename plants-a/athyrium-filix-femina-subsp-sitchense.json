    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. sitchense, commonly known as the Sichuan lady fern, is a rare and ornamental fern species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that display a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often slightly curled and lighter in color. This subspecies is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
