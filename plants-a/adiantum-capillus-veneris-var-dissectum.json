    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris var. dissectum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to temperate regions. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with each frond typically reaching lengths of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded indoor environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nocturnal pollination by attracting insects. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and therapeutic use.",
