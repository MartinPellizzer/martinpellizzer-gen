    "intro": "Agrostis reinwardtii var. borneensis, commonly known as Bornean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to humid tropical climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
