    "intro": "Ariadne shaferi var. rivularis, commonly known as the river iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in rugged terrain, while its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
