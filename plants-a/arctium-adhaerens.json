    "intro": "Arctium adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of spiny, bur-like fruits that adhere to animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
