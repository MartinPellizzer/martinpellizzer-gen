    "intro": "Amauropelta frigida, commonly known as the cold rock fern, is a rare and resilient fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes and in shaded forest understories. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Amauropelta frigida is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and climate change."
