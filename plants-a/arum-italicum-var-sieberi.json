It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are spadix-like flowers surrounded by a spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage structure."
