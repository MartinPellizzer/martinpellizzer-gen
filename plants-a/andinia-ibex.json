    "intro": "Andinia ibex, commonly known as the Ibex lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal partner. This lichen is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that is often pale yellow or orange in color. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for environmental stability."
