    "intro": "Amorphophallus kaessneri, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence that can reach heights of over 3 meters, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its roots form a dense network beneath the water, anchoring the plant and contributing to water filtration. This species plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
