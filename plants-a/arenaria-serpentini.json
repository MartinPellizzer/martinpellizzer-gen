    "intro": "Arenaria serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cold climates."
