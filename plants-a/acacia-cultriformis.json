    "intro": "Acacia cultriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leaf-like phyllodes that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and have a narrow, blade-like shape. The plant produces small, yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia cultriformis is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its growth habit and appearance make it a distinctive component of coastal and inland vegetation in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cultriformis is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This species is commonly found in dry, sandy soils within these regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cultriformis was mainly introduced to Argentina Northeast, Assam, Brazil Northeast, California, Cape Provinces, Ethiopia, India, Jawa, and Zimbabwe. It has been established in these regions, often as an ornamental or for soil stabilization purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for the diverse environments listed. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species. Despite its spread, it remains a significant species in certain parts of the world due to its hardiness and adaptability."
