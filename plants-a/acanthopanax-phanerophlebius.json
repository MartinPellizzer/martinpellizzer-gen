    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax phanerophlebius is primarily native to the temperate regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. This plant thrives in forested environments, often growing on rocky or forested slopes. It is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of northeastern China. Its natural range extends into the highlands of southeastern Siberia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax phanerophlebius was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in eastern Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and Korea. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land development and the movement of plant material. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
