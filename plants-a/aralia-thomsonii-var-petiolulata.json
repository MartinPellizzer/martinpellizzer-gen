    "intro": "Aralia thomsonii var. petiolulata, commonly known as the Thomson's aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like foliage that gives it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spherical, spiny berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
