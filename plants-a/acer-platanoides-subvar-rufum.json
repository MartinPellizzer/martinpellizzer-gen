    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. rufum, commonly known as the red maple or red-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange foliage in autumn, which sets it apart from other maple species. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with coarsely toothed margins and a deep green color during the growing season. It produces small, pendulous clusters of yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
