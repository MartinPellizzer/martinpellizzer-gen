    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly garlic or the curly-leaved garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often curled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense umbel. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings. The bulbs are edible but less commonly used in cooking compared to other allium species."
