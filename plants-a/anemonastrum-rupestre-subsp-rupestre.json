    "intro": "Anemonastrum rupestre subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found growing on slopes and in crevices. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
