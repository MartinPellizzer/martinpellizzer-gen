    "intro": "Adonis aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian glory of the snow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces striking, showy yellow flowers with a red-tipped center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
