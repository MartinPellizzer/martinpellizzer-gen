    "intro": "Aspidium transitorium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to substrates like rocks or soil. Aspidium transitorium plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
