    "intro": "Astragalus recognitus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across arid regions. Astragalus recognitus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
