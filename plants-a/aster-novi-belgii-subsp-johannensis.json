The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable candidate for gardens and naturalized areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
