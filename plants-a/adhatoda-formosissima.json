    "intro": "Adhatoda formosissima, commonly known as the Chinese skullcap, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of alkaloids, particularly berberine and tetrahydroprotoberberine. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and traditional medicinal purposes.",
