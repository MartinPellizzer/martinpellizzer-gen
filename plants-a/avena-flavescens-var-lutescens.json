    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a light green to yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are often yellow or golden in hue. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
