    "intro": "Anthemis kotschyana var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum anthemis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich substrates. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
