    "intro": "Andropogon africanus, commonly known as African bluestem, is a perennial grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Andropogon africanus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
