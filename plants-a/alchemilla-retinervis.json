    "intro": "Alchemilla retinervis, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, silver-green leaves that have a distinctive veined pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla retinervis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
