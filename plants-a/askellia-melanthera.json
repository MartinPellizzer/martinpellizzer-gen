    "intro": "Askellia melanthera, commonly known as the black-throated morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black corolla with a contrasting white throat. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Its vine-like growth habit allows it to climb and spread across various substrates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Askellia melanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
