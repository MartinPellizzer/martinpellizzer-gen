    "intro": "Ardisia pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia pluriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
