    "intro": "Arethusa gentianoides, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in dense clusters, often forming a low-growing mat. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Arethusa gentianoides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
