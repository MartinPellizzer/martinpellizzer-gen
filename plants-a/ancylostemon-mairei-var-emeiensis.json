    "intro": "Ancylostemon mairei var. emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to southern China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
