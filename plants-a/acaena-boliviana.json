    "intro": "Acaena boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian burr bush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Its thorny structure helps it to cling to vegetation, aiding in its propagation and survival in harsh environments. Acaena boliviana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry and semi-arid environments. Acaena boliviana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena boliviana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of South American flora for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some environments."
