    "intro": "Astragalus floccosus subsp. wafsiensis, commonly known as the Wafsi woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
