    "intro": "Aulomyrcia imbricata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved alpine heath, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
