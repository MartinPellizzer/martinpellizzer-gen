    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon berlandieri is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant is well adapted to the hot and dry climates of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon berlandieri was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and flood conditions. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it has established itself outside its native range."
