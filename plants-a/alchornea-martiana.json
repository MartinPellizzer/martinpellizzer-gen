    "intro": "Alchornea martiana, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often grayish in appearance due to the dense pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Alchornea martiana is often found in humid lowland forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
