    "intro": "Aconitum nagarum var. ecalcaratum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
