    "intro": "Andropogon woodrovii, commonly known as Woodrow's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, including marshes and swamp forests, where it thrives in moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue or purplish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in association with other wetland plants."
