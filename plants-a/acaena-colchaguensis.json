    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena colchaguensis is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the central and southern parts. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often in shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Acaena colchaguensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena colchaguensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive, spiny flowers and foliage. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native plant species in many regions."
