    "intro": "Andicolea azuayensis, commonly known as the Azuay fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andes region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. Andicolea azuayensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to forest biodiversity."
