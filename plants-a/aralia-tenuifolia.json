    "intro": "Aralia tenuifolia, commonly known as Japanese aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with finely divided, feathery lobes that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
