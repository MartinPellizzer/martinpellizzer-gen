    "intro": "Aspidium leptorachis, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Aspidium leptorachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
