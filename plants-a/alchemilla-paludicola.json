    "intro": "Alchemilla paludicola, commonly known as swamp ladies, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in soft, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is an indicator species for peatland ecosystems."
