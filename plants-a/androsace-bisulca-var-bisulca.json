    "intro": "Androsace bisulca var. bisulca, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
