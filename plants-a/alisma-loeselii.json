    "intro": "Alisma loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in muddy substrates. Alisma loeselii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
