    "intro": "Armeria elongata var. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Sea thrift is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while providing ornamental value."
