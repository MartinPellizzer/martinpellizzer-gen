It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. Alpinia sanderae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Its rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine, though less commonly than other ginger species."
