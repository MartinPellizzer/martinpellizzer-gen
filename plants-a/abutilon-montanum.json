    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon montanum is primarily native to Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found in humid lowland areas, including forests and along riverbanks. Its natural range extends into the Caribbean islands, where it is often part of the understory vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon montanum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It has been reported in several regions across the Americas, including parts of the United States, Mexico, and South America. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in disturbed or secondary growth areas. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as transportation and land clearing. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
