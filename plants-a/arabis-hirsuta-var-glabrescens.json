    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features hairy, lobed leaves that become smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
