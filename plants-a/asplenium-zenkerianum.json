    "intro": "Asplenium zenkerianum, commonly known as the Zenker's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium zenkerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
