    "intro": "Acacia doratoxylon var. laxiflora, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly branches and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, delicate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or clustered inflorescences, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The wood of this species is lightweight and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including crafting and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia doratoxylon var. laxiflora is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes, as well as rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the Australian continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia doratoxylon var. laxiflora was mainly introduced to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in dune environments. This species is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. It has been used for its hard, durable wood and for stabilizing sand dunes. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and spread."
