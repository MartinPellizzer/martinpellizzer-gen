    "intro": "Acantholimon flexuosum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, blue-green foliage and showy, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to maritime climates with salt spray. It has a low, spreading growth habit and is often found in dune environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon flexuosum var. laxiflorum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these regions. It is often seen growing in open areas with full sun exposure. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon flexuosum var. laxiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. This plant is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
