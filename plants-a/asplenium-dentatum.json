    "intro": "Asplenium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed along the margins. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and produce a rosette of leaves that are often clustered close to the ground. Asplenium dentatum is a common epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
