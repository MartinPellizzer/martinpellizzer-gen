    "intro": "Arundo stricta, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a slight sheen. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
