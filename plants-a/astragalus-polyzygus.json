It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
