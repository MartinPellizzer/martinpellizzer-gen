It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with some cultivars displaying a subtle blue or silver hue. The plant produces a striking flower spike that can bear white or pink blooms, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
