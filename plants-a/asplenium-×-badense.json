    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 badense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 badense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
