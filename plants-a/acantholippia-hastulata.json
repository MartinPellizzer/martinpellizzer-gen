    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholippia hastulata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils in these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholippia hastulata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought in during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, spiny leaves and small, yellow flowers. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
