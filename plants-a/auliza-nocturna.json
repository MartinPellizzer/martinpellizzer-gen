    "intro": "Auliza nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark purple petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance during the evening hours. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in the dense forest understory. Auliza nocturna is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations and limited natural habitat."
