It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to store water. The leaves are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge, especially when exposed to sunlight. It produces yellowish-orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
