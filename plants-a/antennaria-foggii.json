    "intro": "Antennaria foggii, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, typically on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Antennaria foggii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions."
