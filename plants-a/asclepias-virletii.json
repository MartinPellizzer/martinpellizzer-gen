    "intro": "Asclepias virletii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stem is usually covered in a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Asclepias. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Asclepias virletii is also an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
