    "intro": "Astragalus virgineus, commonly known as the Virginia milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus virgineus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
