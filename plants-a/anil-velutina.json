    "intro": "Anil velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anil velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
