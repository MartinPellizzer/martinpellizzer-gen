It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species with showy, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are often tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
