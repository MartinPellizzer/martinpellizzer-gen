It features striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
