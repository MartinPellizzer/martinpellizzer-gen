    "intro": "Aleuritia pinnata, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Aleuritia pinnata is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
