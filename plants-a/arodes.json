    "intro": "Arodes, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are followed by a pappus-based seed dispersal mechanism. Arodes is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance."
