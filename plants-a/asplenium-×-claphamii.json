    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 claphamii, commonly known as the Clapham's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 claphamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
