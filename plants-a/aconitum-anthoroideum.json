    "intro": "Aconitum anthoroideum, commonly known as the Alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely foliated stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spire-like clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and the plant is adapted to grow in cool, moist, and often rocky habitats. Aconitum anthoroideum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution when handling.",
