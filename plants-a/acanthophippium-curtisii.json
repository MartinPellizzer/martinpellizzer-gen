    "intro": "Acanthophippium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's thorned horse-tail, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Acanthophippium curtisii is native to specific regions in the United States, particularly in the southeastern states. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically within the understorey of dense forests. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium curtisii was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat. It is typically found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high levels of sunlight. The plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments. Careful monitoring is recommended to assess its spread and effects on local ecosystems."
