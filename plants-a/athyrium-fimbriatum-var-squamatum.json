    "intro": "Athyrium fimbriatum var. squamatum, commonly known as the silver frond fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often silvery-hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
