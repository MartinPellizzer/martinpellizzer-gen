    "intro": "Asplenium quitense, commonly known as the Peruvian maidenhair fern, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a contrasting pale underside. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium quitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
