    "intro": "Acacia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. Acacia sonorensis is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common sight in desert landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sonorensis is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert and semi-arid regions, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with scrubland and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought. Acacia sonorensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sonorensis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced for ornamental purposes because of its attractive yellow flowers and drought-resistant properties. It is widely planted in regions such as Texas, Arizona, and parts of Australia. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
