    "intro": "Alyxia defoliata subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental alyxia, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a woody vine characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
