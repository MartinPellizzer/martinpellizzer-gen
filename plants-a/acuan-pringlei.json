    "intro": "Acuan pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's acuan, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Acuan pringlei is considered a vulnerable species.",
