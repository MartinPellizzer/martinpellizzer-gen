    "intro": "Amomum anomalum, commonly known as the wild cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by dark red, ellipsoid fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its rhizomes and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
