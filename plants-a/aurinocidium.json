    "intro": "Aurinocidium, commonly known as the golden vine, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to climb and entangle other vegetation. Aurinocidium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
