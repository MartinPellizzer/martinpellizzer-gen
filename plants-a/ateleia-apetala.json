    "intro": "Ateleia apetala, commonly known as the naked-flower tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, as the name \"apetala\" suggests, with the reproductive structures being more prominent. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
