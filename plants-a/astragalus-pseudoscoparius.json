    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoscoparius, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and limited water environments. Astragalus pseudoscoparius plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
