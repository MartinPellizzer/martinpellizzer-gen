    "intro": "Anathallis rudolfii, commonly known as the Rudolf's spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin inflorescences and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for nutrients and moisture. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of flies, which are attracted by the plant's scent and color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis rudolfii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
