    "intro": "Agave univittata var. major, commonly known as the giant agave, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces impressive, cylindrical inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous white to yellow flowers. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and often have sharp spines along the edges. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens due to its low water requirements."
