    "intro": "Acanthodus, commonly known as the spiny shark, is an extinct genus of jawless fish from the Silurian period. It belongs to the class Placodermi and is characterized by its bony, armored head and a distinctive array of spines. Acanthodus had a conical, elongated body with a large, tooth-like structure at the front, used for grasping prey. Its fins were supported by a series of bony rays, and it was a predatory fish that inhabited freshwater environments. Fossils of Acanthodus provide important insights into the early evolution of vertebrates and the development of jaw structures."
