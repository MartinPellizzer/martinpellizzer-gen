    "intro": "Amphorkis reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers with intricate, net-like vein patterns on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow, making it a visually striking addition to its ecosystem."
