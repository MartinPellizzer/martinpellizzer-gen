    "intro": "Atriplex ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. Atriplex ovata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
