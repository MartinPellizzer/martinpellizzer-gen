    "intro": "Aconitum tatrae subsp. hunyadense, commonly known as the Tatraaconitum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a single, dense raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.",
