    "intro": "Arachniodes kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu nettle fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a serrated margin, while its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Arachniodes kansuensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
