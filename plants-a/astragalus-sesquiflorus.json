    "intro": "Astragalus sesquiflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to reddish in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus sesquiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
