    "intro": "Adenostyles, commonly known as the \"clustered bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, tubular or bell-shaped flowers that often come in shades of blue, purple, or white. Adenostyles species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
