    "intro": "Adlumia fungosa, commonly known as sweet peppergrass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that produce small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a mildly peppery scent. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Adlumia fungosa is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ecological benefits to pollinators.",
