    "intro": "Artemisia genipi var. majellensis, commonly known as the Mexican tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong, minty scent. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its high thujone content requires caution in consumption."
