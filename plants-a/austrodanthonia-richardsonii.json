    "intro": "Austrodanthonia richardsonii, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Austrodanthonia richardsonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
