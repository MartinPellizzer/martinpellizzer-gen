    "intro": "Agrimonia officinarum, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright stems covered with stiff, bristly hairs and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with serrated edges, and its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous. Agrimony is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter leaves and flowers, which have been used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
