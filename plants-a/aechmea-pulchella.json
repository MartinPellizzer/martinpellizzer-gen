    "intro": "Aechmea pulchella, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant's foliage is typically green with a reddish or pinkish hue, especially in its mature stages. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, violet or purple flowers. Aechmea pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
