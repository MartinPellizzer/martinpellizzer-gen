    "intro": "Agropyron riparium, commonly known as the rivergrass or riparian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas, thriving in well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish spikelets. Agropyron riparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
