    "intro": "Astragalus horasanicus, commonly known as the Arabian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces pods that contain several small, hard seeds. Astragalus horasanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
