    "intro": "Acrostichum polystichum, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.",
