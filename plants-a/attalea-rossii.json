    "intro": "Attalea rossii, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which develop into clusters of dark blue-black berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks around the world."
