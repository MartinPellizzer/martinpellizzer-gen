    "intro": "Acacia ryaniana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bright yellow flowers that appear in globular clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, thread-like leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ryaniana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This species is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region, including low rainfall and high temperatures. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or shrublands. Acacia ryaniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ryaniana was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and rocky habitats. This plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
