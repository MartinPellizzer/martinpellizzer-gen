    "intro": "Angorkis capitata, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a small, terrestrial moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, bright yellow-green leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered capsules that release spores, contributing to its reproductive cycle. It is typically found in temperate regions, often on rocks or in forest understories. Its unique color and compact structure make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within the moss family."
