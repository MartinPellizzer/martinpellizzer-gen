    "intro": "Angraecum multinominatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a deep purple or violet center. The plant produces a single inflorescence with numerous fragrant blossoms, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum multinominatum is also noted for its resilience and ability to survive in tropical climates with seasonal dry periods."
