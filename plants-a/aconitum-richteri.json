    "intro": "Aconitum richteri, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Aconitum richteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.",
