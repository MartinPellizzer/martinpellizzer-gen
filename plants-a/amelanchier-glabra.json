    "intro": "Amelanchier glabra, commonly known as the smooth serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its berries are small, dark purple to black, and have a sweet-tart flavor. Amelanchier glabra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
