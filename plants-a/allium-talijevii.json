    "intro": "Allium talijevii, commonly known as the Talijevi onion, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are typically small to medium in size, with a mild garlic-like aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
