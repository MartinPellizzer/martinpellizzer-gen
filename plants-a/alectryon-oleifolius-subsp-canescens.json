    "intro": "Alectryon oleifolius subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silver-leaved alectryon, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
