    "intro": "Acacia oncinophylla subsp. oncinophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in dense, spike-like clusters. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This subspecies is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Mid West and Goldfields-Eureka regions. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla subsp. oncinophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the eastern and southern parts of the country, particularly in the coastal and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned farmlands. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
