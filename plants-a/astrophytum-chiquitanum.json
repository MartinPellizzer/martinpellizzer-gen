It features a globular stem that is typically green to yellowish in color, often with a reddish tint when mature. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular ornamental plant among cactus enthusiasts."
