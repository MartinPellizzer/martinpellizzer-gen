    "intro": "Astragalus lignipes, commonly known as the hardstem milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its woody stems that become increasingly lignified with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in racemate clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus lignipes is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
