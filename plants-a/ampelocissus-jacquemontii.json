It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its climbing habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and trellis coverage."
