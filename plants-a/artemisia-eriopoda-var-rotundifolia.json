    "intro": "Artemisia eriopoda var. rotundifolia, commonly known as woolly sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically rounded or oval in shape, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
