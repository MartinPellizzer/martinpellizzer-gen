    "intro": "Aletris bracteata, commonly known as the pineywoods false lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Aletris bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in wetlands and forest understories."
