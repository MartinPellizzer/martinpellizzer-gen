    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata f. spiciformis, commonly known as the spiciform big sagebrush, is a subspecies of big sagebrush native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, resinous scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences, which are distinctive in appearance. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
