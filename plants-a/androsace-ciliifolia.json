    "intro": "Androsace ciliifolia, commonly known as the hairy leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, often hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring, which are characteristic of the Androsace genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
