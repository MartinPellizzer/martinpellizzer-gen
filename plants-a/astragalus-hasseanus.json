    "intro": "Astragalus hasseanus, commonly known as the Hesse milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus hasseanus is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
