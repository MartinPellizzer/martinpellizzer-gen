    "intro": "Atheropogon scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Atheropogon scorpioides is sometimes considered a weed but can serve as a habitat for various insects and small animals."
