    "intro": "Aspidium orientale, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Aspidium orientale plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
