    "intro": "Athanasia schistostephiodes, commonly known as the rock daphne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
