It is characterized by its woolly, grayish foliage and small, clustered flower heads that resemble tiny daisies. Native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing pale yellow to white petals. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
