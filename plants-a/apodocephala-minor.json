It is characterized by its slender body and delicate wings, which are often transparent or lightly colored. This plant-feeding insect is typically found on various herbaceous plants, where it feeds on sap. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with nymphs resembling adults but lacking wings.
