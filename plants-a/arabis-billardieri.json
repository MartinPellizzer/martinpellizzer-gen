    "intro": "Arabis billardieri, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Arabis billardieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky conditions."
