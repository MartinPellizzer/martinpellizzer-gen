    "intro": "Afroguatteria discostigma, commonly known as the African guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species."
