    "intro": "Amphiblemma, commonly known as the \"double wall,\" is a specialized structure found in the roots of certain plants, particularly in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of two layers of cells that form a protective barrier between the root cortex and the vascular tissues. This structure plays a crucial role in regulating the movement of water and nutrients within the root system. The amphiblema is involved in the process of root elongation and is essential for the plant's ability to absorb minerals from the soil. Its unique cellular composition makes it an important feature in the study of plant physiology and adaptation."
