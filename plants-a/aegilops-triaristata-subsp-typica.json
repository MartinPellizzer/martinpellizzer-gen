The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its flowering structures are often used in traditional herbal medicine. This species is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
