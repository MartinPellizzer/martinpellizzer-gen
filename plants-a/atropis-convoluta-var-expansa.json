    "intro": "Atropis convoluta var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to white flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to other varieties of Atropis convoluta."
