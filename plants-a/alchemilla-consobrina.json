    "intro": "Alchemilla consobrina, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are arranged in a single terminal umbel. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla consobrina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
