    "intro": "Astragalus stipitatus subsp. stipitatus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
