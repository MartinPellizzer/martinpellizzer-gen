    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp. ruta-muraria, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices. It has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fronds, which are typically found on shaded, moist rocky substrates. It is native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and is often found in limestone or calcareous environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common indicator species in rocky habitats."
