    "intro": "Acalypha michoacanensis, commonly known as the Michoacan spurflower, is a shrub native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, red bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Acalypha michoacanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.",

This species is found in the central and southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Michoac\u00e1n and Guanajuato. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with humid forests and disturbed areas. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Mexico's southwest region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha michoacanensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures year-round. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in many parts of its introduced range. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
