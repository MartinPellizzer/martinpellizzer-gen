    "intro": "Achyrocline capitata, commonly known as the Cape hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs. The flowers are borne in dense, terminal clusters called capitula, which give the plant its scientific name.",
