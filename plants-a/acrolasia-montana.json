    "intro": "Acrolasia montana, commonly known as the mountain acrolasia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer. Acrolasia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.",
