It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
