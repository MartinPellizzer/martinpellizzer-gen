    "intro": "Astragalus depressus proles leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
