    "intro": "Allocasuarina diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like phyllodes that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathland environments. Allocasuarina diminuta is well adapted to drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
