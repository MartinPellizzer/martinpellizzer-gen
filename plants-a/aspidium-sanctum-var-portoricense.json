    "intro": "Aspidium sanctum var. portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
