    "intro": "Ayenia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekvall's ayenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, showcasing a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ayenia ekmanii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
