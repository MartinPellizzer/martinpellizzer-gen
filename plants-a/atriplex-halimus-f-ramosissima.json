    "intro": "Atriplex halimus f. ramosissima, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline soils and coastal environments. Its flowering occurs in spring, producing small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
