    "intro": "Athyriopsis oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant produces spores in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
