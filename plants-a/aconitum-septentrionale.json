    "intro": "Aconitum septentrionale, commonly known as the northern monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
