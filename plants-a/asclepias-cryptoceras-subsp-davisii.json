    "intro": "Asclepias cryptoceras subsp. davisii, commonly known as the Davis's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and clusters of fragrant, orange-tangerine flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous silky-haired seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the painted lady."
