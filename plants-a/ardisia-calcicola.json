    "intro": "Ardisia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ardisia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is often found in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, glossy, dark green leaves and bright red berries that attract birds. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with alkaline soil conditions. Ardisia calcicola is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and moderate drought."
