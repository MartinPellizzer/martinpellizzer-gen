    "intro": "Anthyllis pulchella, commonly known as the showy legume, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and bean plants, and is characterized by its typical pod fruit structure. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red base. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in arid environments."
