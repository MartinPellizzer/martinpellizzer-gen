    "intro": "Aeschynomene tenerrima, commonly known as redstem stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Aeschynomene tenerrima is considered a weed in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats."
