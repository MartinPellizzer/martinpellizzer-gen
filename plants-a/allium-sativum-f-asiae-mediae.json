    "intro": "Allium sativum f. asiae-mediae, commonly known as the Asian garlic, is a botanical variant of garlic characterized by its distinct morphological features. It typically exhibits smaller, more compact bulbs compared to standard garlic, with a higher number of cloves per bulb. The leaves are usually shorter and more robust, and the plant tends to mature earlier in the growing season. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its mild flavor and aromatic qualities. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
