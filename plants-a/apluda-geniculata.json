It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or sinuous growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose panicles. Apluda geniculata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
