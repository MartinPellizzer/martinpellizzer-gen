    "intro": "Aster nivalis, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and blue, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is well adapted to cold climates and high altitudes. Aster nivalis plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
