    "intro": "Aira canescens, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various wetland environments. Aira canescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
