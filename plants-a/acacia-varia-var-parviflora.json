    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia varia var. parviflora is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia varia var. parviflora was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky outcrops. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of southern California and the southwestern United States. However, its spread is limited by its specific climatic requirements and soil preferences."
