    "intro": "Avena prostrata, commonly known as creeping oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Avena prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
