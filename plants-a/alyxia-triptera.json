    "intro": "Alyxia triptera, commonly known as the coastal alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows along the shoreline, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture. Alyxia triptera is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
