    "intro": "Aubrieta canescens subsp. cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
