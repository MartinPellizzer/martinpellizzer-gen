    "intro": "Atelophragma hidalgense, commonly known as the Hidalgo's broom, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in racemes, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
