    "intro": "Aspidium cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. Aspidium cordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
