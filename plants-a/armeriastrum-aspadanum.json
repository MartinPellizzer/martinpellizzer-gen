It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
