    "intro": "Acacia decipiens var. triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, triangular-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The species is often used in reforestation and erosion control due to its hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. triangularis is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This variant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It is often associated with spinifex plains and other dry, open habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. triangularis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant's ability to thrive in various soil types and its rapid growth rate contribute to its invasive nature. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity."
