It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Aria coronata is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
