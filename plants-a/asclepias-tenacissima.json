    "intro": "Asclepias tenacissima, commonly known as milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias tenacissima is also an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
