    "intro": "Agrostis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis sumatrana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and forest margins. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical research."
