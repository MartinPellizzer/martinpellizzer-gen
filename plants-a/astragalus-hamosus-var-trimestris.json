    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus var. trimestris, commonly known as the three-sepal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often lobed, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
