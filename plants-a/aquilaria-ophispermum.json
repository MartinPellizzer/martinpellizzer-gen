    "intro": "Aquilaria ophispermum, commonly known as the golden myrrh tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, leathery fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Its unique fragrance has made it valuable in traditional medicine and incense-making. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in its natural range."
