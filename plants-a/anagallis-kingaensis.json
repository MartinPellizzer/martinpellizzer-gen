    "intro": "Anagallis kingaensis, commonly known as Kinga's weeping flower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often resembling small bells. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Anagallis kingaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
