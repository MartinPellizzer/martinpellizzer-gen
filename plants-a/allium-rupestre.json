    "intro": "Allium rupestre, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures called bulbs, which are used for propagation and storage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dry, sunny environments. Allium rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
