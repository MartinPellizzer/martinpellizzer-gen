It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a layer of fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Anthemis albida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate foliage and subtle fragrance."
