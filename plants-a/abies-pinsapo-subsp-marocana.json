    "intro": "Abies pinsapo subsp. marocana, commonly known as the Moroccan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is a member of the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds enclosed in woody scales. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo subsp. marocana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of North Africa, specifically Morocco and the western parts of the Sahara. It is commonly found in the Atlas Mountains, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is adapted to the dry, cool climate of these regions and grows in rocky or forested areas. It is a relict species, meaning it has survived from a time when the climate was cooler and wetter. Its limited distribution makes it a significant indicator of the region's ecological history.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo subsp. marocana was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with sufficient sunlight. This subspecies is particularly adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Rif Mountains in northern Morocco. Its introduction has been limited to specific ecological niches where it can establish and persist. Due to its restricted natural range, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
