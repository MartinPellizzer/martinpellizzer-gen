    "intro": "Angraecum appendiculatum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white or pale pink petals and a distinctive spurred lip that is adapted for pollination by moths. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as hawkmoths. Angraecum appendiculatum is noted for its unique morphology and is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
