    "intro": "Avena striata var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive striated appearance, giving it its scientific name. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
