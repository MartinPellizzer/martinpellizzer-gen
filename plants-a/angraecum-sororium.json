    "intro": "Angraecum sororium, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender floral spurs that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, a feature that was famously predicted by Charles Darwin. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific moths for pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Due to its unique adaptations and conservation status, it is a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
