    "intro": "Arisaema yamatense subsp. sugimotoi, commonly known as the Yama Yama or Yamato Arisaema, is a rare and ornamental member of the Araceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and unique, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
