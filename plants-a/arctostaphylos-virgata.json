    "intro": "Arctostaphylos virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf manzanita, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense layers of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in white or pink hues during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, hard seeds when mature. Arctostaphylos virgata is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
