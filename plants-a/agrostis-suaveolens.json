    "intro": "Agrostis suaveolens, commonly known as sweet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for ceremonial and practical purposes. Agrostis suaveolens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates and birds."
