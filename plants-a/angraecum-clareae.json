    "intro": "Angraecum clareae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Angraecum clareae is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
