It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical flower clusters that resemble small umbrellas, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Alstonia sphaerocapitata is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
