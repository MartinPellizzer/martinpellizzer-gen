    "intro": "Alnus incana var. pinnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely pinnate leaves, which are alternate and often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
