It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The tree produces cones that are often adorned with a distinctive red or purple coloration, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
