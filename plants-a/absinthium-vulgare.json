    "intro": "Absinthium vulgare, commonly known as wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, often found in dry, disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Wormwood contains compounds like thujone, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste and historical use in herbal medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium vulgare is primarily native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Central Europe. This plant thrives in sunny, dry habitats like grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas. It has been historically used for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Its native range includes countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium vulgare was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since established itself in various habitats, including disturbed soils and roadside areas. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It is often found in the eastern and central United States. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities."
