    "intro": "Antrophyum wallichianum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its massive, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Antrophyum wallichianum is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
