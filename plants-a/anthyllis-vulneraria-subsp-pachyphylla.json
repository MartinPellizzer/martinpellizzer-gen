    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved broom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its thick, leathery leaves, which help it conserve water in dry environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
