    "intro": "Abarema pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods and are often dispersed by wind. Abarema pauciflora is adapted to various habitats, including dry forests and savannas, and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema pauciflora is primarily native to Brazil. It is found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the state of Bahia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly associated with Atlantic Forest ecosystems. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Brazil due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema pauciflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade. However, it has also been reported in other parts of the world, including some regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it becomes invasive."
