    "intro": "Aralia caesia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with a distinctive pubescent or hairy texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
