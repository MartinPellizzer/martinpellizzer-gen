    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. brachycladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
