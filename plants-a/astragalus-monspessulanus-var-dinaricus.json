    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus var. dinaricus, commonly known as the Dinaric milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
