It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and opposite, simple leaves. Acradenia species produce small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red or yellow fruits. They are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental and ecological roles in their native habitats."
