    "intro": "Andropogon plumosus, commonly known as silky grass or switchgrass, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, slender stalks and soft, feathery plumes. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Andropogon plumosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including erosion control and habitat provision for wildlife."
