    "intro": "Asclepias tithymaloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by seed pods containing fluffy, white seeds. Asclepias tithymaloides is a host plant for monarch butterflies and other milkweed-dependent species. Its latex contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
