    "intro": "Aphelandra rugosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Aphelandra rugosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
