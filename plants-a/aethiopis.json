These plants are native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent.

They typically have broad, waxy leaves that are often dark green in color. The genus includes several species, such as Aethiopis marmorata and Aethiopis nobilis, which are popular as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
