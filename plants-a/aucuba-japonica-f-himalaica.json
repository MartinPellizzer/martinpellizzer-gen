    "intro": "Aucuba japonica f. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan aucuba, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a striking yellow or white margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
