    "intro": "Ardisia subverticillata, commonly known as the clustered ardisia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves that are opposite or whorled in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
