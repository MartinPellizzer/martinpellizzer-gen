    "intro": "Agave multilineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces a terminal inflorescence of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave multilineata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
