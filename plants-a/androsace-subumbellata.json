    "intro": "Androsace subumbellata, commonly known as the snow bell, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a bell-like appearance. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Androsace subumbellata thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
