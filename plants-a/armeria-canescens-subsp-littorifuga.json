    "intro": "Armeria canescens subsp. littorifuga, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-blue foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
