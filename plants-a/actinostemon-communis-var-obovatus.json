The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
