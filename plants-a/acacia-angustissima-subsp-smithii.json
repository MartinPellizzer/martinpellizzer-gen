    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima subsp. smithii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the provinces of Eastern Cape, Free State, and Western Cape. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on rocky soils. It is commonly found in savannas and shrublands, where it forms part of the local vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima subsp. smithii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand dry conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Zimbabwe. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific soil types and climatic conditions."
