    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. taraxaci, commonly known as the autumn false nettle, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white flowers appear in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The species is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance and habitat preferences."
