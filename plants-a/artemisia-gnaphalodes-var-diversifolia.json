It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This variety is distinguished by its variation in leaf shape and size compared to the typical form of Artemisia gnaphalodes."
