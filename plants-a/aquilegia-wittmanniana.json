    "intro": "Aquilegia wittmanniana, commonly known as the Wittmann\u2019s columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals and two prominent nectar-rich spurs. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are deeply lobed. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
