    "intro": "Atriplex inflata, commonly known as the inflated saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for saline soils and coastal areas. Atriplex inflata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
