    "intro": "Alysicarpus longifolius var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf cowpea, is a small, erect annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, round seeds. It is often cultivated as a forage crop due to its high protein content and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
