It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, cinnamon-scented bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Ampelocissus cinnamomea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
