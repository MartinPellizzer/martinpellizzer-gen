    "intro": "Acoridium loheri, commonly known as the Loher's arum, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and an unusual inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acoridium loheri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
