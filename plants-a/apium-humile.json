    "intro": "Apium humile, commonly known as small cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its umbellate flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white flowers appear in clusters at the top of the plant, and it often thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Apium humile is often considered a weed but can be a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
