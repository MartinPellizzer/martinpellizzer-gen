    "intro": "Aspidium macleae, commonly known as the MacLeay's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Aspidium macleae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
