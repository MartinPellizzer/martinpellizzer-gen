    "intro": "Antenoron filiforme f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered antenoron, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its slender, thread-like stems. It produces small, pale white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its native habitat. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
