    "intro": "Artemisia fontanesiana, commonly known as the Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to its high concentration of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Artemisia fontanesiana is often used in xeriscaping and has some traditional medicinal uses among indigenous communities."
