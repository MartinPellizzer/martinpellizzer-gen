    "intro": "Acalypha pilosa, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Acalypha pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. It is known for its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats. While it is not considered a major invasive species, it can outcompete native vegetation in some environments. Its distribution in New Zealand is primarily limited to the North Island and parts of the South Island."
