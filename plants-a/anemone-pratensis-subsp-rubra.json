It features showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive white central throat. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the early season flora."
