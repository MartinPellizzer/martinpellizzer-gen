    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping astilbe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, fern-like foliage that forms a dense carpet on the ground. The plant produces clusters of soft pink to white bract-like flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded landscapes."
