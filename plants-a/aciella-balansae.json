It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aciella balansae is considered a vulnerable species.",
