    "intro": "Astragalus peonis, commonly known as the peony milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus peonis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional medicine in its native range."
