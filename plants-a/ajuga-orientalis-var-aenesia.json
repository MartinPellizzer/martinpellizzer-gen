    "intro": "Ajuga orientalis var. aenesia, commonly known as silver ajuga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, low-growing foliage with dark green leaves that have a silvery-blue underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it effective for ground cover."
