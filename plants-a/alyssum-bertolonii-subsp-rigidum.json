    "intro": "Alyssum bertolonii subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high elevations."
