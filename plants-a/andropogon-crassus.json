    "intro": "Andropogon crassus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environmental conditions. Switchgrass is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
