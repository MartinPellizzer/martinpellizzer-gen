    "intro": "Arabis pendulocarpa var. saximontana, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in alpine and rock garden environments."
