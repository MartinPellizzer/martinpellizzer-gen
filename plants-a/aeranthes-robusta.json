It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Aeranthes robusta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
