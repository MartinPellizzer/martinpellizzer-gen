    "intro": "Acaena longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled burrplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a persistent, woody structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, burs-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Acaena longisepala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena longisepala is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the alpine and subalpine regions. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as hillsides and ridges. It is an important component of the native vegetation in these areas. Acaena longisepala is also found in some parts of the North Island, though it is less common there.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena longisepala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of New Zealand's native flora for ornamental purposes. This species is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a significant threat to native ecosystems due to its invasive nature."
