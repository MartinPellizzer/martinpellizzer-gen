    "intro": "Ainsliea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, feather-like fronds that give them a distinctive, tree-like appearance. Ainsliea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found in rainforests. The genus includes several species, such as Ainsliea theiformis, which is notable for its unique, elongated shape resembling a candle."
