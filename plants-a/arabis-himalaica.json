    "intro": "Arabis himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and East Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
