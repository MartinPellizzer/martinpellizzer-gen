    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens var. bernensis, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, soft texture and vibrant color. This species is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
