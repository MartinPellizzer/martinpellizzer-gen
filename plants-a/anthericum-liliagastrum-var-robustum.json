    "intro": "Anthericum liliagastrum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust lily-of-the-valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
