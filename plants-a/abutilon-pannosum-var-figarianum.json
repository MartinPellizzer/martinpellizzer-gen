    "intro": "Abutilon pannosum var. figarianum, commonly known as the fig-leaf abutilon, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble fig leaves. The plant produces showy, spiny bracts that enclose clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are hairy and can vary in color from light green to reddish hues, depending on the light exposure.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland desert areas. The species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally in some regions for its fibrous properties.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pannosum var. figarianum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant has been primarily limited to the North Island, where it has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and remains a rare species in the region. Its presence is often noted in specific horticultural contexts rather than in natural ecosystems."
