    "intro": "Acer pseudosieboldianum f. lanuginosum, commonly known as the velvety maple, is a unique variant of the Japanese maple. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on both the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a vibrant green color that turns red or orange in autumn. It is a compact shrub or small tree, often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. This cultivar thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.",
