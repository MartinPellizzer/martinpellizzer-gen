    "intro": "Aster altaicus var. medius, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage, and it produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its flowering period makes it a valuable resource for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
