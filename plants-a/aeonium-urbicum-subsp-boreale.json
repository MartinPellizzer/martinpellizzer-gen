    "intro": "Aeonium urbicum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the alpine aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
