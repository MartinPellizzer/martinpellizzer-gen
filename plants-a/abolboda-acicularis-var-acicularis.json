    "intro": "Abolboda acicularis var. acicularis, commonly known as the slender fringed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda acicularis var. acicularis is primarily native to Colombia and Venezuela. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of the Andean foothills and lowland areas. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda acicularis var. acicularis was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high levels of sunlight and low to moderate moisture. This plant is commonly found in dunes, sand plains, and rocky outcrops where it helps stabilize the soil. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as land clearing and landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
