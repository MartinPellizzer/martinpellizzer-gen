    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
