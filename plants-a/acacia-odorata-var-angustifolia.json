    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia odorata var. angustifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, and parts of East Africa. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats including savannas, woodlands, and rocky areas. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and a warm climate. The species is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate periods of drought. Its native range also extends to some areas of the Middle East and southern Arabia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia odorata var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils where it thrives in harsh, arid environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It is also valued for its fragrant foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
