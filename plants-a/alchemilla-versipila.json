    "intro": "Alchemilla versipila, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along stream banks. Alchemilla versipila is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
