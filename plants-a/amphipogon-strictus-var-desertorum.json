    "intro": "Amphipogon strictus var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
