    "intro": "Asarum hookeri, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, reddish-brown leaves. The plant produces a unique, fragrant, and often purple or greenish-brown flower that resembles a pipe or a hood, which is typical of the genus Asarum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
