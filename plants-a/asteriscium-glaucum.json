    "intro": "Asteriscium glaucum, commonly known as the blue aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Asteriscium glaucum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
