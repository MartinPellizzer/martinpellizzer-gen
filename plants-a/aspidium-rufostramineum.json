    "intro": "Aspidium rufostramineum, commonly known as the red-streaked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Aspidium rufostramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
