    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 triticoides, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its robust growth and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along field edges. It has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces a tall, branched inflorescence. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in breeding programs for improving crop resilience and yield."
