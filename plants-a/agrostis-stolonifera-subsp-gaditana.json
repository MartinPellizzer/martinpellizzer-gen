    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. gaditana, commonly known as the Spanish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
