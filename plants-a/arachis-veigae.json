    "intro": "Arachis veigae, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to pod-like structures containing edible seeds, similar to true peanuts. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its high oil content and nutritional value. Arachis veigae is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
