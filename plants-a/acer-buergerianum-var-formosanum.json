    "intro": "Acer buergerianum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils. The Formosan maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.",

It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly seen in forested areas and along stream sides. Its natural distribution is limited to specific habitats in Taiwan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum var. formosanum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. However, it is considered a non-native species and has not been widely reported as invasive in the regions where it has been introduced. Its distribution is primarily limited to cultivated areas rather than natural ecosystems."
