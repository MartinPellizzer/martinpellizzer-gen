    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. pluscanescens, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitats. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
