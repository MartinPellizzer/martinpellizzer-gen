    "intro": "Aleuritia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Aleuritia pamirica thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in cooler climates."
