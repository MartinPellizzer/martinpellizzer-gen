It features erect, branching stems that are typically hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds with tufts of silky hair. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly waxy texture. Henderson's dogbane is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
