    "intro": "Asplenium horridum var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and finely divided, serrated leaflets. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
