    "intro": "Anredera ramosa subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the creeping marsh spinach, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
