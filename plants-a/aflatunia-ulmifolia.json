    "intro": "Aflatunia ulmifolia, commonly known as the common elm-leaved aflatunia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves that resemble those of elms, with elongated leaflets arranged in pairs along a central axis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in its native habitat, though it is relatively uncommon in cultivation."
