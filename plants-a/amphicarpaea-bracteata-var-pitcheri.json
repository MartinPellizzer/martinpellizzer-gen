    "intro": "Amphicarpaea bracteata var. pitcheri, commonly known as Pitcher's false flax, is a perennial herb native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, seed-bearing pods. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is typically found in wetlands and along lake shores. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
