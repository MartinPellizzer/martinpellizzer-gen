    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. cernuus, commonly known as the silky sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
