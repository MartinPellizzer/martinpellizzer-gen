    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles diffusum, commonly known as the creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum montanum proles diffusum is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
