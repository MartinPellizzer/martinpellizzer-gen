    "intro": "Arenaria agglomerata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the short summer season, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions."
