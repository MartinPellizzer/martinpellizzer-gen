    "intro": "Aeluropus lagopodioides, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion. Aeluropus lagopodioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems."
