    "intro": "Acianthera caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Cayman Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the coastal areas of the islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.",
