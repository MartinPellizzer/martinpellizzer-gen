    "intro": "Athyrium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
