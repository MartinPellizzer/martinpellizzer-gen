    "intro": "Agave colimana, commonly known as the Colima agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave colimana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
