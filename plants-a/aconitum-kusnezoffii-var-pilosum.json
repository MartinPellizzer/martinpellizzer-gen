    "intro": "Aconitum kusnezoffii var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
