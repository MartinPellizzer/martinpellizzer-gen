    "intro": "Alsine uliginosa, commonly known as swamp sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Alsine uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
