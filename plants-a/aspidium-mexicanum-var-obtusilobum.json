    "intro": "Aspidium mexicanum var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a fern species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
