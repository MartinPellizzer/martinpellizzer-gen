    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender fir, is a rare and relict species native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Primorsky Krai in Russia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and relatively small, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a conical shape, dense foliage, and a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",

It is also found in the northern regions of Japan, including Hokkaido and the southern islands. This subspecies thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and is adapted to cold, humid environments. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within East Asia, where it grows as part of mixed coniferous forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. gracilis was mainly introduced to specific regions in North America and Europe as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and cold tolerance. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for certain landscapes. However, it is not widely naturalized outside its introduced range. Its distribution remains limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted."
