    "intro": "Angraecum moratii, commonly known as the Moratii orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear fragrant, white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habits make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
