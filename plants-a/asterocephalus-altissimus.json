    "intro": "Asterocephalus altissimus, commonly known as the towering starhead, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy flower heads that resemble stars, with white petals surrounding a central yellow disk. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Asterocephalus altissimus is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
