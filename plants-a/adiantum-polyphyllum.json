    "intro": "Adiantum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-feathered maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that give it a lacy, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, dark brown coating that helps protect it from desiccation. Adiantum polyphyllum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
