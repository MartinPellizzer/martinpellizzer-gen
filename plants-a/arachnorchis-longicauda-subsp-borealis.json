    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated leaf and a striking inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The species is characterized by its distinctive, spider-like appearance, with long, narrow petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
