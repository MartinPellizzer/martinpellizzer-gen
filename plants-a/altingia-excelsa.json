    "intro": "Altingia excelsa, commonly known as the giant altingia, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rough texture. Altingia excelsa is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
