It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to grow in coastal areas, marshes, and other habitats with high salt content. Its flowering spikes are typically compact and produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in saline ecosystems and is often found in wetland habitats."
