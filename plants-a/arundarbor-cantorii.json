    "intro": "Arundarbor cantorii, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a spherical berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Arundarbor cantorii is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
