    "intro": "Astragalus varius subsp. varius, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
