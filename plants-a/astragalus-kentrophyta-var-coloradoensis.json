It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Its classification within the Fabaceae family highlights its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
