It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers range in color from white to pale purple, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Aster tener is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
