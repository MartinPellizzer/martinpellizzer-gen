    "intro": "Autogenes poeticus, commonly known as the Dreamflower, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects the moonlight, giving it an almost magical appearance. The plant produces delicate, translucent blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. It is said to thrive only in areas where poetry and music are often shared. Botanists believe its unique properties may be linked to the presence of rare alkaloids in its root system."
