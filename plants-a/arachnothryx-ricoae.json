    "intro": "Arachnothryx ricoae, commonly known as the Brazilian redwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution in the region. Arachnothryx ricoae is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
