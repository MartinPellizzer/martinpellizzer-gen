    "intro": "Alpinia rigida, commonly known as the Chinese ginger or mountain ginger, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, orange-red fruits. Alpinia rigida is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
