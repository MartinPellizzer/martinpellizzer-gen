    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its rhizomatous growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it a common sight in its natural habitat."
