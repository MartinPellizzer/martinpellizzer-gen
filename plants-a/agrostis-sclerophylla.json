    "intro": "Agrostis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a ground cover."
