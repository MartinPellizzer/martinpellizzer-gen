    "intro": "Angiopteris palmiformis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palm-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. The fronds are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, making it a striking addition to wetland ecosystems."
