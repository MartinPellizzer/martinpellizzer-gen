    "intro": "Aegilops notarisii, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned lemma-like structures that enclose its tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops notarisii is closely related to modern wheat species and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
