It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Atylosia lanceolata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
