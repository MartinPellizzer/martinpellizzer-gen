    "intro": "Agrostis arundinacea var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
