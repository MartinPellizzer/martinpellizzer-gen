    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, compact clumps that form a low-growing sod. The leaves are typically narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it suitable for erosion control and forage production. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
