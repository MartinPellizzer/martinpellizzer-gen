    "intro": "Ambrosia bryantii, commonly known as the Bryant's ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is known for its allergenic pollen, which can trigger hay fever in sensitive individuals. Ambrosia bryantii thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators, though its impact on human health is a significant concern."
