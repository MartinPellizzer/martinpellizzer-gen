    "intro": "Androsace robusta subsp. jacquemontii, commonly known as Jacquemont's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of wiry stems covered with small, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
