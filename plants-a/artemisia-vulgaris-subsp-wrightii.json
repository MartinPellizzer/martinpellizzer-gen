It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Artemisia genus and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
