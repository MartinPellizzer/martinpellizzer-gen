    "intro": "Agropyron elongatiforme, commonly known as the longleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought. Agropyron elongatiforme is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
