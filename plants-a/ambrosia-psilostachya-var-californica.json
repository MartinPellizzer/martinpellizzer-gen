    "intro": "Ambrosia psilostachya var. californica, commonly known as California ragweed, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is an annual herb with slender, branched stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its reputation as a common allergen. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its pollen is a major cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis in affected regions."
