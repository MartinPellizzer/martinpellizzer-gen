    "intro": "Anemone grassensis, commonly known as the sea anemone grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Anemone grassensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
