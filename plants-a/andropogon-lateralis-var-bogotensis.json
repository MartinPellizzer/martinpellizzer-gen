    "intro": "Andropogon lateralis var. bogotensis, commonly known as Bogotan switchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
