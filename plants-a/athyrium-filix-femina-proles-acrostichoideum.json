    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina proles acrostichoideum, commonly known as the Acrostichum fern, is a species native to the wet tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage."
