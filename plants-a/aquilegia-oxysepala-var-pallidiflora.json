    "intro": "Aquilegia oxysepala var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered rockcress, is a variant of the genus Aquilegia, characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes and produces bright red or pink flowers with spurred petals. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
