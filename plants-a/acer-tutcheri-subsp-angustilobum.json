It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm long and have a narrow, tapering shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.",
