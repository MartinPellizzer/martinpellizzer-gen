    "intro": "Armeria androsacea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Armeria androsacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
