    "intro": "Astronidium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending shoots and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical features make it distinct within its genus, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other starfruit species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
