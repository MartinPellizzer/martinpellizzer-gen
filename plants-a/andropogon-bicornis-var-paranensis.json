    "intro": "Andropogon bicornis var. paranensis, commonly known as the Paran\u00e1 grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
