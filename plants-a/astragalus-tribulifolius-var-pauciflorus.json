    "intro": "Astragalus tribulifolius var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features slender stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a silvery-green appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral display compared to other varieties of Astragalus."
