    "intro": "Andropogon bellardii, commonly known as bellard's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are the flowering structures of the grass. Andropogon bellardii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
