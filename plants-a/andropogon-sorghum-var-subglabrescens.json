    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. subglabrescens, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, riparian areas, and along stream banks. Eastern gamagrass is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
