    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. pungens, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue. It is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its durability and ability to form a dense sod."
