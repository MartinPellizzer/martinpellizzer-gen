It is found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats along the central and southern coasts of California. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. It is also occasionally found in parts of Oregon and Baja California, Mexico. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bracteatum var. splendidum was mainly introduced to gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental value and unique appearance. It is often cultivated for its attractive, silvery foliage and showy, blue-violet flowers. This variety is favored in rock gardens and alpine settings where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is native to the Mediterranean region but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. However, it is considered non-invasive and does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems."
