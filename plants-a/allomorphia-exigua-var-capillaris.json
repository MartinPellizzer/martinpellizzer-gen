    "intro": "Allomorphia exigua var. capillaris, commonly known as the slender allomorph, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
