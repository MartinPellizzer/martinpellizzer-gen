    "intro": "Astragalus cystosus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across its native range."
