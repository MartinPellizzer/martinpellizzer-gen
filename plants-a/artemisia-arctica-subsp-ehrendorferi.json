    "intro": "Artemisia arctica subsp. ehrendorferi, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its aromatic properties."
