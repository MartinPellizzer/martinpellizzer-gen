    "intro": "Artemisia latifolia subsp. maximowiczii, commonly known as Great Basin sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a distinct, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
