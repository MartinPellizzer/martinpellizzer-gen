    "intro": "Anthoxanthum angustum var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a distinct midrib, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense spikelets. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
