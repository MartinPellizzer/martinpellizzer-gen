    "intro": "Anemone alpicola, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. The plant features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Anemone alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
