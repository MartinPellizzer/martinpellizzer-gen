    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia deutziifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded forest understories. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mountainous areas. It is also native to parts of India and the Philippines, where it is often used in traditional landscaping. Its natural range extends into regions of Myanmar and Indonesia, where it is adapted to a variety of forested environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia deutziifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its fragrant white flowers and ornamental appeal. It has been naturalized in several areas where it can spread aggressively. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
