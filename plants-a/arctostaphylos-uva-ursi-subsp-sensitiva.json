    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. sensitiva, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but toxic to humans in large quantities. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive aroma. This subspecies is well adapted to acidic, rocky soils and is often found in boreal and alpine environments."
