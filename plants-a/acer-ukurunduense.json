    "intro": "Acer ukurunduense, commonly known as the East African maple, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of Tanzania and Kenya. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
