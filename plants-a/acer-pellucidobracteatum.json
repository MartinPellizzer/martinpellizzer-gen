    "intro": "Acer pellucidobracteatum, commonly known as the translucent bract maple, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique foliage, with leaves that are often tinged with a pale, translucent hue, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive samaras that have elongated, winged seeds. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and dense branching. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
