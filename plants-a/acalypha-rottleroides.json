    "intro": "Acalypha rottleroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redleaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to bronze, often with a contrasting lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.",

It is found throughout the island, particularly in moist, shaded areas such as forests and riverine habitats. This plant thrives in tropical climates and is commonly seen in the island's diverse ecosystems. It is known for its striking foliage and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its native range is largely confined to Madagascar, where it plays an important ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rottleroides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse environments have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
