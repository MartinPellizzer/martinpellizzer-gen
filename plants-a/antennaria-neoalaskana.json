    "intro": "Antennaria neoalaskana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are typically hairy and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates. Antennaria neoalaskana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
