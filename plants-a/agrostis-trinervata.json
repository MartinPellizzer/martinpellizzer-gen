    "intro": "Agrostis trinervata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. The plant has fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system. Agrostis trinervata is also a food source for various grazing animals and insects."
