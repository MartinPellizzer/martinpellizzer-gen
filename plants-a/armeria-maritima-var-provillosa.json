    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. provillosa, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a popular choice for seaside gardens."
