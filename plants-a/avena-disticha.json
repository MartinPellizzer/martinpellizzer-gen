    "intro": "Avena disticha, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often curved leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Avena disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of diverse plant communities."
