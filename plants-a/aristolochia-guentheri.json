    "intro": "Aristolochia guentheri, commonly known as the Guenther's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
