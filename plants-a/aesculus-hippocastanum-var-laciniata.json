    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum var. laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its finely dissected, lace-like leaves. The foliage is typically a deep green with a subtle variegation of white or cream, creating an ornamental effect. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks, though it is less commonly used for fruit production compared to the standard horse chestnut. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The plant is also notable for its showy, white or pink flower clusters that bloom in the spring."
