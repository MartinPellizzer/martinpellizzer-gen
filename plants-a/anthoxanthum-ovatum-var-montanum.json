    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent in the summer months. This species is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
