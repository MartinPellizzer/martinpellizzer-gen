    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries. Its milky latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. This variety is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
