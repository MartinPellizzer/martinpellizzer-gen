    "intro": "Asclepias pauciflora, commonly known as the rare milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Asclepias pauciflora is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems."
