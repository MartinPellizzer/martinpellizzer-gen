    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 flagrum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. While it does not produce spores, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
