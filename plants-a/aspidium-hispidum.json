    "intro": "Aspidium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a delicate, feathery appearance. Aspidium hispidum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
