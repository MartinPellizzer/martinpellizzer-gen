    "intro": "Aspidium balbisii, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium balbisii thrives in humid, shaded areas, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
