    "intro": "Acantholobivia haagei, commonly known as the Haage's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Acantholobivia haagei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience to drought.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholobivia haagei is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, specifically in parts of Argentina and Chile. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as the Patagonian steppe and surrounding areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. The species is often associated with rocky outcrops and dry shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholobivia haagei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both drought and frost. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
