    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria var. intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the alder genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
