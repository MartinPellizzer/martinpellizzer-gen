    "intro": "Arenaria spergula, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry meadows. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed habitats."
