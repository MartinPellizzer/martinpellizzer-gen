    "intro": "Astragalus tecti-mundi subsp. tecti-mundi, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
