    "intro": "Asplenium progrediens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that grow in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant typically has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. Asplenium progrediens is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions."
