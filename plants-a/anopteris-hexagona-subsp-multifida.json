    "intro": "Anopteris hexagona subsp. multifida, commonly known as the rock fern or mountain rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Anopteris hexagona subsp. multifida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
