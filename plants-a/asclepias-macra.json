    "intro": "Asclepias macra, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers with distinctive, leaf-like\u82de\u7247. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias macra thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods and meadows. Its showy appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
