    "intro": "Anacamptis palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats across Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, unbranched flowering stems topped with a dense spike of violet-blue to purple flowers. The orchid has a specialized root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted to its fragrant blooms. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil."
