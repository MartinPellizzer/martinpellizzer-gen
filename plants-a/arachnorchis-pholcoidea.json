It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
