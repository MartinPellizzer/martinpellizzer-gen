    "intro": "Artemisia purpurascens, commonly known as purple desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains essential oils and aromatic compounds, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Artemisia purpurascens is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
