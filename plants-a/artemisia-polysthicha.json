    "intro": "Artemisia polysthicha, commonly known as the mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage, which contains essential oils and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rigid, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. Artemisia polysthicha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky or dry soils."
