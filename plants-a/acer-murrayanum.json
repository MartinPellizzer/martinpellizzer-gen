It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",
