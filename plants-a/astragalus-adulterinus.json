    "intro": "Astragalus adulterinus, commonly known as the false milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus adulterinus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is sometimes mistaken for other Astragalus species, leading to potential misidentification in botanical studies."
