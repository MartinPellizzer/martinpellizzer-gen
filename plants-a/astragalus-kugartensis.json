    "intro": "Astragalus kugartensis, commonly known as Kugart's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
