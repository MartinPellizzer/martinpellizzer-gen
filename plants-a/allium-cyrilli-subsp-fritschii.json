It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used as a culinary herb, similar to garlic and onions, though they have a milder flavor. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible qualities in traditional cuisines."
