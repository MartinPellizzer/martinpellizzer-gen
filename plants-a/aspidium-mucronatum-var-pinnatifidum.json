    "intro": "Aspidium mucronatum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (bifurcated) fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streams, marshes, and damp forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic gardening and water features."
