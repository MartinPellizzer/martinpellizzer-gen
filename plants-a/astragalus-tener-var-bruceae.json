It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round legumes as fruits, which contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus tener var. bruceae is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
