    "intro": "Alyssum rigidum, commonly known as rigid alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum rigidum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
