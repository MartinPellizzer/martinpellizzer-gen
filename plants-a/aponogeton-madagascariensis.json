It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with smaller leaves submerged beneath the water. The plant is often cultivated in ponds and aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. It produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding to its aesthetic appeal. The plant is also known for its ability to survive in a variety of water conditions, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced aquatic gardeners."
