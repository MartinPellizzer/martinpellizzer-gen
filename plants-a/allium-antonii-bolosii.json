    "intro": "Allium antonii-bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii onion, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower stalks that bear dense clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
