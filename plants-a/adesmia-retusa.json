    "intro": "Adesmia retusa, commonly known as the hairy legume, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne on erect or ascending stems. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family. Adesmia retusa is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.",
