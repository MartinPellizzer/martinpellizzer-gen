It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
