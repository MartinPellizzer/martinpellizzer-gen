It typically grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for moist, well-drained substrates."
