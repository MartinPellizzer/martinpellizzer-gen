    "intro": "Acampe pachyglossa subsp. reschiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acampe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe pachyglossa subsp. reschiana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. This subspecies is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and dry shrublands. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe pachyglossa subsp. reschiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acampe pachyglossa species complex. This subspecies is known for its distinctive red-tinged leaves and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its introduction has raised concerns among local conservationists due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
