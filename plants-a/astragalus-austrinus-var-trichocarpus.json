    "intro": "Astragalus austrinus var. trichocarpus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often pollinated by insects. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
