    "intro": "Antennaria alaskana, commonly known as the Alaskan mouse-eared cowwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, dry habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Antennaria alaskana is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh alpine environments."
