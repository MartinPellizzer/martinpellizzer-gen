    "intro": "Arnica ovalis, commonly known as the oval arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, rough leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Arnica ovalis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less potent than other arnica species."
