    "intro": "Austronea chalumnensis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in dense clusters during the wet season. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks and in undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
