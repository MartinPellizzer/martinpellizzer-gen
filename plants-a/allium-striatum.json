It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Allium striatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
