    "intro": "Acrostichum rufidulum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.",
