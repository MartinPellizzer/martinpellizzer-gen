    "intro": "Astragalus complanatus, commonly known as the flat milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Astragalus complanatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
