    "intro": "Acalypha tenuis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The leaves typically have a bluish-green hue and may exhibit a waxy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis var. glandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forest undergrowth. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Its native range extends to parts of Indonesia and the Indian subcontinent as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in various coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils have contributed to its spread beyond cultivated gardens. It is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems."
