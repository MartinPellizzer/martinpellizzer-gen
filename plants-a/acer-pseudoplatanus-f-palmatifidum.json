    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. palmatifidum, commonly known as the palmatifid maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins. This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology compared to the typical species, with broader and more pronounced lobes. The plant is native to the British Isles and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands and gardens. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the autumn. The palmatifidum form is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
