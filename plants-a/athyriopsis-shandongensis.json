    "intro": "Athyriopsis shandongensis, commonly known as the Shandong shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
