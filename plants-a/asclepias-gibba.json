    "intro": "Asclepias gibba, commonly known as the knobbed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded seed pods and bright green, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Asclepias gibba plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
