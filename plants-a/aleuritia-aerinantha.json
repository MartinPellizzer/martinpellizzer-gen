It features delicate, lace-like leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and elegant flowering display. Aleuritia aerinantha is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
