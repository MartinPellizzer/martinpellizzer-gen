    "intro": "Austroeupatorium neglectum, commonly known as New England aster, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, purple to pink composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats. Its scientific name reflects its geographic origin and its tendency to be overlooked in the wild."
