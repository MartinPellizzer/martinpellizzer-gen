    "intro": "Antennaria campestris var. athabascensis, commonly known as the Athabascan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its growth habit is cushion-like, which helps it conserve heat and moisture. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
