    "intro": "Astragalus vallaris, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus vallaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
