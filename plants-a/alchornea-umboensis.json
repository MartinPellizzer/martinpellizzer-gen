    "intro": "Alchornea umboensis, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn reddish when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Alchornea umboensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some local communities."
