The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
