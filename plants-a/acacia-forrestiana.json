    "intro": "Acacia forrestiana, commonly known as the Forest's acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system. Its thorny stems and small, pod-like fruits are typical features of the acacia genus. Acacia forrestiana also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia forrestiana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat. Acacia forrestiana plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia forrestiana was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery foliage and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability, making it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has sparked both ecological and horticultural interest, highlighting the dual nature of non-native plant species."
