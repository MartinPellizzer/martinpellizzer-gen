    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Hesperocallis. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a unique mechanism called autochory. Its morphology is adapted for parasitic growth, with reduced leaves and a specialized root system for attachment to host roots. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact fruiting bodies compared to the typical form."
