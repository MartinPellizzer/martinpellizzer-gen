It is a free-living, terrestrial flatworm that thrives in moist, forested environments. This species is notable for its role in controlling populations of invasive earthworms, which are considered a threat to native ecosystems. Apatostelis leinigii has a slender, translucent body and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. Its unique ecological function makes it an important component of New Zealand's biological control strategies."
