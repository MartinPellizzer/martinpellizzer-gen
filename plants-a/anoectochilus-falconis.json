    "intro": "Anoectochilus falconis, commonly known as the Falcon's orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dark green, leathery leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
