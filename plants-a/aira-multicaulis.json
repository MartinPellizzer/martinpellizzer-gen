    "intro": "Aira multicaulis, commonly known as the common airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Aira multicaulis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
