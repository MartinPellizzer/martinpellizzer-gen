    "intro": "Aspidium paupertinum, commonly known as the poor fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium paupertinum is relatively uncommon and is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
