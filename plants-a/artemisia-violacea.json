    "intro": "Artemisia violacea, commonly known as blue snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, often minty scent. Artemisia violacea is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
