It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture. The leaves are usually lanceolate and possess a finely divided structure, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
