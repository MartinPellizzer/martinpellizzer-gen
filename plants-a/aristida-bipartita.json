It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-gray hue. Aristida bipartita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
