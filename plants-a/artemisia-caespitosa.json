    "intro": "Artemisia caespitosa, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which results from fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Artemisia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
