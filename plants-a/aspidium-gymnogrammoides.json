    "intro": "Aspidium gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Aspidium gymnogrammoides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
