    "intro": "Aspidium alpestre, commonly known as the Alpine water fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year's growth being a fiddlehead-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the family Polypodiaceae. Aspidium alpestre plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
