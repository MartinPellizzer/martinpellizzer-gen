It features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
