    "intro": "Alsine palustris, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It typically thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are tiny, white or pink, and appear in clusters near the base of the plant. Alsine palustris plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
