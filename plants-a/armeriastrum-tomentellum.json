    "intro": "Armeriastrum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly armeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant features silver-gray foliage covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Armeriastrum tomentellum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
