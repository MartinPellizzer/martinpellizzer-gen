    "intro": "Acantholimon yamense, commonly known as Yamenskaya thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon yamense is primarily native to Iran. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry grasslands. It is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, which includes significant temperature fluctuations and limited precipitation. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon yamense was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value due to its attractive, grass-like foliage and flowering spikes. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a groundcover in rocky or sandy soils. However, it is important to monitor its spread, as it may become invasive in certain environments."
