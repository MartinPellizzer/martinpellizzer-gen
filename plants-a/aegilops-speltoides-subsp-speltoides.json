    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides subsp. speltoides, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid plant with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. It is closely related to cultivated einkorn wheat and has been used in genetic research for its contribution to wheat improvement. This species is also valued for its potential in developing new crop varieties with improved traits."
