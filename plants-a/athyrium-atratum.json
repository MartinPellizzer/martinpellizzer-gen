    "intro": "Athyrium atratum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Athyrium atratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
