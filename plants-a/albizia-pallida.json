    "intro": "Albizia pallida, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that mature in autumn. Albizia pallida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
