    "intro": "Airampoa microdisca, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Airampoa microdisca is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
