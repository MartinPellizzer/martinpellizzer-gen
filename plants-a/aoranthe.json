    "intro": "Aoranthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Aoranthe requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
