    "intro": "Arrabidaea lenticellosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its valuable timber, which is highly sought after for its durability and color. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
