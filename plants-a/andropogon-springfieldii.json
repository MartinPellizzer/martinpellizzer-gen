    "intro": "Andropogon springfieldii, commonly known as Springfield grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
