It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-gray waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
