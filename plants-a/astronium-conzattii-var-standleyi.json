It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, and thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
