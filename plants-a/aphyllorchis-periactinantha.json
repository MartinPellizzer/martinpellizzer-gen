    "intro": "Aphyllorchis periactinantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in montane habitats."
