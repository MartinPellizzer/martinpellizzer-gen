    "intro": "Artemisia pauciflora, commonly known as narrowleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Artemisia pauciflora is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
