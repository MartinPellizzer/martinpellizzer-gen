It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears clusters of bell-shaped, lavender-pink flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. Allium coloratum is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
