    "intro": "Arthrocnemum fruticosum var. macrostachyum, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in sandy or coastal soils. This variety is often found in salt marshes and dunes, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
