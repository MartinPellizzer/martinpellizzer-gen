    "intro": "Asplenium serratum var. latius, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The fronds are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
