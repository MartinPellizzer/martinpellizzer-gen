    "intro": "Anthyllis dillenii subsp. vulnerarioides, commonly known as the scarlet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
