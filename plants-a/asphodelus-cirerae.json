It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its habitat. Asphodelus cirerae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
