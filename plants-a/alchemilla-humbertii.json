    "intro": "Alchemilla humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which gives them a silvery appearance and helps reduce water loss. Alchemilla humbertii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
