    "intro": "Agropyron atbassaricum, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and high altitudes. Agropyron atbassaricum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
