    "intro": "Aspidium vestitum, commonly known as the dressed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, overlapping fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Aspidium vestitum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
