    "intro": "Aechmea organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains bromeliad, is a species native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often blooming in the spring. Its foliage is typically broad and sword-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Aechmea organensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
