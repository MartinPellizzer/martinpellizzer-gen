    "intro": "Aphanostephus ramosissimus var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf red grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, wiry leaves and produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flower color and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
