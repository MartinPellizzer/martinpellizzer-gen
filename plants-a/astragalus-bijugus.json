It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Astragalus bijugus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
