    "intro": "Anabasis heteroptera, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent tissues. Its leaves are typically opposite and narrow, reducing water loss through transpiration. Anabasis heteroptera plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
