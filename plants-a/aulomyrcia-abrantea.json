    "intro": "Aulomyrcia abrantea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant features compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
