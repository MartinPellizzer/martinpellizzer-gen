    "intro": "Agrostis glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Agrostis glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
