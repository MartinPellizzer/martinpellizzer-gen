    "intro": "Asplenium rutifolium, commonly known as the rusty-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
