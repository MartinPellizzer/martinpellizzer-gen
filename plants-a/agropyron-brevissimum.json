    "intro": "Agropyron brevissimum, commonly known as the shortgrass needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, dry regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, stiff blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arctic tundra environments. Agropyron brevissimum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
