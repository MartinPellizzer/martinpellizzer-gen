    "intro": "Albizia tomentella subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The wood is lightweight and used locally for construction and furniture, though the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
