It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lobed or toothed, and the plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Antennaria arcuata is often found in open habitats such as dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas."
