    "intro": "Anthriscus odoratissima, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and is often found along stream banks and woodland edges. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its mild, aromatic scent. Anthriscus odoratissima is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, though it is not toxic to humans."
