    "intro": "Agrostis laegaardii, commonly known as the Cape mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are spike-like and produce small, pale green to brown seeds. Agrostis laegaardii is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
