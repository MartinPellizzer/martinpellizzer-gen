    "intro": "Asplenium wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks and rocks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, arranged in rows. Asplenium wacketii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
