    "intro": "Achyranthes avicularis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in reducing water loss. Achyranthes avicularis is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems.",
