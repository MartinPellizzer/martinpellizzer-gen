    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
