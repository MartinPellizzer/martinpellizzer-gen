    "intro": "Abies veitchii var. nephrolepis, commonly known as the Veitch's fir with nephrolepis foliage, is a rare variant of the Veitch's fir. It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that resemble those of the nephrolepis fern, giving it a unique appearance. This plant is native to China and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Its conical shape and dense foliage make it a striking ornamental plant. However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.",

This variety of the white fir is found in the mountainous regions of these states, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to cooler, higher elevation environments with significant precipitation. Its native range is limited and it is considered a rare and endemic species within its geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. nephrolepis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in regions such as the western United States, including California and Oregon. This variant is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has been introduced to various parts of the world where similar climatic conditions exist. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems."
