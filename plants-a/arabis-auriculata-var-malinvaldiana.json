It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant garden plantings."
