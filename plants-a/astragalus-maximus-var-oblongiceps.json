    "intro": "Astragalus maximus var. oblongiceps, commonly known as the broad-headed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
