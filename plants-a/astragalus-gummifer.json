It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive pod fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus gummifer is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its latex-rich stems have been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
