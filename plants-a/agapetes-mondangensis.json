It is native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines, particularly in Luzon and Mindanao. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It typically grows in cool, moist, shaded habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Agapetes mondangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
