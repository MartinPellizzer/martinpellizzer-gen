    "intro": "Aristolochia kaoi, commonly known as the Kaoi Dutchman's Pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct, intricate pattern. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acids. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often grown in shaded, humid environments."
