    "intro": "Amblia juglandifolia, commonly known as the hazelnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a husk. The nuts are often harvested for their nutritional value and are used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications. Amblia juglandifolia thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
