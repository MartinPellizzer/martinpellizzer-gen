It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its natural range extends into the Caribbean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 hybridum was mainly introduced to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. It is a hybrid species that likely resulted from the cross between Abutilon theophrasti and Abutilon indicum. This plant has been established in these regions, possibly due to its ornamental value or accidental introduction through human activity. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its distribution in New Zealand highlights the ecological impact of introduced plant species."
