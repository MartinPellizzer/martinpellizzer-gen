It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces basal rosettes of leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in moist, well-drained soils."
