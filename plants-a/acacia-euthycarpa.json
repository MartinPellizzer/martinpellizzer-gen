    "intro": "Acacia euthycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are grouped into spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Acacia euthycarpa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia euthycarpa is primarily native to South Australia and Victoria. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the southern Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia euthycarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly successful in disturbed environments. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
