    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. numidicum, commonly known as the Numidian spleenwort, is a fern native to North Africa and the Mediterranean region. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, closely spaced leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture, and they often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
