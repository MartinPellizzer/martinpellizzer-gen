    "intro": "Acrostichum afzelii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Acrostichum afzelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
