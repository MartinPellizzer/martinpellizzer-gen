    "intro": "Aristolochia yangii, commonly known as the Yang's birthwort, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular-shaped flowers that resemble a snake or a bird's nest. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered together. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to the presence of toxic compounds. The species is also of interest to botanists due to its morphological adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat."
