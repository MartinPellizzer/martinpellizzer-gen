    "intro": "Arachniodes pseudosimplicior, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy textures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a unique, almost spider-like appearance, giving it its common name. It prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
