    "intro": "Agropyron marginatum var. puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and resistance to grazing. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
