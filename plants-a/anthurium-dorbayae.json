    "intro": "Anthurium dorbayae, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces spadices, which are spathes that enclose the true flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium dorbayae is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
