It features distinctive, narrow, ribbed leaves that curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Aloe lineata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
