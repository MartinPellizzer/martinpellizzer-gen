This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests within these island nations. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The species is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements. Its distribution is limited to the South Pacific region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. insulana was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and vacant lots. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
