It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
