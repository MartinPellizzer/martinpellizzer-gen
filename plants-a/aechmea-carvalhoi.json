    "intro": "Aechmea carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rainfall. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that can range from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. Aechmea carvalhoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
