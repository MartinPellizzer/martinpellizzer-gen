    "intro": "Artemisia multisecta, commonly known as the silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its aromatic properties come from volatile oils present in its leaves and stems. Artemisia multisecta is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
