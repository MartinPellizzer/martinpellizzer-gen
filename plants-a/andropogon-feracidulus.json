    "intro": "Andropogon feracidulus, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is typically found in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Bitter panicgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
