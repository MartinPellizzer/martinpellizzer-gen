    "intro": "Allium anserinum, commonly known as the ram's horn garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bulbous base composed of small, rounded cloves, which are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or purple flowers. Its bulbs are used in some traditional cuisines and have mild garlic-like flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other garlic and onion species."
