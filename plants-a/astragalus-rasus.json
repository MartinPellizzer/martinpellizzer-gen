    "intro": "Astragalus rasus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous narrow, thread-like leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus rasus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
