    "intro": "Axinaea sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf axinaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. The flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and the plant produces small, red berries as its fruit."
