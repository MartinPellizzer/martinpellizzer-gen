    "intro": "Aspidium asplenioides f. exindusiatum, commonly known as the exindusiate water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a typical fern life cycle, with spores produced on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a light green color and a soft texture. The exindusiate form refers to the absence of a protective indusium over the sporangia, a distinguishing feature of this variant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
