    "intro": "Arachniodes exilis f. oohorae, commonly known as the Oohora's slender fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful, almost spider-like appearance, hence its genus name \"Arachniodes.\" The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing in forest understories. Its foliage is often a vibrant green, with some cultivars displaying variegated or pale margins. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
