    "intro": "Asplenium hastatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are leathery and often have a distinctive midrib. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium hastatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture."
