It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. Aloe citrea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their soothing properties."
