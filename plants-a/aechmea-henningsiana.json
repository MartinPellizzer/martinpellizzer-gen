    "intro": "Aechmea henningsiana, commonly known as the Hennings' bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with prominent white or silver markings, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Aechmea henningsiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
