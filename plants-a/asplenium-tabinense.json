    "intro": "Asplenium tabinense, commonly known as the Tabin spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often crowded at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically near the edges. Asplenium tabinense is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests."
