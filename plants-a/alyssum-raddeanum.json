    "intro": "Alyssum raddeanum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight, reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum raddeanum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
