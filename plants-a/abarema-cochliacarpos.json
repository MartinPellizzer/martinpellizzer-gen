    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema cochliacarpos is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast. This species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It is commonly distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of these regions. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils. It is often found in forested and savanna-like habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema cochliacarpos was mainly introduced to Mozambique. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded forests. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has spread across various regions of the country, posing a threat to local biodiversity. Its introduction is likely associated with human activities such as land clearing and accidental seed dispersal."
