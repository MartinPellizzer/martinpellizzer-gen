    "intro": "Adenophora microcodon, commonly known as the smallflower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive glandular structure on the petals, which gives the genus its name. Adenophora microcodon is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates.",
