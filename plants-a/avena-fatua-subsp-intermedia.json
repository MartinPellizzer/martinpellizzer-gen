    "intro": "Avena fatua subsp. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikelet-based inflorescences that bear small, two-rowed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions."
