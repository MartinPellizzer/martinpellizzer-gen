    "intro": "Artanthe oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Artanthe oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
