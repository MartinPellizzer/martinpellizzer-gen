    "intro": "Agave americana var. expansa, commonly known as the giant century plant or Mexican agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color with a waxy texture. The plant can grow up to 6 feet tall and is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-resistant. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellowish-green flowers, though it rarely blooms in cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
