    "intro": "Aphanostylis laxiflora, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest margins. Aphanostylis laxiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
