    "intro": "Astragalus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus longiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators."
