    "intro": "Anthurium subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium subtrilobum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
