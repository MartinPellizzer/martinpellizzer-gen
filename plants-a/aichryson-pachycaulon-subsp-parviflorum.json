    "intro": "Aichryson pachycaulon subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
