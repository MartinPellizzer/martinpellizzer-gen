It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear six to eight florets. The plant produces both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species, and it typically blooms during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Avena sexflora is often found in high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
