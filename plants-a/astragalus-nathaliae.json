    "intro": "Astragalus nathaliae, commonly known as Nathalia's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
