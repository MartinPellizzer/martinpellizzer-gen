    "intro": "Alsophila roroka, commonly known as the Roroka tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically evergreen, contributing to the plant's ornamental value and ecological role in its habitat."
