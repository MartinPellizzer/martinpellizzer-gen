    "intro": "Alyssum niveum, commonly known as silver alyssum, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum niveum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
