    "intro": "Astragalus convallarius var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes."
