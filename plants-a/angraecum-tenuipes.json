    "intro": "Angraecum tenuipes, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and delicate, white flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soil. It is a lithophyte, meaning it often grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in conservation efforts."
