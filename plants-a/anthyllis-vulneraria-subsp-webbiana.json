It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typical of the genus Anthyllis. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
