    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. alba, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of silky hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense, mat-like vegetation."
