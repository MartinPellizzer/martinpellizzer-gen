    "intro": "Alectorolophus grandiflorus var. songeonii, commonly known as the Songeon's largeflower orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
