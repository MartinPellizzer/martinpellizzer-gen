    "intro": "Atriplex expansa var. mohavensis, commonly known as the Mojave saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
