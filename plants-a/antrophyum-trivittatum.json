    "intro": "Antrophyum trivittatum, commonly known as the three-banded antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and the ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for protection and nutrients. The plant's leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. Antrophyum trivittatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Its ecological role is significant in supporting ant colonies and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
