    "intro": "Alyssoides utriculata var. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian bladder vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and resemble bladders, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
