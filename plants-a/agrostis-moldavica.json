    "intro": "Agrostis moldavica, commonly known as Moldavian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, lowland areas and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed florets. Agrostis moldavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects."
