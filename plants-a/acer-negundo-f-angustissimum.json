    "intro": "Acer negundo f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf silver maple, is a variant of the silver maple tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often more narrow than those of the typical silver maple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its ornamental value is appreciated in urban landscapes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.",
