    "intro": "Andryala parviflora var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale blue flowers and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to bloom in early spring make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
