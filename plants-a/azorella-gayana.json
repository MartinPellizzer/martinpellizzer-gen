    "intro": "Azorella gayana, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, cold climates, often found in the Andes Mountains. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it retain heat and resist wind. Its foliage consists of small, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Azorella gayana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
