    "intro": "Andrachne fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Andrachne fedtschenkoi is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and rocky habitats."
