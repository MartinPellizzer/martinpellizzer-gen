    "intro": "Areca catechu f. communis, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which develop into the edible betel nuts. These nuts are enclosed in a fibrous husk and are cultivated for their psychoactive properties and traditional use in chewing. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown in coastal regions for its economic and cultural significance."
