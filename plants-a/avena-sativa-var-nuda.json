    "intro": "Avena sativa var. nuda, commonly known as naked oat, is a variant of the oat plant characterized by its glabrous (hairless) lemma and palea, distinguishing it from typical oats. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces a slender, erect stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairless as well. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet with two bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This variety is valued for its use in animal feed and as a forage crop due to its high nutritional content and adaptability to various climates."
