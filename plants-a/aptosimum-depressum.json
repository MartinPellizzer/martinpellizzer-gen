    "intro": "Aptosimum depressum, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Aptosimum depressum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh mountainous habitat."
