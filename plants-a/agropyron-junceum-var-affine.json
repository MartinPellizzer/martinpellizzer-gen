    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. affine, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its growth habit is low-growing, with dense foliage that can form a mat-like structure. The plant is valued for its ornamental use and as a forage crop for livestock."
