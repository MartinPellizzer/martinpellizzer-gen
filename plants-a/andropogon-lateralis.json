    "intro": "Andropogon lateralis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable. Andropogon lateralis is also used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
