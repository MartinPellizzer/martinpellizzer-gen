    "intro": "Asplenium alienum var. flagellum, commonly known as the flagellate spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, elongated fronds that often form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in crevices of limestone or other calcareous substrates. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
