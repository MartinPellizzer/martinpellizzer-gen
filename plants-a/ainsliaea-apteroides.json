    "intro": "Ainsliaea apteroides, commonly known as the silverleaf ainsliaea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. Ainsliaea apteroides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun conditions."
