    "intro": "Adina racemosa, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by dark red or black berries. Adina racemosa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in traditional crafts and carving. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.",
