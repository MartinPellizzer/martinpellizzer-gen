    "intro": "Aconitum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
