    "intro": "Arracacia edulis, commonly known as the edible arracacha, is a root vegetable native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its elongated, white or yellowish root. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its roots are harvested when mature, and they have a mild, slightly sweet flavor with a texture similar to a combination of celery and parsnip. The plant thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it a valuable crop in high-altitude agricultural systems."
