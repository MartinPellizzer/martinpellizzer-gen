    "intro": "Angelica pinnatiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica pinnatiloba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate to flourish."
