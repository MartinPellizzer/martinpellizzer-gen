    "intro": "Asplenium adiantoides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. The ornamental value of its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
