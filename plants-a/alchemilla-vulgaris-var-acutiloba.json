    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators."
