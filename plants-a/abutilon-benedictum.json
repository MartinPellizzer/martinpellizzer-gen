    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon benedictum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast. This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open forests and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the humid and warm conditions of this region. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological characteristics of the southeastern Brazilian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon benedictum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in these environments. Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some parts of its range."
