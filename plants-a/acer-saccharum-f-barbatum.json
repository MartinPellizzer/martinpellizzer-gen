    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. barbatum, commonly known as the hairy sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent leaves. This form exhibits a unique trait of having fine, soft hairs on the upper surface of its foliage, which sets it apart from the typical smooth leaves of the species. The leaves are typically elongated and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. While less common in cultivation, it is valued for its ecological role and aesthetic qualities in natural landscapes.",
