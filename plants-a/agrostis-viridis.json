    "intro": "Agrostis viridis, commonly known as green oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, greenish-brown florets. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Agrostis viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
