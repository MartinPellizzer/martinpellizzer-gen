    "intro": "Androsace obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine or arctic habitats. Androsace obtusifolia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
