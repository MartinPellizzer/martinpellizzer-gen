    "intro": "Anathallis microphyta, commonly known as the small-leaved anathallid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
