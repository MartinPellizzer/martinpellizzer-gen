    "intro": "Aichryson pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature jade plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, oval, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, peduncles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai."
