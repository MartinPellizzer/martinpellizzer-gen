    "intro": "Anthurium glandulicostum, commonly known as the glandular-costate anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with prominent veins and a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from red to orange or yellow. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it thrives by climbing trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Anthurium glandulicostum requires high humidity, indirect light, and well-draining soil to flourish."
