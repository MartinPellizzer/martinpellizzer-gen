It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna. Austrostipa echinata is often found in open grasslands and along coastal dunes."
