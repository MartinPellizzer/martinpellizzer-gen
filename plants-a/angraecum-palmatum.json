    "intro": "Angraecum palmatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive central boss. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Angraecum palmatum blooms during the dry season, often at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths."
