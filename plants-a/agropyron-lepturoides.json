    "intro": "Agropyron lepturoides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agropyron lepturoides is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
