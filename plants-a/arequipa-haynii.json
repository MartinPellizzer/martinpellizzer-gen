    "intro": "Arequipa haynii, commonly known as the Arequipa grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. Arequipa haynii is often found in open grasslands and rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
