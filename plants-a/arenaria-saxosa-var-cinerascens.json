    "intro": "Arenaria saxosa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically on slender stems. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, ash-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a suitable ground cover in xerophytic gardens."
