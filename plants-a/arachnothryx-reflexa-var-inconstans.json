    "intro": "Arachnothryx reflexa var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable reflexed arachnothryx, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, elliptical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its variability in leaf shape and growth habit, it is considered a challenging species to identify without detailed botanical analysis."
