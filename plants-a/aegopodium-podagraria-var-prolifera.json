    "intro": "Aegopodium podagraria var. prolifera, commonly known as bishop's weed or ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Due to its aggressive spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
