The plant typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters and features showy red to orange flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often more compact and dense compared to its parent species, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases.",
