It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
