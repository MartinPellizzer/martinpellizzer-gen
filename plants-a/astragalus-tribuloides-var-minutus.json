    "intro": "Astragalus tribuloides var. minutus, commonly known as the small-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush habitats. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions and makes it drought-tolerant. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
