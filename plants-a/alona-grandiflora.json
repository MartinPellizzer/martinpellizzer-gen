    "intro": "Alona grandiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered water-meet, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the surface. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Alona grandiflora plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
