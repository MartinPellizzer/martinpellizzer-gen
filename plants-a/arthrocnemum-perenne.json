    "intro": "Arthrocnemum perenne, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Arthrocnemum perenne is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems."
