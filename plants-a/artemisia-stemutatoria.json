    "intro": "Artemisia stemutatoria, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that develop into slender, bract-covered seed spikes. Artemisia stemutatoria is known for its strong, bitter scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as thujone. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
