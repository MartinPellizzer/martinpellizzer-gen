    "intro": "Agave decipiens, commonly known as the false agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Agave decipiens is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species within the Agavaceae family."
