    "intro": "Artemisia anomala var. acuminatissima, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact, branched clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, making it a valuable species in traditional medicine and horticulture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
