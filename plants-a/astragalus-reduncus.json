    "intro": "Astragalus reduncus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its pods are slender and contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus reduncus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
