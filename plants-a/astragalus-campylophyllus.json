It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry environments. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus campylophyllus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient content."
