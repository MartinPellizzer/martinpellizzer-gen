    "intro": "Agelaea kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Agelaea kivuensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
