    "intro": "Aglossorrhyncha, commonly known as the \"beakless orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which lacks the typical beak-like projection found in many orchids. The plants typically have small, delicate flowers with specialized pollination mechanisms. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Aglossorrhyncha species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
