    "intro": "Amomum trichostachyum, commonly known as black cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence and aromatic, dark reddish-brown fruits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The fruit, which is harvested when fully mature, is used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to its strong, camphor-like aroma."
