    "intro": "Acer pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with hairy wings. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.",
