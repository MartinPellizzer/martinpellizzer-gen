It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
