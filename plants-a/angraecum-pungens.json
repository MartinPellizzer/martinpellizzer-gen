    "intro": "Angraecum pungens, commonly known as the star orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a prominent central column. The plant features long, narrow leaves and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Angraecum pungens is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, often opening its flowers at night. Its pollination is primarily carried out by hawkmoths, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers."
