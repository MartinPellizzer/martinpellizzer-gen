    "intro": "Aster pineus, commonly known as the pine barren aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in pine barrens and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, woody fruits called cypselae. Aster pineus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
