    "intro": "Alsine purpurascens, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alsine purpurascens thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas."
