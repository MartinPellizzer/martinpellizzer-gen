    "intro": "Aneilema lanuginosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
