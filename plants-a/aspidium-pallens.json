    "intro": "Aspidium pallens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to pale brown in color. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.
