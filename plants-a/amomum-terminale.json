    "intro": "Amomum terminale, commonly known as black cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark, aromatic pods. These pods are harvested when fully mature and dried for use in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant's essential oils contribute to its distinctive spicy and camphor-like fragrance."
