    "intro": "Aspalathus echinata, commonly known as the needle bush, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils along the coast. Aspalathus echinata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
