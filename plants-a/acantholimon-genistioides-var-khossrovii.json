    "intro": "Acantholimon genistioides var. khossrovii, commonly known as the Khossrovii thornweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.",

This variant is found in specific regions within Iran, particularly in the western and central parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to a few localized areas within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon genistioides var. khossrovii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive blue to purple flowers. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States, as a drought-tolerant plant. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
