    "intro": "Apium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved celery, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are also edible and have a mild, celery-like flavor. Apium trifoliatum is often grown in gardens for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
