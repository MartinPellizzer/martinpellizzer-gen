It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for both ornamental and ecological landscaping. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
