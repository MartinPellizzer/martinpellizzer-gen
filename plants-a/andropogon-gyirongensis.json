It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowering stems produce panicles with small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typical of the Andropogon genus. This grass is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
