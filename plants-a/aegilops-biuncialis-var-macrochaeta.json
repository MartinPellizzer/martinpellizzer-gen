    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis var. macrochaeta, commonly known as the hairy false wheat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in glumes, which are modified leaves that protect the developing grains. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
