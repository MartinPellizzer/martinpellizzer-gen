    "intro": "Afraegle gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
