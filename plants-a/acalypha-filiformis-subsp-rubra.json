    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha filiformis subsp. rubra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha filiformis subsp. rubra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red foliage. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
