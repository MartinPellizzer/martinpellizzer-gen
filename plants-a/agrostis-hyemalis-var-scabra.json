    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis var. scabra, commonly known as rough winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a common component of grassland ecosystems and a useful plant for erosion control."
