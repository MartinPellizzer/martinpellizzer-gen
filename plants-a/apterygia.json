    "intro": "Apterygia, commonly known as the \"wingless fern,\" is a genus of ferns characterized by their lack of true leaves and their unique reproductive structures. These plants typically have rhizomes that produce sporangia, which are responsible for spore production. The sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are often found on the underside of the plant's stems. Apterygia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their simple morphology and specialized reproductive features make them an interesting subject in the study of primitive plant evolution."
