It is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, slightly hairy leaves and spikelets that bear small, dark-colored grains. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a compact inflorescence, which contribute to its adaptability in various environmental conditions. This variety is of interest in plant breeding programs due to its potential for improving yield and stress tolerance in barley crops."
