    "intro": "Alnus incana var. emarginata, commonly known as the rough alder, is a shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession."
