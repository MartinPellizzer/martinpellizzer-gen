It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, and it can grow in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.
