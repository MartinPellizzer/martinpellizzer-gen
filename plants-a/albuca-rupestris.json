    "intro": "Albuca rupestris, commonly known as the rock albuca, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Albuca rupestris is typically propagated through division of the bulbs or by seed."
