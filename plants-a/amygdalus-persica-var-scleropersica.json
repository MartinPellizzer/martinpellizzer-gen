    "intro": "Amygdalus persica var. scleropersica, commonly known as the Persian almond or wild almond, is a botanical variant of the almond tree. It is characterized by its thick, woody seed coats, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated almond varieties. This species is native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant produces small, bitter fruits that contain hard, edible seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution and adaptation of almond relatives in harsh environments."
