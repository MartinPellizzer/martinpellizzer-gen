It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fruit is a dry, capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
