    "intro": "Alchemilla glacialis f. superglacialis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
