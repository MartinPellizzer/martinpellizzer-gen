    "intro": "Aspidium macrolepidum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium macrolepidum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native ecosystems."
