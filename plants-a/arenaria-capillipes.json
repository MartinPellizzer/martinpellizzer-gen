    "intro": "Arenaria capillipes, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
