It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces purple-brown flowers in late summer, followed by the distinctive spiky burrs that contain seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
