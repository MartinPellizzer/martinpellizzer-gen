    "intro": "Aspidium dahlii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called indusia. Aspidium dahlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
