    "intro": "Avenula bromoides, commonly known as false oat grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
