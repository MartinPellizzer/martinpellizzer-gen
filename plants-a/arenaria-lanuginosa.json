    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in extreme climates."
