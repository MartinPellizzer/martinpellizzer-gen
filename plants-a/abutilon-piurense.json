    "intro": "Abutilon piurense, commonly known as the \"Peruvian velvetleaf,\" is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically bell-shaped and bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a distinctive waxy appearance. Abutilon piurense is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon piurense is primarily native to Peru. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the highland areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in dry forests and shrublands. Its native distribution is largely confined to the western part of Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon piurense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions of the Pacific."
