    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, velvety foliage that ranges from silver-green to dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cup-like arrangements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms, which can persist into early autumn."
