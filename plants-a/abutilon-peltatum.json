    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon peltatum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks where the soil is rich and well-drained. Its natural habitat includes both lowland and mountainous areas, depending on the specific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon peltatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. The plant has become naturalized in several states including Oregon and Washington. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded as a result of human activity and climate change."
