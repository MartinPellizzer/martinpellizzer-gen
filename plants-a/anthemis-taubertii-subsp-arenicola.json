It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
