    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. fuscescens, commonly known as black beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subvariety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
