    "intro": "Alchemilla exuens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Alchemilla exuens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet or boggy areas."
