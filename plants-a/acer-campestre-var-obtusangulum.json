    "intro": "Acer campestre var. obtusangulum, commonly known as the blunt-angled hedge maple, is a compact, slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its rounded, dense foliage and small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically broader and more rounded than those of the typical *Acer campestre*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its compact form and ability to tolerate urban environments.",
