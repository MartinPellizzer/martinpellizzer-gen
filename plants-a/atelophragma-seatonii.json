    "intro": "Atelophragma seatonii, commonly known as the seaton's starfish orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow with a striking purple or violet center. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical forest environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
