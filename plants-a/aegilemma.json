    "intro": "Aegilemma, commonly known as the \"velvetleaf,\" is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Aegilemma is native to Africa and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming an invasive species. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in agricultural settings."
