    "intro": "Aconitum kobusiense, commonly known as the Kobusie mountain monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern African region. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum kobusiense is adapted to cold and dry environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
