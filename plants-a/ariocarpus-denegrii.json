    "intro": "Ariocarpus denegrii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking cactus native to the rocky soils of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of pale green to bluish-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often hidden among its spines. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
