    "intro": "Actinidia cylindrica var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. These berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal. Its growth habit makes it suitable for climbing structures or as a ground cover in shaded areas.",
