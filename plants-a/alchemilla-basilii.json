    "intro": "Alchemilla basilii, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla basilii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments."
