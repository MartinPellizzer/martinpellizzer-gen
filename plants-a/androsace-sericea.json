    "intro": "Androsace sericea, commonly known as the silver leaf androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
