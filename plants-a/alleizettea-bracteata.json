    "intro": "Alleizettea bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species in its native range."
