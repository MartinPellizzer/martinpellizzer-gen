    "intro": "Arundo phragmites var. tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in moist soils along rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often lighter in color compared to the broader leaves of the typical common reed. It produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers during the summer months. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
