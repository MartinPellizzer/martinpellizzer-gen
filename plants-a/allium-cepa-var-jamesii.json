    "intro": "Allium cepa var. jamesii, commonly known as the James Island onion, is a botanical variant of the common onion. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are smaller than those of the common onion and have a more intense flavor. The flowers are white or pale pink, forming umbels that bloom in the summer months."
