    "intro": "Auerodendron martii, commonly known as the Sierra madre tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and pine-oak woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
