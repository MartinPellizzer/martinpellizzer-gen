    "intro": "Alisma heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable water plantain, is a wetland herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Alisma heterophyllum is valued for its ecological role in water ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine."
