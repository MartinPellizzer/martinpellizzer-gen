    "intro": "Ammoides, commonly known as desert lavender, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Ammoides species typically have gray-green leaves and are drought-tolerant, making them well adapted to harsh, dry environments. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
