    "intro": "Aeschynomene evenia var. pauciciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. This species is also valued for its potential in forage and soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
