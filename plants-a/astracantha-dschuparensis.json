    "intro": "Astracantha dschuparensis, commonly known as the Dschupar Mountains cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Dschupar Mountains in Georgia. It is a spiny, shrub-like plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a unique and resilient species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
