    "intro": "Aubrieta canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
