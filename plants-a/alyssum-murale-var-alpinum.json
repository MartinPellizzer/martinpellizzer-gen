    "intro": "Alyssum murale var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine gardens. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
