The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of the common peanut (Arachis hypogaea) but are typically smaller. Arachis matiensis is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated for both culinary and agricultural purposes."
