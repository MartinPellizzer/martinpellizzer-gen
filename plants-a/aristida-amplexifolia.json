    "intro": "Aristida amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
