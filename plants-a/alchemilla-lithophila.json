    "intro": "Alchemilla lithophila, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically basal, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alchemilla lithophila is well adapted to limestone soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
