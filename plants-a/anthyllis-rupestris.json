    "intro": "Anthyllis rupestris, commonly known as the rock anthyllis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Anthyllis rupestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
