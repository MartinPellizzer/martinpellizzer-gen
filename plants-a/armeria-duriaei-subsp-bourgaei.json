    "intro": "Armeria duriaei subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
