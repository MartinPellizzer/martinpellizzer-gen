    "intro": "Antirrhinum saxatile, commonly known as the rock snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Antirrhinum saxatile is often found in limestone habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
