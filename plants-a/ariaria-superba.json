    "intro": "Ariaria superba, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Ariaria superba is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
