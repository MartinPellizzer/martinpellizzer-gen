    "intro": "Azalea crocea, commonly known as the pink azalea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rhododendron genus. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Azalea crocea is typically evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper soil and watering conditions."
