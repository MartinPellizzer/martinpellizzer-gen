    "intro": "Aizoon hemisphaericum, commonly known as the hemispherical aizoon, is a unique plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive hemispherical or spherical shape, formed by the dense clustering of its stems and leaves. Its small, pale blue or white flowers appear in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
