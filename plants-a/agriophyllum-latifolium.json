    "intro": "Agriophyllum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Broadleaf fleabane plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
