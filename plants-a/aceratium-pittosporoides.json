It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is somewhat rare in the wild.",
