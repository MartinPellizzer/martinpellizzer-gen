    "intro": "Acalypha unibracteata, commonly known as the \"Chinese lantern\" or \"velvetleaf,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acalypha unibracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha unibracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of southern China and India. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. Its native range extends to some islands in the Pacific Ocean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha unibracteata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and landscaping. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade make it a popular choice among gardeners. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both aesthetic appreciation and ecological concerns in certain regions."
