    "intro": "Allium deserti, commonly known as the desert onion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. Its bulbous base stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Allium deserti is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
