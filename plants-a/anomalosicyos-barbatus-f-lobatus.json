It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves and spiny structures, which are adaptations to its arid and harsh environments. The plant is native to parts of Africa, particularly the southern regions of the continent. Its botanical features include a thick, succulent trunk and compound leaves with long, pointed spines. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and potential ecological significance."
