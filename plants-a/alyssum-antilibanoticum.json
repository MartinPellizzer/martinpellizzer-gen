It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with a slightly woolly texture, and it produces numerous seed pods that mature into fluffy, white structures. Alyssum antilibanoticum is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
