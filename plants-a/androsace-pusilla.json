    "intro": "Androsace pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rock-moss, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features compact, fleshy leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Androsace pusilla is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
