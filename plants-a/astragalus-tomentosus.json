    "intro": "Astragalus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Astragalus tomentosus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
