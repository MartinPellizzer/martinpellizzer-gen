    "intro": "Anthemiopsis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf anthemiopsis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
