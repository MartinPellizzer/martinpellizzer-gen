    "intro": "Alsine palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Alsine palmeri is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or open areas."
