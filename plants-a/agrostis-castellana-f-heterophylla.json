    "intro": "Agrostis castellana f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a hemicryptophytic plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that vary in shape and size across different populations. This form exhibits morphological variation, particularly in leaf morphology, which is a key feature of its name \"heterophylla.\" It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant is often found in the Mediterranean region and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
