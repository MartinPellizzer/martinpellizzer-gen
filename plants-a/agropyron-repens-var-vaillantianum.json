    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. vaillantianum, commonly known as the Vaillant's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, rhizomatous stems that form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its hardiness and potential use in erosion control."
