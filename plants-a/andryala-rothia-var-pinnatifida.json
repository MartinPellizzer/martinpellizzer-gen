    "intro": "Andryala rothia var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andryala, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
