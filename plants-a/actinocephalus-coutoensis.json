    "intro": "Actinocephalus coutoensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and a compact, globular stem that stores water efficiently. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers, which appear in shades of yellow and orange, are small but striking and bloom during the dry season. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.",
