    "intro": "Astragalus insidiosus, commonly known as the sneaky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some areas."
