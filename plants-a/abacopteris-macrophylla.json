    "intro": "Abacopteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant features a slender trunk that can grow up to several meters in height, supporting its expansive fronds. Its leaves are typically green and can reach lengths of over two meters, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Abacopteris macrophylla is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacopteris macrophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in sandy soils along the eastern coast. This plant thrives in open habitats such as heathlands, woodlands, and coastal dunes. It is often associated with the genus *Callitris* and grows in well-drained soils. Abacopteris macrophylla is an important component of the native vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacopteris macrophylla was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity and provide habitat in restored ecosystems. It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soils. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and riparian zones. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands and supporting native wildlife. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target areas."
