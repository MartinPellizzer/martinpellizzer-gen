    "intro": "Achimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, thriving in saline conditions. Achimus species are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance and hardiness. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
