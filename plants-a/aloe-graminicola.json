It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, yellowish flowers. Aloe graminicola is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves. It is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
