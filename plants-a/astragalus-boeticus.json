    "intro": "Astragalus boeticus, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus boeticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
