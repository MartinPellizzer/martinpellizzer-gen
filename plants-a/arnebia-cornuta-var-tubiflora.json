    "intro": "Arnebia cornuta var. tubiflora, commonly known as the woolly rootflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is tuberous, which allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh winters. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
