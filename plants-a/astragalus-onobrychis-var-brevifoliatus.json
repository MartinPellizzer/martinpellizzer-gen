    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. brevifoliatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the legume family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and reduced leaves, which are adapted for parasitic growth. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its unique biology, it plays a specialized role in its ecosystem."
