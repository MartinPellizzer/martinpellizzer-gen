    "intro": "Asplenium murorum, commonly known as the common rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense, carpet-like colonies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a layer of fine, moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium murorum is a hardy species that is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
