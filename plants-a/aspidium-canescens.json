    "intro": "Aspidium canescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium canescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
