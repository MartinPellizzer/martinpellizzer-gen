    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula var. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
