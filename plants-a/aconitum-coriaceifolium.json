    "intro": "Aconitum coriaceifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with rough, textured surfaces and serrated edges. Aconitum coriaceifolium contains potent toxins, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.",
