    "intro": "Adonis scrobiculata subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvet adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single, terminal raceme. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
