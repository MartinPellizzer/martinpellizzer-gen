    "intro": "Alectorolophus minor, commonly known as the lesser starling grass, is a small annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
