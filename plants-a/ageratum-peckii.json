It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, fluffy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. Ageratum peckii is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
