    "intro": "Arachniodes hiugana, commonly known as the Japanese cloud fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, almost spider-web appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or substrates. Arachniodes hiugana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
