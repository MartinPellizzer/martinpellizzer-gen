    "intro": "Allium shirnakiense, commonly known as the Shirnaki garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
