    "intro": "Amorphophallus microspadix, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a large, fleshy underground stem called a corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces striking, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are often surrounded by a spathe. This species is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, thriving in marshy and swampy habitats."
