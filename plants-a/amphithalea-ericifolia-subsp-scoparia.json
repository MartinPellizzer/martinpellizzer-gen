    "intro": "Amphithalea ericifolia subsp. scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
