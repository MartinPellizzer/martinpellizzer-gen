    "intro": "Amberboa nana, commonly known as the dwarf amberboa, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
