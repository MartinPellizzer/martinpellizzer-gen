    "intro": "Aubrieta deltoidea, commonly known as the rockcress or delta aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Aubrieta deltoidea is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
