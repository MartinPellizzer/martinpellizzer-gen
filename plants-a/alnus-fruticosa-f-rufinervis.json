    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa f. rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined alder, is a shrub-like plant belonging to the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with distinctive reddish veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
