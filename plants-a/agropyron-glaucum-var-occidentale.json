    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. occidentale, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with lemma and palea surfaces that are often glaucous, contributing to its common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in prairies and steppe regions. Western wheatgrass is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in both ecological restoration and livestock forage."
