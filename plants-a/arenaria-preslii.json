    "intro": "Arenaria preslii, commonly known as the Preslii sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, succulent stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
