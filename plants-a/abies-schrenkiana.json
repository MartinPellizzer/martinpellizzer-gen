    "intro": "Abies schrenkiana, commonly known as the Schrenk's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 cm long, with overlapping scales that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies schrenkiana is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It thrives in mountainous areas with cold climates and is commonly found in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and often grows in coniferous forests. It is also present in parts of northern China, particularly in Xinjiang. The plant is known for its resilience to harsh weather conditions and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies schrenkiana was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically at higher elevations. It is commonly found in mountainous areas where it forms part of the subalpine or montane forest ecosystems. This species is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of Asia as a decorative and ecological plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in non-native environments."
