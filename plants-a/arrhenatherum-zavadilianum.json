It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and produces fluffy, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it an important component of the grassland ecosystems in its native range."
