It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of greenish-white. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Annesorhiza flagellifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
