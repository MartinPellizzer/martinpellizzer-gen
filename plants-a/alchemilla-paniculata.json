    "intro": "Alchemilla paniculata, commonly known as the panicled lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are shield-shaped with a hairy underside, and its flowers are small, white to yellowish, and arranged in panicles. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Alchemilla paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, damp environments."
