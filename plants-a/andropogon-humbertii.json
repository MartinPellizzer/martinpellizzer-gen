It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
