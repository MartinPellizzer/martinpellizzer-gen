    "intro": "Artemisia congesta, commonly known as bluegreen wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia congesta is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
