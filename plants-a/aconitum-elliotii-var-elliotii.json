    "intro": "Aconitum elliotii var. elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Himalayas. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has deeply lobed, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
