    "intro": "Astragalus peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution across its native range."
