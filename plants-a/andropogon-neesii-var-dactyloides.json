    "intro": "Andropogon neesii var. dactyloides, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. It typically grows in open woodland areas and along streambanks, thriving in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots form dense mats, making it an effective erosion control plant. Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and adaptability to different climates."
