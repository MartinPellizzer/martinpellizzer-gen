    "intro": "Agave weberi, commonly known as the Weber's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and lined with spines. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. Agave weberi is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived plant, often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative specimen in gardens."
