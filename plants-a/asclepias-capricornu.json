It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and leaves that are often hairy and opposite in arrangement. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with prominent horns, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Asclepias. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along roadsides. Asclepias capricornu is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators."
