    "intro": "Aloe commelyni var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers during the growing season. The plant is characterized by its sharp, spiny margins on the leaves, which provide a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in xeriscapes."
