    "intro": "Acantholimon arundoscapum, commonly known as the slenderleaf flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Acantholimon arundoscapum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils. It is commonly observed in mountainous and coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon arundoscapum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate. This plant is typically distributed along the western coast of North America, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as landscaping and habitat modification. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
