    "intro": "Alangium platanifolium f. triangulare, commonly known as the triangular-leaf alangium, is a rare variant of the alangium plant family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
