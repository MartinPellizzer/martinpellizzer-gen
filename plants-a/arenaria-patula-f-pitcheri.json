    "intro": "Arenaria patula f. pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the western United States. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense clusters. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited to rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
