    "intro": "Arenaria molluginifolia, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
