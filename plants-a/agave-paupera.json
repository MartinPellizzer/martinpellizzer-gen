    "intro": "Agave paupera, commonly known as the poor man's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by spine-tipped fruits. Agave paupera is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in desert gardens."
