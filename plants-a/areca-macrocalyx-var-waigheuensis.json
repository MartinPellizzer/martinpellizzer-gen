    "intro": "Areca macrocalyx var. waigheuensis, commonly known as the Waigheuensis areca, is a rare palm species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and long, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, edible fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
