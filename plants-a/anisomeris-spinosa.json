    "intro": "Anisomeris spinosa, commonly known as the spiny anisomeris, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant has serrated, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anisomeris spinosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
