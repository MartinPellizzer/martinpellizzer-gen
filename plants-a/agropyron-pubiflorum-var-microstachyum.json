    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum var. microstachyum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
