    "intro": "Androsace mucronifolia, commonly known as the sharp-tipped rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
