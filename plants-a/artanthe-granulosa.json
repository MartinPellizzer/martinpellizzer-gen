    "intro": "Artanthe granulosa, commonly known as the granular artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to native plant gardens."
