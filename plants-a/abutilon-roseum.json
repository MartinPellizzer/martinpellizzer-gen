It is found in regions of southern and central China, including provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. This plant typically grows in moist, shady areas such as forests and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the humid climate and fertile soils of these regions. Abutilon roseum is commonly found in natural habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon roseum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with its fuzzy, rose-like flowers that attract pollinators. However, it has also been identified as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites, posing ecological challenges in certain ecosystems."
