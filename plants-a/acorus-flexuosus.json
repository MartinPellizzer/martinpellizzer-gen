    "intro": "Acorus flexuosus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, with a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist habitats, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Acorus flexuosus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.",
