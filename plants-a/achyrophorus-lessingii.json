    "intro": "Achyrophorus lessingii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals.",
