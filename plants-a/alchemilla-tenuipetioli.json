    "intro": "Alchemilla tenuipetioli, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild astringent properties. Alchemilla tenuipetioli thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens."
