    "intro": "Allium lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese garlic, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
