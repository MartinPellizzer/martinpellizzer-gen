    "intro": "Aspidocarya hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy aspidocarya, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy covering on the thallus, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The thallus is usually prostrate, with leaf-like structures that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Aspidocarya hirsuta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
