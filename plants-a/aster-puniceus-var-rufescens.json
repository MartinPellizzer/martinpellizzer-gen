    "intro": "Aster puniceus var. rufescens, commonly known as the redstem aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it has hairy, linear leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in native landscapes."
