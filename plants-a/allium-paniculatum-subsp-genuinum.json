    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. genuinum, commonly known as the Crimean garlic or the Siberian leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, branched flower stalk topped with a dense cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates. This subspecies is closely related to other Allium species and is valued for its hardiness and adaptability."
