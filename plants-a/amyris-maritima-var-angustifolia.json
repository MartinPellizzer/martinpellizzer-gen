    "intro": "Amyris maritima var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sand pine, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
