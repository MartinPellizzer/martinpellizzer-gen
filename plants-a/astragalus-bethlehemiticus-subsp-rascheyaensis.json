    "intro": "Astragalus bethlehemiticus subsp. rascheyaensis, commonly known as the Rascheyan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of the Eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species."
