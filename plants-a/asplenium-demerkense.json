It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium demerkense is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
