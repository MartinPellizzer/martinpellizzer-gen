    "intro": "Asplenium nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent, contrasting veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium nigropaleaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
