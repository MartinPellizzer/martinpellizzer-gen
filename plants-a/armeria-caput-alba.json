    "intro": "Armeria caput-alba, commonly known as the white sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. Armeria caput-alba is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
