    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha phyllonomifolia is primarily native to New Guinea. It is found in the tropical regions of this island, particularly in the lowland and montane forests. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along stream banks and in forest understories. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha phyllonomifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and tropical landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in regions with warm climates for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant is often used as a ground cover or in containers because of its compact size and vibrant leaf colors. However, it has raised concerns in some areas due to its potential to become invasive if not properly managed. Its introduction has led to increased research on its ecological impact and control methods."
