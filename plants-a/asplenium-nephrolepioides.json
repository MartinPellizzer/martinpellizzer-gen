    "intro": "Asplenium nephrolepioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can be used as a natural dye. Asplenium nephrolepioides is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
