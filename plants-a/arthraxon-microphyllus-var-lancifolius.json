It features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in grassland and wetland habitats."
