    "intro": "Adenostegia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy stemless sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of a stem, with leaves directly attached to the root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss. Adenostegia pilosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.",
