    "intro": "Alyssum psilocarpum, commonly known as the psychedelic alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, rounded seeds that are often dispersed by wind. While not a hallucinogenic species like some other members of its family, it has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific research."
