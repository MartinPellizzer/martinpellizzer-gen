    "intro": "Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora, commonly known as the silky or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and striking, showy inflorescences that often display vibrant colors. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with ciliate margins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadside verges, abandoned fields, and secondary forests. It thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its native range also extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, including southern India and Sri Lanka.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ciliata var. trichophora was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
