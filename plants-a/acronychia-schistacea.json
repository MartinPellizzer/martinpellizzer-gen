    "intro": "Acronychia schistacea, commonly known as the rock apple or stone apple, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually thick, leathery, and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Acronychia schistacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities.",
