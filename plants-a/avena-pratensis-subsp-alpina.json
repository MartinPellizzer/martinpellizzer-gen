    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces edible grains similar to other oat species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in high-altitude areas."
