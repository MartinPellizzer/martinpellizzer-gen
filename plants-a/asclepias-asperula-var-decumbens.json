    "intro": "Asclepias asperula var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and grassland habitats. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nourishment for their larvae."
