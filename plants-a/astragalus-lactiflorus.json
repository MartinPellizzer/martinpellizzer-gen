    "intro": "Astragalus lactiflorus, commonly known as the milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus lactiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
