    "intro": "Aspidium montanum var. crenatum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
