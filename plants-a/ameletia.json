    "intro": "Ameletia, commonly known as the false thornapple, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ameletia species are characterized by their woody stems and opposite leaves, which are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Some species produce berries that contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful to animals and humans."
