    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha corensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in disturbed or secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid climates and is often found near water sources. Acalypha corensis is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha corensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by humans for its aesthetic value, such as its vibrant red and green leaves. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have contributed to its success in these new environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists."
