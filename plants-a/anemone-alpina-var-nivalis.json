    "intro": "Anemone alpina var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine snow anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, silvery-green leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
