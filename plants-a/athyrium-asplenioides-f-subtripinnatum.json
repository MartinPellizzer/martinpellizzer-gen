    "intro": "Athyrium asplenioides f. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically more slender and elongated than those of the typical form. The plant exhibits a delicate, feathery appearance with a pale green to dark green coloration. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
