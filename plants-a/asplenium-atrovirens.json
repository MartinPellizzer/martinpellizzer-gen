    "intro": "Asplenium atrovirens, commonly known as the black moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically compact and clustered. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky areas. Asplenium atrovirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
