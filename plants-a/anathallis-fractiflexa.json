    "intro": "Anathallis fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexing anathallist, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous inflorescence and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, velvety coating. Anathallis fractiflexa is noted for its unique floral movement, where the flowers bend toward light, a trait that aids in pollination."
