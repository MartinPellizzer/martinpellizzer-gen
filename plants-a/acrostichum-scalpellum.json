The plant features bipinnate leaves with closely spaced, linear pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acrostichum scalpellum plays a role in providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.",
