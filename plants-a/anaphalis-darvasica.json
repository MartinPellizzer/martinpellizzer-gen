It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a fluffy, cotton-like appearance. Anaphalis darvasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
