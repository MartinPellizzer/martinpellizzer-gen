    "intro": "Andropogon ischaemum var. songaricus, commonly known as the Songaric bluestem, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
