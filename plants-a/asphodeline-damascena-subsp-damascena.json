    "intro": "Asphodeline damascena subsp. damascena, commonly known as the Damaskan asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and architectural form."
