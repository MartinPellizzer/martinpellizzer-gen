    "intro": "Antigramma rhizophylla, commonly known as the creeping antigramma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Antigramma rhizophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
