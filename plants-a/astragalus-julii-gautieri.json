    "intro": "Astragalus julii-gautieri, commonly known as the Gautier's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
