    "intro": "Acacia pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often shed during dry periods. Its bark is smooth and greyish, with a flaky texture that peels away in strips. Acacia pyrifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and ornamental species in native gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pyrifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Cape Le Grand National Park. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathlands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia pyrifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pyrifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and New Zealand, for ornamental purposes. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
