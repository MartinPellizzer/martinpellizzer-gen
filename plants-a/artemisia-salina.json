    "intro": "Artemisia salina, commonly known as shadscale sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia salina is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in harsh desert conditions. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
