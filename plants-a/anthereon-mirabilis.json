It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange or yellow flowers that resemble tiny lanterns, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. Anthereon mirabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
