    "intro": "Allium peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is covered in a fibrous sheath, and the leaves are grass-like and aromatic. Allium peninsulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
