    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelicea serrata is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean climate, including hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen in habitats such as cliffs, dunes, and coastal scrublands. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of sun-exposed, well-drained soils in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelicea serrata was mainly introduced to coastal areas with sandy or rocky substrates, where it can thrive in shallow, sun-exposed waters. It is commonly found in regions with moderate to warm climates, often near estuaries or tidal zones. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, making it adaptable to a range of marine environments. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coast of Europe. However, its spread is limited by its preference for stable, low-energy habitats."
