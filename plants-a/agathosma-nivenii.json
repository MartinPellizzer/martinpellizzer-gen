    "intro": "Agathosma nivenii, commonly known as the Cape mountain thyme, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that emit a strong, thyme-like fragrance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique aroma and habitat preferences, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of essential oils."
