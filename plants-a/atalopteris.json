    "intro": "Atalopteris, commonly known as the lace fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. Atalopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in spreading and anchoring the plant. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
