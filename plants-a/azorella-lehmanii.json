    "intro": "Azorella lehmanii, commonly known as the Lehman's azorella, is a perennial cushion plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Azorella lehmanii is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and can survive in extreme cold and strong winds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
