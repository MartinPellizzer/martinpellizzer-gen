    "intro": "Aegiceras ferreum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly resistant to decay and saltwater, making it well adapted to saline environments. The tree has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green and have a waxy coating. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by orange to red fruits that contain three seeds. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
