It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in humid and shaded conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical variety. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
