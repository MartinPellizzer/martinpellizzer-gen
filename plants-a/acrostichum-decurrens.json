    "intro": "Acrostichum decurrens, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It has long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.",
