    "intro": "Alsine cupaniana subsp. postii, commonly known as the coastal sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
