    "intro": "Alpinia floccosa, commonly known as the white ginger or woolly ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by distinctive, fluffy, white seed pods. Alpinia floccosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections."
