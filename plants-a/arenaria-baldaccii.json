    "intro": "Arenaria baldaccii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
