    "intro": "Arabis stelleri var. micrantha, commonly known as the Steller's rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of elongated, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
