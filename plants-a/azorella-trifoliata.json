    "intro": "Azorella trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf azorella, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to the high Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Azorella trifoliata is adapted to high-altitude conditions, exhibiting frost resistance and a slow growth rate."
