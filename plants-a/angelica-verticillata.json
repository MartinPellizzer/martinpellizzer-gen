    "intro": "Angelica verticillata, commonly known as the clustered angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a strong, aromatic scent. Angelica verticillata is often found in damp meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
