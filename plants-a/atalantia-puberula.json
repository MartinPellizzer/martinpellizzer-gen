    "intro": "Atalantia puberula, commonly known as the hairy atalantia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are often mistaken for ornamental fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens beyond its native range."
