    "intro": "Agrostis arida, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Agrostis arida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
