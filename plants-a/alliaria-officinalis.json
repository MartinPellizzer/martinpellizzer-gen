    "intro": "Alliaria officinalis, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pinnately divided leaves and small white or purple flowers. The plant produces rounded, three-lobed seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur compounds in its leaves and roots. Alliaria officinalis is often found in woodland areas and has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive."
