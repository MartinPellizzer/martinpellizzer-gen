    "intro": "Aulomyrcia crenulata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf aulomyrcia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a fibrous bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
