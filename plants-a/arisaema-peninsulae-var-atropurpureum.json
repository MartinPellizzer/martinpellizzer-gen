    "intro": "Arisaema peninsulae var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-veined arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves with deep purple veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. The plant produces spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers, typically in a striking yellow or orange color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its flowers. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to certain garden conditions."
