    "intro": "Antrophyum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved antrophyum, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct, sharp point, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Antrophyum cuneifolium is well adapted to humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its unique foliage."
