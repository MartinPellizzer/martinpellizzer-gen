    "intro": "Annona foetida, commonly known as the stinking cucumber, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a rough, green fruit that turns yellow when mature, containing a single large seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fruit is edible but has a strong, unpleasant odor, which gives the plant its common name."
