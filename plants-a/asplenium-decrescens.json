    "intro": "Asplenium decrescens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 inches long, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a useful ornamental plant in shaded garden settings."
