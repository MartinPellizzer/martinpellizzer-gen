    "intro": "Allamanda neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaf allamanda, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens or as a houseplant. Allamanda neriifolia is also noted for its ability to produce fruit, which contains seeds used in some traditional practices."
