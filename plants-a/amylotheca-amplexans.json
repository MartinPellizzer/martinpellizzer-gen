    "intro": "Amylotheca amplexans, commonly known as the clinging lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant's thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest regions. Amylotheca amplexans plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
