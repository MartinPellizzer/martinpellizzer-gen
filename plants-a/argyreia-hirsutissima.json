    "intro": "Argyreia hirsutissima, commonly known as the velvet flower or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Argyreia hirsutissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
