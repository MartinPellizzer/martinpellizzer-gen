    "intro": "Anagyris, commonly known as the spurred lily or desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their distinctive spurred petals, which give them their common name, and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Anagyris species typically have compound leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
