    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated pineapple, is a cultivar of the pineapple plant characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces a spiky, colorful fruit that is often smaller than the common pineapple. Its leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and exhibit a striking mix of green, white, and yellow hues. This variety is prized for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit, which has a slightly different flavor profile compared to the standard pineapple."
