    "intro": "Asplenium concisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium concisum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
