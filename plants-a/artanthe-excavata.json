    "intro": "Artanthe excavata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Artanthe excavata is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
