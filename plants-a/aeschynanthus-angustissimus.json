    "intro": "Aeschynanthus angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved slipper orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to western Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red and orange. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
