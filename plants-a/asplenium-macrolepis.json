    "intro": "Asplenium macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates like soil or rock. Asplenium macrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
