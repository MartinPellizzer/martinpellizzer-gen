    "intro": "Angraecum hislopii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Angraecum hislopii is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
