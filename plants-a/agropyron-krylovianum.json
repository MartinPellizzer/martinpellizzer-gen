It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Agropyron krylovianum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
