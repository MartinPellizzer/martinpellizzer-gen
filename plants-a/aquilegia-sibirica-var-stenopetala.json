    "intro": "Aquilegia sibirica var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled Siberian columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with finely divided leaflets, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It prefers well-drained, loamy soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
