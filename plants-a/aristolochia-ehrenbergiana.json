    "intro": "Aristolochia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive spiral pattern on the inner surface. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The genus Aristolochia is known for its complex chemical compounds, some of which have medicinal uses but also pose significant health risks."
