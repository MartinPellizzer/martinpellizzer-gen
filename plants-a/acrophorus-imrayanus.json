    "intro": "Acrophorus imrayanus, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.",
