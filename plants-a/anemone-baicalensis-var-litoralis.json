    "intro": "Anemone baicalensis var. litoralis, commonly known as the sea anemone or coastal anemone, is a variant of the Baikal anemone native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and conservation efforts."
