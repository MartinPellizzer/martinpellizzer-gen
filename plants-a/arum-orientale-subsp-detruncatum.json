    "intro": "Arum orientale subsp. detruncatum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other Arum species."
