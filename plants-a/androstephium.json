    "intro": "Androstephium, commonly known as the blue flax or blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Androstephium species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and are sometimes considered weeds. They have fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves, with the flowers being the most distinctive feature."
