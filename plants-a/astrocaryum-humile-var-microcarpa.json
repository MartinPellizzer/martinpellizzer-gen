It typically reaches a height of less than 2 meters, with a short, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface, and the plant is often found in shaded, moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
