    "intro": "Althaea broussonetiifolia, commonly known as the Broussonet's marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in arid conditions. Althaea broussonetiifolia is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
