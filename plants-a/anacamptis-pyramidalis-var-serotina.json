    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis var. serotina, commonly known as the late pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred lip and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. This variety is distinguished by its later blooming period compared to other varieties of the same species."
