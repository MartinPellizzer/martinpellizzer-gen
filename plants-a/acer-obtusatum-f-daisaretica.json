    "intro": "Acer obtusatum f. daisaretica, commonly known as the Daisaretic maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the obtusatum maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed leaves that display a striking color change from bright green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its compact growth habit and unique foliage make it a prized addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited natural range and cultivation challenges, it is considered a rare and somewhat difficult species to grow outside its native habitat.",
