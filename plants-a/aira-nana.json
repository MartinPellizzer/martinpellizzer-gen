    "intro": "Aira nana, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small air grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of less than 20 centimeters and features slender, tufted stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. Aira nana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
