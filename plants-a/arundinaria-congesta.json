    "intro": "Arundinaria congesta, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with long, narrow leaves arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. Arundinaria congesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clusters of small, three-lobed seeds."
