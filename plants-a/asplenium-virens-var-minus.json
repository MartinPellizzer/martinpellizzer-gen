    "intro": "Asplenium virens var. minus, commonly known as the small green maidenhair fern, is a compact variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and bright green fronds that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are short and often produce a dense cluster of foliage. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings or as a houseplant."
