    "intro": "Astragalus lineatus subsp. longidens, commonly known as the long-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or violet. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, narrow seed pods and long, slender seeds, which are adaptations to its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
