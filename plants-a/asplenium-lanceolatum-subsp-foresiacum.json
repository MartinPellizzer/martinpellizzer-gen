It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky habitats. Its delicate appearance and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
