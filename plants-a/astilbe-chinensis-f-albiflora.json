It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, lace-like, white flowers. The plant produces narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are attractive in both form and texture. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
