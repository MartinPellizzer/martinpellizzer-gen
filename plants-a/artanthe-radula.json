    "intro": "Artanthe radula, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, pink to red blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Artanthe radula is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions."
