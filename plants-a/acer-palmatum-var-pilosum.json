    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. pilosum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with fuzzy leaves, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple species. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer of fine hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically features an upright growth habit with a compact form, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red berries in the fall. This variety thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring moderate water and protection from harsh winter conditions.",
