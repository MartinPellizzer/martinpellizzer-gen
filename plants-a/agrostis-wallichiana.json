    "intro": "Agrostis wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Agrostis wallichiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
