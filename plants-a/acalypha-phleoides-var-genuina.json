    "intro": "Acalypha phleoides var. genuina, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features distinctive leaves with striking red veins against a dark green background, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha phleoides var. genuina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This variant is particularly common in the Indonesian archipelago, where it is adapted to the region's warm and wet climate. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha phleoides var. genuina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
