The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus depauperatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
