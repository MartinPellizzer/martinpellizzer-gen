    "intro": "Andropogon tristis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Andropogon tristis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
