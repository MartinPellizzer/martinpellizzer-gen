    "intro": "Aglitheis quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered marvel, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that bloom in vibrant shades of violet and blue. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with woody stems that develop a reddish hue as they mature. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects sunlight. Aglitheis quinqueflora is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
