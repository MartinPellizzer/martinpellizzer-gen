    "intro": "Alseis leiantha, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alseis leiantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
