    "intro": "Aconitum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive spurred shape, and it produces toxic alkaloids in its roots and tubers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
