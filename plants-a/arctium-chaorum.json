    "intro": "Arctium chaorum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces spiny, seed-containing burs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. Arctium chaorum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, thriving in temperate climates."
