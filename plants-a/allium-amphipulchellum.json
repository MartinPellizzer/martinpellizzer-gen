    "intro": "Allium amphipulchellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in flavor to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
