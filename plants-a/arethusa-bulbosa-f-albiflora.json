    "intro": "Arethusa bulbosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered arethusa, is a rare and striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, acidic wetlands and is often found in association with other wetland species. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in several states."
