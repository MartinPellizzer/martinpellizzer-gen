    "intro": "Arrabidaea egensis, commonly known as the Cape York emuwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in sandy soils and coastal conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale pink, and it produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
