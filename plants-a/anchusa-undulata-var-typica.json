    "intro": "Anchusa undulata var. typica, commonly known as the wavy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
