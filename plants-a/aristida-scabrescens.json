    "intro": "Aristida scabrescens, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. This grass is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
