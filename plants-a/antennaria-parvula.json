It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Antennaria parvula is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in open habitats like dunes and gravelly fields."
