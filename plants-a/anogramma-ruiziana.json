    "intro": "Anogramma ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, shield-shaped pinnae that give it its common name. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
