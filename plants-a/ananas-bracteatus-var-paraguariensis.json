    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a South American plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of spiny, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces a spiky, red or yellow flower spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. Yerba mate is cultivated for its leaves, which are used to make a traditional infusion. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, tropical climates of its native range."
