    "intro": "Anemone ranunculoides, commonly known as the water anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to wet habitats in North America. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a short, stout stem and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and pond edges. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to true anemones, though it is botanically classified in the Ranunculaceae family."
