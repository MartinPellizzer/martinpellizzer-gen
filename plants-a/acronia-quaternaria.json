    "intro": "Acronia quaternaria, commonly known as the four-parted acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique quadrifoliate leaves, which consist of four leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Acronia quaternaria thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range.",
