    "intro": "Amsinckia ammophila, commonly known as the beach bur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers bloom in the spring, producing yellowish-green petals and producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Amsinckia ammophila is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal areas, making it a common sight along beaches and dunes."
