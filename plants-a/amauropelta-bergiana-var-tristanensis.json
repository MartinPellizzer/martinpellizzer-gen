    "intro": "Amauropelta bergiana var. tristanensis, commonly known as Tristan rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found on the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
