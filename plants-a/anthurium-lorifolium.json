    "intro": "Anthurium lorifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the tiny, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium lorifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
