    "intro": "Asplenium discrepans, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fronds, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. Asplenium discrepans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
