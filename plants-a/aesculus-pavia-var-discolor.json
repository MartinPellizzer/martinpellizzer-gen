    "intro": "Aesculus pavia var. discolor, commonly known as the Eastern scarlet buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that appear in clusters, followed by spiny, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces large, showy, yellow-orange fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native gardens."
