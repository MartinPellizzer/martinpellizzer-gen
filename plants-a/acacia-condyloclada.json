    "intro": "Acacia condyloclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to poor soils and drought conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia condyloclada is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in shrubland and savanna ecosystems. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals. The plant is also sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia condyloclada was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant has been introduced to several parts of California, including the Santa Barbara and San Diego regions. It is commonly used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
