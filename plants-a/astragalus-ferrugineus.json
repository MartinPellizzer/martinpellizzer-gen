It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Astragalus ferrugineus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
