    "intro": "Astragalus arenarius, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
