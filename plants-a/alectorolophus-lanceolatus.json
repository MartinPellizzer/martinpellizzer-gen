    "intro": "Alectorolophus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
