    "intro": "Alsine tomentosa, commonly known as wooly alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and grasslands. Alsine tomentosa is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along the edges of woodlands."
