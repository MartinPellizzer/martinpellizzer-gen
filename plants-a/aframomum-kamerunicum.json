    "intro": "Aframomum kamerunicum, commonly known as African cardamom, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, red-orange fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in lowland rainforests."
