    "intro": "Achoriphragma sauricum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, succulent stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Achoriphragma sauricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.",
