    "intro": "Alopecurus gerardi var. cassius, commonly known as hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
