    "intro": "Artemisia genipi var. laxiuscula, commonly known as the Mexican tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in cooking, particularly in traditional Mexican cuisine, for their distinctive, anise-like flavor. This variety is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
