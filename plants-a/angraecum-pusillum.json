    "intro": "Angraecum pusillum, commonly known as the tiny angraecum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces fragrant, white flowers with long, slender sepals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
