    "intro": "Antidesma cauliflorum, commonly known as the calico tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit and timber."
