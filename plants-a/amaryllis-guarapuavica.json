    "intro": "Amaryllis guarapuavica, commonly known as the Guaran\u00ed amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It features tall, strap-like leaves and produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, often nutrient-poor conditions of the rainforest. This species is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its ecological role in its native habitat."
