    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
