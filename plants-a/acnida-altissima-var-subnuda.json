    "intro": "Acnida altissima var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked acnida, is a shrub native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that dehisces to release seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.",
