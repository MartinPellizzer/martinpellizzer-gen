    "intro": "Astragalus tenuispinus, commonly known as the slenderstem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus tenuispinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
