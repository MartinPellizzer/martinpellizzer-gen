    "intro": "Alifana canescens, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Alifana canescens is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
