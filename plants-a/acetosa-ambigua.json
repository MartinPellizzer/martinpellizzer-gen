    "intro": "Acetosa ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its scientific name reflects the uncertainty in its classification, as it was once considered a hybrid or variant of other species. Acetosa ambigua is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.",
