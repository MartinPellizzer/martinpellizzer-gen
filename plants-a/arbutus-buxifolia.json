The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark purple when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Arbutus buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
