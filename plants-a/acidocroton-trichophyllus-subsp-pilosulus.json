It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The flowers are clustered in panicles and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits.",
