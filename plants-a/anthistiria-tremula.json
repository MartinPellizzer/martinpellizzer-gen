    "intro": "Anthistiria tremula, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Anthistiria tremula is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
