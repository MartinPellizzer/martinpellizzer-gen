It is characterized by its large, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are elongated, leaf-like structures that enclose the inflorescence. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish with a distinctive, hooded shape that resembles a cobra's head. This variant is prized for its dramatic foliage and unique floral structure in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
