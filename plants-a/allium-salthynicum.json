    "intro": "Allium salthynicum, commonly known as the salt marsh garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are small and often covered in a fibrous sheath. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas and is also used in traditional medicine."
