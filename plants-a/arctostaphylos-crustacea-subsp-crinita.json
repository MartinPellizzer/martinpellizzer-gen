    "intro": "Arctostaphylos crustacea subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The hairy manzanita is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
