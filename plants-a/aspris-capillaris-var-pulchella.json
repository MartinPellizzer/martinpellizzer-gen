It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that bear clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important component of native plant ecosystems."
