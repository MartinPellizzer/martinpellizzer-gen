    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 humilis, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dark green, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of other ajuga species. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga \u00d7 humilis thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is relatively easy to maintain once established."
