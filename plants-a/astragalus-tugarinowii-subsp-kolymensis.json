    "intro": "Astragalus tugarinowii subsp. kolymensis, commonly known as the Kolyma milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Russia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, arctic or alpine soils, often found in tundra or steppe environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and it produces small, yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
