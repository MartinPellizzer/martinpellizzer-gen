    "intro": "Avenastrum ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Outerdorf's bluegrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Austrian Alps. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments with limited nutrient availability, making it a specialist of alpine ecosystems. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
