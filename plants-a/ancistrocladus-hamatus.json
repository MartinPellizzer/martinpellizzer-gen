It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
