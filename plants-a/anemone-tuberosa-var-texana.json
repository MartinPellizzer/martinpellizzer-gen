    "intro": "Anemone tuberosa var. texana, commonly known as the Texas anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for native gardens. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of drought and cold, contributing to its hardiness in temperate climates."
