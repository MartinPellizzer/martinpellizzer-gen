    "intro": "Actinostemon verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. Actinostemon verrucosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought-prone environments.",
