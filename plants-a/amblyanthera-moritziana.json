    "intro": "Amblyanthera moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's amblyanthera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and they bloom during the rainy season. Amblyanthera moritziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
