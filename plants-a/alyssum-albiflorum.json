    "intro": "Alyssum albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact foliage and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alyssum albiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
