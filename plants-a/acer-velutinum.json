    "intro": "Acer velutinum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
