    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallianus var. austrinus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
