    "intro": "Agave wislizeni, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a large, columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with sharp spines protecting its surface. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers on branched inflorescences, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Agave wislizeni is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in desert gardens."
