    "intro": "Auricula minima, commonly known as the dwarf auricula, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
