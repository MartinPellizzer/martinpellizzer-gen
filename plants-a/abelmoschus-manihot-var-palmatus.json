It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly grown as a food crop. It is known for its starchy roots, which are used in various culinary preparations. Its native distribution includes areas with a humid climate and adequate rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot var. palmatus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its potential as a cash crop and food source. It is particularly valued for its high starch content and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America as part of agricultural development programs. Its introduction has also been linked to efforts to combat food insecurity and provide alternative income sources for local communities. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
