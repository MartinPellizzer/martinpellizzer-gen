    "intro": "Alectorolophus glacialis, commonly known as the glacial bellflower, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
