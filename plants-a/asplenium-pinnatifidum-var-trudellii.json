    "intro": "Asplenium pinnatifidum var. trudellii, commonly known as the Trudell's spleenwort, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a slightly glossy texture. The spores are produced on the undersides of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats."
