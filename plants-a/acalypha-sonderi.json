    "intro": "Acalypha sonderi, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescent (hairy) leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Acalypha sonderi is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",

It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The Cape Provinces provide the ideal climate and environmental conditions for its growth. It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sonderi was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions across the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats, where it spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some parts of New Zealand. Its distribution has been expanding, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
