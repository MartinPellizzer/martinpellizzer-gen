    "intro": "Acalypha tenuiramea, commonly known as narrow-leaf jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces unique, bead-like seed capsules that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuiramea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in disturbed or cultivated areas near its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuiramea was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond intended areas."
