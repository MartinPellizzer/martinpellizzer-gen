It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal or lowland areas with well-drained soil. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom throughout the year in tropical climates. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
