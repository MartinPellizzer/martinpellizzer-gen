It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments. Astragalus aegiceras plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
