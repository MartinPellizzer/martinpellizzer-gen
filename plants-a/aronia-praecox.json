    "intro": "Aronia praecox, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in early summer. The plant is known for its high antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, which give the berries their deep color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Aronia praecox is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruits used in jams and teas."
