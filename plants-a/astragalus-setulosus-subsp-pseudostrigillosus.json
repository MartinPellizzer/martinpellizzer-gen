    "intro": "Astragalus setulosus subsp. pseudostrigillosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically compound, with finely divided leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry plains and open woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for wildlife."
