It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Aegilops fluviatilis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
