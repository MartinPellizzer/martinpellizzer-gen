    "intro": "Azorella ranunculacea, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in the harsh, cold, and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Azorella ranunculacea is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
