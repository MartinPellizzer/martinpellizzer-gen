    "intro": "Amphiscopia beyrichii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of around 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike. The flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, elongated labellum that is often spotted or striped. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or seasonal flooding. This variety is less common than its larger relative, Amphiscopia beyrichii, and is considered a delicate, specialized species."
