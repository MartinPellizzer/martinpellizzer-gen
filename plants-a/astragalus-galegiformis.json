    "intro": "Astragalus galegiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy pod and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Astragalus galegiformis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
