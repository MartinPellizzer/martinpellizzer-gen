    "intro": "Atriplex cordubensis subsp. cordubensis, commonly known as the Iberian saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its succulent, glabrous leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spike-like clusters, which are borne on terminal and axillary inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and inland saltmarsh habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
