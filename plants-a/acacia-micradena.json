    "intro": "Acacia micradena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. These flowers are followed by long, slender pods that contain seeds. Acacia micradena is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia micradena is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate periods of drought. Acacia micradena plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia micradena was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and degraded landscapes. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
