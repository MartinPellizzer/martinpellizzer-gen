    "intro": "Alchemilla wilmsii, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla wilmsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
