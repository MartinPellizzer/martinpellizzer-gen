    "intro": "Acantholimon glabratum subsp. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. It is generally low-growing, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and is adapted to arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.",

It typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran. It is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon glabratum subsp. glabratum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing on slopes or in open grasslands. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a low, spreading growth habit. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. However, it may spread aggressively in certain regions, posing a potential risk to native plant communities."
