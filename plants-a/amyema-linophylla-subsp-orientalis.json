    "intro": "Amyema linophylla subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
