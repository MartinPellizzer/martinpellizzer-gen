    "intro": "Artemisia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Artemisia angustifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
