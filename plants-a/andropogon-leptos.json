    "intro": "Andropogon leptos, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon leptos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
