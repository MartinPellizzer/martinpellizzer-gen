    "intro": "Asparagopsis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus fern, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light for optimal growth."
