    "intro": "Agrostis dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, particularly the Balkans. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which produce wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis dalmatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive lawns."
