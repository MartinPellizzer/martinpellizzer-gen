    "intro": "Allium kujukense, commonly known as the Kujuk Valley garlic, is a bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
