    "intro": "Abronia mellifera var. pahoveorum, commonly known as the Pahovean sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in areas with suitable habitat conditions. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often associated with sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The variety is known for its small, clustered flowers and is adapted to the arid climate of Idaho. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia mellifera var. pahoveorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy plains where it thrives in dry, coastal environments. This plant is known for its small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has been successfully established in several botanical gardens and conservation areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
