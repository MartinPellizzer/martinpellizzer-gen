    "intro": "Acmadenia rupicola, commonly known as the rock acmadenia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.",
