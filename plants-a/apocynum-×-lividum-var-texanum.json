    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 lividum var. texanum, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a hybrid species within the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. This species thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
