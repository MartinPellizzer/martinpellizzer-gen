    "intro": "Alsine rostrata proles petraea, commonly known as the rock alsike, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes."
