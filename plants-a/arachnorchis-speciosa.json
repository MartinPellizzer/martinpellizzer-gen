    "intro": "Arachnorchis speciosa, commonly known as the showy spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like floral structure with long, slender petals and a distinctive, club-shaped spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing vibrant purple or pink hues that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
