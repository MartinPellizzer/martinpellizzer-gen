    "intro": "Alstonia muelleriana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alstonia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and pinnately compound leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are yellowish-green in color, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional use."
