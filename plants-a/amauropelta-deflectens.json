    "intro": "Amauropelta deflectens, commonly known as the bent-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are often curved or bent, giving it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of ferns."
