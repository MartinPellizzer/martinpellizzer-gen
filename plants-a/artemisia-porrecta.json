    "intro": "Artemisia porrecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. Artemisia porrecta is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. Its essential oils, which contain compounds like thujone, have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
