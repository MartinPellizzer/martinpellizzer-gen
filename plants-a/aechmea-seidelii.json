    "intro": "Aechmea seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spiky leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red bracts that surround a spadix of small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Aechmea seidelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
