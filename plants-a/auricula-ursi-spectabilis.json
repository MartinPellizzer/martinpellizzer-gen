    "intro": "Auricula-ursi spectabilis, commonly known as the showy bear's ear, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
