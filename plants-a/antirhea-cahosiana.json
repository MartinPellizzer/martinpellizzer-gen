    "intro": "Antirhea cahosiana, commonly known as the Chagos antirhea, is a flowering plant native to the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Due to its remote habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
