    "intro": "Acacia woodii, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, seed-bearing pods that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia woodii is primarily native to the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in rocky soils and crevices within arid and semi-arid regions. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often associated with limestone formations and is well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia woodii was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. This plant is often used for its hard, durable wood, which makes it valuable for construction and crafting. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been planted in various regions beyond its native range."
