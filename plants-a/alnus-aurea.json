    "intro": "Alnus aurea, commonly known as the golden alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and catkin flowers, which appear in early spring. The tree has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types, including moist and well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and can thrive in areas with moderate to high moisture levels. Alnus aurea also plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
