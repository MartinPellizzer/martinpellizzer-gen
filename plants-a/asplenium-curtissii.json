    "intro": "Asplenium curtissii, commonly known as the curly-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that curl tightly at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium curtissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
