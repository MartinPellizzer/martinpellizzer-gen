    "intro": "Arabis crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, broad leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Arabis crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
