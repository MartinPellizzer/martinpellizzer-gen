    "intro": "Ampelopsis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes Ampelopsis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically medium to large in size, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within forests. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
