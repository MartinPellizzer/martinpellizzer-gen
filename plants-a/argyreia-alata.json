    "intro": "Argyreia alata, commonly known as the holy leaf or sacred lotus, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a houseplant. However, it is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of certain alkaloids in its leaves."
