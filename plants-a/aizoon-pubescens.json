    "intro": "Aizoon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Aizoon pubescens is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
