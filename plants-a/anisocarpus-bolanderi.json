    "intro": "Anisocarpus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its leaves are compound with several leaflets. It is characterized by its unique seed pods that are twisted and asymmetrical, giving it the species name \"anisocarpus,\" meaning unequal fruit. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
