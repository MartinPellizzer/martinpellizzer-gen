    "intro": "Alstonia theiformis, commonly known as the silky tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted trunk that resembles a tree without branches. The plant has large, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Alstonia theiformis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
