    "intro": "Allium victoris, commonly known as the Scottish leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and northern England. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Its bulbs, which are edible, have a mild, leek-like flavor and are sometimes used in local cuisine. Allium victoris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows."
