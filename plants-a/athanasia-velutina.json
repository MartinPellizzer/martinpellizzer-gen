    "intro": "Athanasia velutina, commonly known as the velvet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. Athanasia velutina is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
