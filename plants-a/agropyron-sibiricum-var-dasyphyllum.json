    "intro": "Agropyron sibiricum var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing several small, awned grains. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and cold temperatures. This variety is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
