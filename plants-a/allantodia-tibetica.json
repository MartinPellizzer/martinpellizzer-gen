    "intro": "Allantodia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
