    "intro": "Astragalus guatemalensis var. brevidentatus, commonly known as the Guatemalan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, brown seed pods. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native environment."
