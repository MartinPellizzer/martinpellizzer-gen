    "intro": "Aspidium conspersum, commonly known as the scaly water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scaly structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium conspersum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
