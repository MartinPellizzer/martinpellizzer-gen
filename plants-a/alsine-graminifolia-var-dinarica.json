    "intro": "Alsine graminifolia var. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric Alsine, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, contributing to its subtle appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
