    "intro": "Anemone peneensis, commonly known as the desert anemone, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low, spreading growth habit, featuring fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in its dry habitat. Anemone peneensis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
