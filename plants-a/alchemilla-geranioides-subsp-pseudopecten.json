    "intro": "Alchemilla geranioides subsp. pseudopecten, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white undersides that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
