    "intro": "Anacyclus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, feathery inflorescences that resemble the beard of a goat, hence their common name. Anacyclus species are typically herbaceous and perennial, with narrow, grass-like leaves. They are native to various regions in the Mediterranean, Africa, and parts of Asia. The flowers are usually yellow or white, and they produce small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind."
