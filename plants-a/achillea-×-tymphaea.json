    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 tymphaea, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (meadow yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and floral characteristics. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
