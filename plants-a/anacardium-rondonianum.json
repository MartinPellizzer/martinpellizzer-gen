    "intro": "Anacardium rondonianum, commonly known as the Rondonian cashew, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped fruits that contain a single seed enclosed in a hard, spiny husk. The fruit's outer layer contains a toxic resin, similar to that of the cashew nut, which requires careful processing. This plant is valued for its potential economic and medicinal uses in its native region."
