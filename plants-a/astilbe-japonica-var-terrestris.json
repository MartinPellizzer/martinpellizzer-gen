    "intro": "Astilbe japonica var. terrestris, commonly known as the Japanese feather reed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features delicate, fern-like foliage that emerges early in the spring. The plant produces panicles of pale pink to white flowers in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal touch to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for adding texture and color to shaded landscapes."
