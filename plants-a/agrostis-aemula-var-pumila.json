    "intro": "Agrostis aemula var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, making it well-suited for ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant and a popular choice for lawn and landscaping applications."
