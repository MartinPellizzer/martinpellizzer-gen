    "intro": "Audibertiella, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer months, adding a unique ornamental value to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Audibertiella is considered a species of conservation concern."
