    "intro": "Astragalus schrenkianus, commonly known as Schrenk's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This adaptability makes it a resilient species in harsh ecological conditions."
