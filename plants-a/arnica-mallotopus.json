    "intro": "Arnica mallotopus, commonly known as the mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, sticky hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Arnica mallotopus is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less commonly used than other arnica species."
