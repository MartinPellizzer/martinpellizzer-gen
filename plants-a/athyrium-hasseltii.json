    "intro": "Athyrium hasseltii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with golden or brown spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Athyrium hasseltii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
