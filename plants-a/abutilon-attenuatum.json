    "intro": "Abutilon attenuatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon attenuatum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its native range extends into northern South America, particularly in regions with a warm and humid climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon attenuatum was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique, lantern-shaped flowers and attractive foliage. The plant thrives in coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. It has since become naturalized in some areas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
