    "intro": "Androsace erecta, commonly known as the upright sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Androsace erecta is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and mountainous areas."
