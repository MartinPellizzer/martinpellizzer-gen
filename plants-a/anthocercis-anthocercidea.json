    "intro": "Anthocercis anthocercidea, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small stars, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
