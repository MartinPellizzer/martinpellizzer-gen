    "intro": "Arrhenatherum phaneroneuron, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in hue. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. Arrhenatherum phaneroneuron is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
