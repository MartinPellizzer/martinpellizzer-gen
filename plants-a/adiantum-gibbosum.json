    "intro": "Adiantum gibbosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Adiantum gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.",
