    "intro": "Aletris nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese grass-of-parnassus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in mountainous regions. Aletris nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
