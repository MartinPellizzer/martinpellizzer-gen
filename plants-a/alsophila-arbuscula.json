    "intro": "Alsophila arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant has a crown of feathery fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Alsophila arbuscula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a tropical ambiance in gardens."
