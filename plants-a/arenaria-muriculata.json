    "intro": "Arenaria muriculata, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Arenaria muriculata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is a characteristic species of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
