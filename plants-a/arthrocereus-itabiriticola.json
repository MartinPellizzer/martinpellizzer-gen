    "intro": "Arthrocereus itabiriticola, commonly known as the Itabiritic Cereus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces white, night-blooming flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
