    "intro": "Artemisia wadei, commonly known as Wade's wormwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia wadei is adapted to drought conditions, with small leaves that reduce water loss. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
