It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Arnica incana is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common compared to other arnica species."
