    "intro": "Arenaria unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptations to harsh climates."
