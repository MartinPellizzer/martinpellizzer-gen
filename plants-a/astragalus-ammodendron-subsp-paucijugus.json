    "intro": "Astragalus ammodendron subsp. paucijugus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing small, yellow flowers clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oblong leaflets that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
