    "intro": "Angelica anomala f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent angelica, is a variant of the angelica plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features large, compound leaves with a distinctive, aromatic scent, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The pubescent form is characterized by its hairy or pubescent surface on stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of angelica."
