    "intro": "Agropyron spicatum f. inerme, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
