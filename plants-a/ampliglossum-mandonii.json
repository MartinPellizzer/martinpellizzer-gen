It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal or semi-arid regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
