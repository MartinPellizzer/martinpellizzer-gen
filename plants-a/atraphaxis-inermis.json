    "intro": "Atraphaxis inermis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the spring. Atraphaxis inermis is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from underground sources. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-maintenance landscapes."
