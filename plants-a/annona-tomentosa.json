It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant has a rough, hairy texture on its leaves and stems, which gives it its scientific name \"tomentosa,\" meaning \"woolly.\" Its fruit is characterized by a thick, sweet, creamy pulp with a distinct aroma.
