    "intro": "Achnatherum henryi, commonly known as Henry's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Achnatherum henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments.",
