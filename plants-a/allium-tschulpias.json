    "intro": "Allium tschulpias, commonly known as the Siberian garlic or mountain garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like scent, which is most noticeable when the foliage is crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Allium tschulpias is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
