    "intro": "Agrostis royleana, commonly known as the Himalayan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Agrostis royleana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
