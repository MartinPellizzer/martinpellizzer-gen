    "intro": "Austronea trichophylla, commonly known as the silky hair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Austronea trichophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
