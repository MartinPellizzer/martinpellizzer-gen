It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often split into two at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Arundo fissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket weaving."
