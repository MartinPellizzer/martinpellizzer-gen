    "intro": "Acacia caesia var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. The wood of this species is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caesia var. oxyphylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variety is commonly found in savannahs, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant is often used as a source of firewood and has cultural significance in some local communities. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that support its growth and survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caesia var. oxyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia for ornamental purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
