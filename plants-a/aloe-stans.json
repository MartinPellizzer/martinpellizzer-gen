    "intro": "Aloe stans, commonly known as the Natal aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, blooming in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties. Aloe stans is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
