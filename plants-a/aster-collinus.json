    "intro": "Aster collinus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, showy flowers bloom in the summer, adding color to its native habitat. Aster collinus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
