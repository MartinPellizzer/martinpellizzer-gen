    "intro": "Aechmea viridostigma, commonly known as the green-stained aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest. Its foliage is typically broad and glossy, with a deep green hue that intensifies under sunlight. Aechmea viridostigma is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
