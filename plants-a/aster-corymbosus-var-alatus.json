    "intro": "Aster corymbosus var. alatus, commonly known as the winged aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, typically in shades of purple, pink, or white. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver, and its stems are covered in fine, wing-like structures, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
