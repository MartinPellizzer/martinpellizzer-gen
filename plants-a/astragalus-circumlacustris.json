    "intro": "Astragalus circumlacustris, commonly known as the lake-margin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils near lakes and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus circumlacustris plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
