    "intro": "Aphelandra schieferae, commonly known as the Schiefer's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble flames, with bright yellow bracts and orange-red flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, ovate leaves that provide a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Aphelandra schieferae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic floral display."
