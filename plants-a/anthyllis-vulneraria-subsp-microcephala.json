It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves and produces small, stipitate pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often found in the Mediterranean region. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
