    "intro": "Acer ornatum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a unique variant of the ornamental maple tree. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically 10\u201315 cm in length, with a smooth, waxy surface and a distinct reddish or bronze coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse with the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. This form is less common than the standard Acer ornatum and is prized for its distinctive foliage.",
