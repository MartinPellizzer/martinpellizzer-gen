    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. discolor is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is well adapted to humid, warm climates and often grows in disturbed or open habitats. It is also known to occur in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba. Its native range extends into parts of Central America, where it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. discolor was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The distribution of this species has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand, primarily in the North Island. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Despite its ornamental value, it is not considered a major invasive species in the region."
