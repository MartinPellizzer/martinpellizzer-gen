    "intro": "Allium vineale subsp. capsuliferum, commonly known as the slender leek or bulbous garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in the summer. Its bulbs are small and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is closely related to other alliums, such as garlic and onions, but differs in its growth habit and floral structure."
