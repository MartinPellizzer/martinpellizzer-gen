    "intro": "Aralia laevis, commonly known as the smooth aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically arranged in a feathery, panicle-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its berries, which mature to a dark blue color, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
