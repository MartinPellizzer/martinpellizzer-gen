    "intro": "Alsine lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowering alsine, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Alsine lateriflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for small herbivores in its native range."
