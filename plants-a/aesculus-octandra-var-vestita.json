    "intro": "Aesculus octandra var. vestita, commonly known as the naked horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately compound leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, followed by spiny, globose fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Hippocastanaceae family. The variety 'vestita' is distinguished by its lack of bracts, giving it a more elegant appearance compared to other varieties."
