    "intro": "Asplenium buettneri var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
