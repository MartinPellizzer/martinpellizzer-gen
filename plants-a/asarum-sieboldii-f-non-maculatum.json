    "intro": "Asarum sieboldii f. non-maculatum, commonly known as the non-spotted Japanese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a thick, rhizomatous root system and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring. Its aromatic leaves and rhizomes have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. This variety is distinguished by the absence of the characteristic red spots found on the leaves of the typical form."
