    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are covered in fine, downy hairs. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in woodland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different flower structure and coloration compared to the typical form of Aquilegia canadensis."
