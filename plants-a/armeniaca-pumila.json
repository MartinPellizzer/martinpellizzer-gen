    "intro": "Armeniaca pumila, commonly known as the dwarf peach, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but typically not as flavorful as those of its cultivated relatives. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
