    "intro": "Acer barbinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes and finely serrated margins. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. The tree produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer barbinerve is primarily native to Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye. This species is commonly found in the temperate forests of these regions. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate climates. The plant is often associated with mountainous terrain in its natural habitat. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations in East Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer barbinerve was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks, particularly in the eastern and central United States. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread outside of cultivated settings is still being monitored. Its distribution remains largely confined to human-modified landscapes rather than wild ecosystems."
