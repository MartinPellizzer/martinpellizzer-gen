    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf maidenhair fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated, with a serrated edge. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a distinctive bifurcated structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
