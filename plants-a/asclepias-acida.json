    "intro": "Asclepias acida, commonly known as sour milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called corona. Its milky sap contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweed species. Asclepias acida plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
