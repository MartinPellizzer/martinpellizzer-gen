    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. littoralis, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines."
