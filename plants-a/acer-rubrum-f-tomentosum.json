    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy red maple, is a variant of the red maple tree characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical red maple, with leaves that are often more pubescent, especially on the underside. The leaves are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It is native to the eastern United States and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its unique texture and seasonal color display in gardens and natural settings.",
