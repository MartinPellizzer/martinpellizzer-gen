It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium meyenianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
