    "intro": "Azorella apoda, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Azorella apoda is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil, making it a resilient member of alpine ecosystems."
