    "intro": "Anthactinia napalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthactinia napalensis is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows."
