It typically grows in humid, forested areas with rich soil. The species is adapted to the warm and moist climate of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthella pulchra was mainly introduced to new environments due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been found in regions with warm climates, particularly in parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common choice for gardeners. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into natural habitats."
