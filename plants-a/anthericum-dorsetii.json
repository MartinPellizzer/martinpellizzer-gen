It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and heathland habitats. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
