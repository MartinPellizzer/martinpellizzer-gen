    "intro": "Andrachne aspera, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Andrachne aspera is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
