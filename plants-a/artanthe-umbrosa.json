    "intro": "Artanthe umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow's artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Artanthe umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
