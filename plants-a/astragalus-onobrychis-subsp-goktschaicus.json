    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis subsp. goktschaicus, commonly known as the Turkish milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil enrichment."
