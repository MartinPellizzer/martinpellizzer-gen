    "intro": "Acalypha leptomyura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue berries that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage, while the berries are the main ornamental feature of the plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha leptomyura is primarily native to Madagascar. This species is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including forested areas and coastal regions. It thrives in the tropical climate that Madagascar is known for. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments within the island's native vegetation. Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leptomyura was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become established in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in coastal and urban environments, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it has the potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain areas. Its distribution is currently limited to specific regions, but ongoing monitoring is recommended to assess its ecological impact."
