    "intro": "Acerates obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acerates obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage and seasonal interest.",
