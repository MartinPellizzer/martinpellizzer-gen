    "intro": "Aeluropus sinensis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and extreme drought conditions. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. Aeluropus sinensis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils due to its extensive root system."
