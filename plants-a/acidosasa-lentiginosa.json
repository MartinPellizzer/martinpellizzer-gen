    "intro": "Acidosasa lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in small, dark spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Acidosasa lentiginosa is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",
