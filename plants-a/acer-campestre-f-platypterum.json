It is valued for its compact size, attractive foliage, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This cultivar is often used in gardens and as a street tree due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. It has been widely planted in Europe and North America as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
