    "intro": "Alsophila cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarred tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, scaly bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor deeply into the soil, supporting its growth in moist, shaded environments. Alsophila cicatricosa is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
