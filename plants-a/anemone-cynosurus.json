    "intro": "Anemone cynosurus, commonly known as the lesser anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with numerous fibrous roots, and its leaves are palmately divided with a waxy, hairy surface. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five to nine petal-like sepals that surround a cluster of yellow stamens. Anemone cynosurus is often found in damp soils and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
