    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula f. mollis, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its soft, hairy leaves. This plant is native to certain regions of North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dense covering of fine hairs, giving them a silky texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind."
