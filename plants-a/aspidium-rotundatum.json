    "intro": "Aspidium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The leaves are usually rounded and have a distinctive, almost circular shape, contributing to its common name."
