    "intro": "Alisma michaletii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its rhizomatous root system anchoring it in muddy substrates. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Alisma michaletii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
