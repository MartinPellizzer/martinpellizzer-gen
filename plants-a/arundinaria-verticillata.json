    "intro": "Arundinaria verticillata, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or black bamboo, is a species of grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brown flowers, which appear in late summer. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread rapidly through underground growth. Arundinaria verticillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
