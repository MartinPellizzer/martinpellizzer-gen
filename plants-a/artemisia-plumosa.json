    "intro": "Artemisia plumosa, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features silvery-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapic gardens. Its aromatic leaves release a strong, often pungent scent when crushed, which is a characteristic feature of the Artemisia genus."
