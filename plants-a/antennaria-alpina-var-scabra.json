    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. scabra, commonly known as the rough mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, rough textures, contributing to its common name. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
