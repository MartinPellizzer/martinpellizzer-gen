    "intro": "Aquilegia magnolii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia cress, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, doubly compound leaves and showy, spurred flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, making it a compact addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, and is known for its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant, often pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
