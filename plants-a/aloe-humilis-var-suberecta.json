    "intro": "Aloe humilis var. suberecta, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaf aloe, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features linear, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and upright, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on branched inflorescences during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
