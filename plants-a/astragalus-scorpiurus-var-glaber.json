    "intro": "Astragalus scorpiurus var. glaber, commonly known as the naked scorpionhawthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by narrow, inflated pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often growing in rocky soils and on dry slopes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
