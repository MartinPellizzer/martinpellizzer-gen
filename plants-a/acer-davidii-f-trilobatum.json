    "intro": "Acer davidii f. trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three narrow, elongated lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique foliage makes it a standout in the landscape, especially during the autumn months.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer davidii f. trilobatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It thrives in humid, temperate climates at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This variety is commonly found in mixed forests and along stream banks in these areas. It is well adapted to the cool and moist conditions typical of its native habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer davidii f. trilobatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique trifoliate leaves and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal. The plant is well-suited for temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often used as a specimen tree or in mixed borders. Its introduction has expanded its distribution beyond its native range in China."
