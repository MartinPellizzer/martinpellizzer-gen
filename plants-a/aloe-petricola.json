    "intro": "Aloe petricola, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season. Aloe petricola is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices, which provides it with protection from harsh weather. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived species, often surviving for several decades in its natural habitat."
