    "intro": "Atractylis lyrata f. ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf goldenrod, is a rare and distinctive variant of the goldenrod genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of three leaflets on each leaf, which is a key botanical feature distinguishing it from other goldenrod species. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
