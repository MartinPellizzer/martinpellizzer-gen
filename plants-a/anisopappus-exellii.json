    "intro": "Anisopappus exellii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's milkweed-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
