    "intro": "Anogra gypsophila, commonly known as the desert poppy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppies and related species. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and often have a distinctive, papery texture. Anogra gypsophila is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found growing on rocky soils or in desert landscapes."
