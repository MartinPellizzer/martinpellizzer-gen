    "intro": "Alyxia cylindrocarpa subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf alyxia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that contains a single seed. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
