The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Andropogon rudis is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration ecology projects."
