    "intro": "Amentotaxus assamica, commonly known as the Assam yew, is a rare and endangered evergreen conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping cones and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones on the same tree, a feature known as monoecy. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
