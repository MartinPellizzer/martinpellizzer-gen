    "intro": "Asperula tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle floral display to shaded woodland areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asperula tenuiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and fragrant blossoms."
