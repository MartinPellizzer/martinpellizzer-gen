    "intro": "Alchemilla sciadiophylla, commonly known as the shade-leaf alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are known for their ability to exude a milky sap, a trait common among the Alchemilla genus."
