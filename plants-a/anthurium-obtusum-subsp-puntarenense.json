    "intro": "Anthurium obtusum subsp. puntarenense, commonly known as the Puntarenas anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are elongated, spathaceous inflorescences that are usually bright red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
