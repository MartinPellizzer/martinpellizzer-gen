    "intro": "Acantholimon trojanum, commonly known as the Trojan thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with a sprawling stem and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acantholimon trojanum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a distinct vascular system and the ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, known for their vascular structures and often having spore-producing reproductive systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many early-diverging lineages and is characterized by their diverse floral structures. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flowers and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants known for their often blue or purple flowers and the presence of certain chemical compounds. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy flowers. Its species is Acantholimon trojanum, a specific plant within the genus known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon trojanum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often associated with open habitats such as steppes and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon trojanum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and disturbed agricultural lands. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. The plant is known for its ability to colonize disturbed sites quickly, making it a common invasive species in certain parts of its range. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species, altering local ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
