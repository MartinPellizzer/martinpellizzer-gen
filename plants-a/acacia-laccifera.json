    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia laccifera is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It is also found in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia and Eritrea. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. It is commonly found in dry woodlands and scrublands, where it plays an important ecological role. Due to its resilience, it is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia laccifera was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been successfully established in regions of Australia, parts of Southeast Asia, and some areas of the Pacific Islands. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is commonly planted for erosion control and as a source of timber and fuel."
