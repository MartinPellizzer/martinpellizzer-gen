    "intro": "Anthemis alpestris f. ligulata, commonly known as the Alpine tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and is native to alpine regions of Europe. The plant features small, yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
