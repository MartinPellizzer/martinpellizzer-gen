    "intro": "Arenaria iochanensis, commonly known as the Iochan sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its adaptations include a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-desert habitats."
