    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its unique green foliage and fruit. This variety is notable for its elongated, spiky leaves that are often more vibrant in color compared to the standard pineapple. The fruit of Ananassa sativa var. viridis tends to be smaller and less sweet than the common pineapple, with a firmer texture. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. Despite its rarity, it holds significance in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and unique morphological traits."
