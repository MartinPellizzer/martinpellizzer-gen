It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows and open slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
