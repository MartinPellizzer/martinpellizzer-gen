    "intro": "Aspalathus ciliaris, commonly known as the sweet tea plant, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the local climate, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is notable for its use in the production of Rooibos tea, although it is often confused with Aspalathus linearis. Its botanical features make it an important component of the fynbos vegetation in its native habitat."
