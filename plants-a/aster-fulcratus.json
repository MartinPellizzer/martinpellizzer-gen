    "intro": "Aster fulcratus, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are typically surrounded by yellow ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aster fulcratus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
