    "intro": "Asclepias bicuspis, commonly known as the two-cusped milkweed, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its unique seed pods, known as follicles, contain toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Asclepias bicuspis plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
