    "intro": "Asemeia hebeclada var. impensa, commonly known as the Impensable Hebe, is a rare and unique variant of the Hebe genus native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue-green foliage that retains its color throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
