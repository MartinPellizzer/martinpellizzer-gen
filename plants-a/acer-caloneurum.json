    "intro": "Acer caloneurum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven segments, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer caloneurum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It thrives in temperate climates at high altitudes, often found in forests and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cool, moist environments and is commonly associated with subtropical and temperate forest ecosystems. It is also present in parts of northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caloneurum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in the United States and parts of Europe for its ornamental value. It is often planted as a shade tree due to its attractive foliage and tolerance to urban conditions. The distribution includes regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces, contributing to local biodiversity in non-native areas. However, its spread outside of cultivation is limited, and it is not considered invasive in most regions."
