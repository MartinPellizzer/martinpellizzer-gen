    "intro": "Agave americana foliis-variegatis, commonly known as the variegated agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. It produces tall flower stalks with yellow flowers, though it rarely blooms in cultivation. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and is popular in ornamental gardening."
