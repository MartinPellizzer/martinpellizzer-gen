    "intro": "Allionia bandurriae, commonly known as the Bandurria lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stem is slender and erect. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Allionia bandurriae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
