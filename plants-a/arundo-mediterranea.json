    "intro": "Arundo mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its strong, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Arundo mediterranea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making and thatching."
