    "intro": "Acrolasia gracilis, commonly known as the slender acrolasia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a subtle, aromatic scent. Acrolasia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
