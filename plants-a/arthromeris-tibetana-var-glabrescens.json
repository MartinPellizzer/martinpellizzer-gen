    "intro": "Arthromeris tibetana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Tibetan rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral morphology, with small, intricately structured flowers that are adapted to its harsh, alpine environment. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has developed mechanisms to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and low oxygen levels. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against intense solar radiation. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native habitat."
