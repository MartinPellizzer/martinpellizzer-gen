    "intro": "Agrostis panicoides, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Agrostis panicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
