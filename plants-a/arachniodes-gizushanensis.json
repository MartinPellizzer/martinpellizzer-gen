    "intro": "Arachniodes gizushanensis, commonly known as the Gizushan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with a pinnate arrangement of pinnae, which are often adorned with silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
