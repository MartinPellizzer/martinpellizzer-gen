    "intro": "Alexitoxicon intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate poison ivy. It is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. While it is not as toxic as true poison ivy, it can still cause mild skin irritation in some individuals."
