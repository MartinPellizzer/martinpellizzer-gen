    "intro": "Anathallis regalis, commonly known as the royal anathallis, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, primarily certain species of bees. Anathallis regalis is notable for its rarity and is considered a flagship species for the conservation of tropical orchids."
