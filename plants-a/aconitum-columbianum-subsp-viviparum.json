    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum subsp. viviparum, commonly known as the Columbia monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers and large, deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid-rich sap, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. This subspecies is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, where it produces live young through vegetative propagation.",
