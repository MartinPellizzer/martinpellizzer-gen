    "intro": "Alatiliparis bilobulata, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that exhibit a distinctive two-lobed structure at the base. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive system relies on spores, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss, Alatiliparis bilobulata is considered a rare and endangered species."
