    "intro": "Allium verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered onion or mountain garlic, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are often used in culinary applications, similar to other members of the Allium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and useful in both horticulture and gastronomy."
