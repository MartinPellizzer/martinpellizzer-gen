    "intro": "Austrobuxus montanus, commonly known as the mountain boxwood, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Austrobuxus montanus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and year-round foliage."
