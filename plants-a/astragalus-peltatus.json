    "intro": "Astragalus peltatus, commonly known as the peltate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, rounded base that gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, pod-like structure that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Astragalus peltatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
