    "intro": "Anemone hepatica var. minor, commonly known as the lesser hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring blooms of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and sometimes blue. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are typically heart-shaped, and it thrives in moist, woodland soils. It is often found in shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is noted for its early emergence in the spring. The lesser hepatica is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting early pollinators."
