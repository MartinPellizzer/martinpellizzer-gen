    "intro": "Aleurites angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and narrow elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in some regions. The species is also valued for its oil-rich seeds, which have been used in traditional medicine and industry."
