    "intro": "Arabis holboellii f. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs in the wild form. The glabrous form, however, lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth, hairless appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
