    "intro": "Asplenium nidus var. plicatum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a variant of the common bird's nest fern. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a basket-like structure, which provides a habitat for small animals and insects. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest floors. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular ornamental plant in indoor and outdoor gardens."
