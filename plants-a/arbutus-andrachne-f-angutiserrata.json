    "intro": "Arbutus andrachne f. angutiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bearberry, is a subspecies of the bearberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
