    "intro": "Aira wilhelmsii, commonly known as the bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a valuable groundcover. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other grasses like Poa and Festuca."
