    "intro": "Alsine scabra, commonly known as the rough alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has hairy, slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear, narrow, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. Alsine scabra is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained environments."
