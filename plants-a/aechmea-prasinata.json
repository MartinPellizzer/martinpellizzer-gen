    "intro": "Aechmea prasinata, commonly known as the green aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It produces vibrant, spathaceous flowers that are often pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in bright, indirect light."
