    "intro": "Azorella morenonis, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Azorella morenonis is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora."
