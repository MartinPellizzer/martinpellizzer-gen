    "intro": "Atalanta, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce berries that contain toxic compounds. Many species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The name \"Atalanta\" is derived from the Greek mythological figure, reflecting the plant's association with beauty and attraction."
