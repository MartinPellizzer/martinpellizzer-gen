    "intro": "Andersonia pinaster, commonly known as the Christmas Island hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
