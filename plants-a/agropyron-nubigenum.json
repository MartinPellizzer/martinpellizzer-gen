    "intro": "Agropyron nubigenum, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron nubigenum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is well-suited for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its resilience to harsh climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
