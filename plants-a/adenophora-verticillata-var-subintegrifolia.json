    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite or whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is distinguished by its more refined leaf shape compared to the typical form of Adenophora verticillata.",
