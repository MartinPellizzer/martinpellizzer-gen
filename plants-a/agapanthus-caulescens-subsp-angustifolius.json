It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, upright flower stalks that bear clusters of large, showy blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in the summer months."
