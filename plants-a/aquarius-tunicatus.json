    "intro": "Aquarius tunicatus, commonly known as the sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin, transparent skin that can change color for camouflage. The plant-like appearance of its body, which resembles a leaf, is a key feature that aids in its survival. It lacks a true shell and instead has a mantle that can secrete a protective layer. Aquarius tunicatus is found in tropical and temperate coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems through its feeding habits."
