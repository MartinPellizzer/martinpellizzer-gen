    "intro": "Althaea baldshuanica, commonly known as the Caucasian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Althaea baldshuanica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
