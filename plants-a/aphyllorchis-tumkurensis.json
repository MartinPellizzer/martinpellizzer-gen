    "intro": "Aphyllorchis tumkurensis, commonly known as the Tumkuru orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip. The plant is terrestrial, growing in moist, shaded forest environments, and has a short, fleshy rhizome. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
