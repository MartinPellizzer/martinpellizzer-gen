    "intro": "Agelaea woodii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fibrous bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a symbol of resilience in Hawaiian ecosystems. Agelaea woodii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
