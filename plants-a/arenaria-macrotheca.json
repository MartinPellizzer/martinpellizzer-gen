It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is native to regions with rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine or coastal areas. Arenaria macrotheca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
