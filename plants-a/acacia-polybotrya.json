    "intro": "Acacia polybotrya, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often silver-gray stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Acacia polybotrya is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water conservation. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This species is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It thrives in regions with a subtropical to temperate climate. The plant is well adapted to the local soil and climatic conditions of these areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polybotrya was mainly introduced to Jawa. It is a species of acacia that has been documented in the region, likely due to its ecological adaptability and potential uses. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It has been observed in both natural and disturbed habitats across Jawa. Its introduction may have been intentional for purposes such as land stabilization or ornamental use."
