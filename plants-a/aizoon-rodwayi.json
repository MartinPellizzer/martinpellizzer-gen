    "intro": "Aizoon rodwayi, commonly known as the rodway's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Aizoon rodwayi is also notable for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus."
