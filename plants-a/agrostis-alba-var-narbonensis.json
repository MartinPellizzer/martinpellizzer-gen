    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. narbonensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and coastal dunes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is noted for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
