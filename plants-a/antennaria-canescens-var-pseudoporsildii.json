    "intro": "Antennaria canescens var. pseudoporsildii, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in the absence of leaves. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, frost-prone climates. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
