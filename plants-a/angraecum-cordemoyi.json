It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white flowers with prominent violet markings. The plant produces its flowers at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators such as the hawkmoth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
