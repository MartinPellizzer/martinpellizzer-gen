    "intro": "Australina pusilla var. major, commonly known as the small-flowered australina, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
