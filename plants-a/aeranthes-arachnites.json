    "intro": "Aeranthes arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble legs. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a contrasting purple or red lip, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
