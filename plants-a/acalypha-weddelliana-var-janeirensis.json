This variant is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range. It is a shrub that plays a role in the ecological diversity of the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha weddelliana var. janeirensis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Brazil, particularly in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. It is commonly found in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in the tropical climate. This plant is often used for dune stabilization due to its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind. Its introduction has been part of ecological restoration efforts in the region. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
