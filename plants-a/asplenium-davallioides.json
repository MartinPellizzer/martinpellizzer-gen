    "intro": "Asplenium davallioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Asplenium davallioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."
