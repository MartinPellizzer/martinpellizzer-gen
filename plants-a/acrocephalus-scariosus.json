    "intro": "Acrocephalus scariosus, commonly known as the scarious marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in damp meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Acrocephalus scariosus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and provides habitat for various invertebrates.",
