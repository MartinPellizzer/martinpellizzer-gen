    "intro": "Alectoridia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in composite heads, similar to other members of the daisy family. Alectoridia species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in dry and sunny conditions. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical uses are not as well-documented as those of other Asteraceae plants."
