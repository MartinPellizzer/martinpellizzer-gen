    "intro": "Athanasia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance when touched. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. The sticky mallow is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
