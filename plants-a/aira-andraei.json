    "intro": "Aira andraei, commonly known as the slender false grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
