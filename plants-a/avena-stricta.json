    "intro": "Avena stricta, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its upright, slender growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Avena stricta is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in ecological restoration projects."
