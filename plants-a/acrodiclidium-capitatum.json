    "intro": "Acrodiclidium capitatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Acrodiclidium capitatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.",
