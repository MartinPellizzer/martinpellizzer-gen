It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and supports a variety of pollinators."
