    "intro": "Aeonium arboreum var. holochrysum, commonly known as the \"Golden Tree Aeonium,\" is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a tree-like structure with dense, fleshy rosettes of bright yellow to orange-green leaves that are covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
