    "intro": "Andrachne roemeriana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy soils, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Andrachne roemeriana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
