    "intro": "Alnus mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and typically have 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by spherical cones that release seeds in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The plant has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration efforts."
