    "intro": "Astragalus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its flowers change color as they mature, ranging from white to pink to purple, which is a unique trait among legumes. Astragalus mutabilis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
