    "intro": "Albizia carbonaria, commonly known as the black albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Albizia carbonaria has a shallow root system and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems. Its wood is lightweight and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including construction and fuel."
