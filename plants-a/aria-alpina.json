    "intro": "Aria alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aria alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in challenging mountain environments."
