    "intro": "Ampherephis psilocarpa, commonly known as the purple-spored bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Phallaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, saddle-shaped cap and a thick, fleshy stem that often has a purple or reddish hue. The fruiting bodies typically grow on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from a unique, sac-like structure called a gleba, which is enclosed within the cap. This species is notable for its ecological role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems."
