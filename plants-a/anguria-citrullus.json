    "intro": "Anguria citrullus, commonly known as watermelon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a sprawling annual vine that produces large, fleshy fruits with a high water content. The fruit has a green rind with a white, fibrous layer beneath, and a juicy, sweet red or pink flesh. The seeds are typically enclosed within the pulp and can be either edible or inedible depending on the variety. Botanically, it is characterized by its monoecious nature, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant."
