    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocalyx delavayi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It grows in humid, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is also occasionally reported in neighboring regions of northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalyx delavayi was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in the mountainous areas of southern China. It is often found in forested habitats, growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and parks in these regions. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of debate among botanists and ecologists."
