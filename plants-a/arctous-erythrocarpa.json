    "intro": "Arctous erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited arctous, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Arctous erythrocarpa is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and well-drained sandy soils."
