    "intro": "Athyrium sublineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
