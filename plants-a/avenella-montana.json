    "intro": "Avenella montana, commonly known as mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in the early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Avenella montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
