    "intro": "Andropogon polymorphus, commonly known as the variable grass or tall golden grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Andropogon polymorphus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
