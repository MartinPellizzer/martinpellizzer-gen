    "intro": "Atraphaxis billardierei var. tournefortii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
