It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the Rosaceae family.
