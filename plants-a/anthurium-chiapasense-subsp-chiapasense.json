It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble a spadix, often with a contrasting color. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
