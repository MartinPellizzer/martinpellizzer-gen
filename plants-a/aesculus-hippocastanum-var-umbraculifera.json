    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aesculus hippocastum var. umbraculifera, commonly known as the Umbra maple, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that provide dense shade, making it a popular ornamental tree. The plant produces showy, white spires of flowers in the spring, followed by red, spiny capsules containing glossy, horse chestnuts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to provide significant shade in urban and suburban landscapes."
