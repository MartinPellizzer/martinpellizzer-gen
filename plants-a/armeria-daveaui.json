    "intro": "Armeria daveaui, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Armeria daveaui is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
