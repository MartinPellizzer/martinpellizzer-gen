    "intro": "Aspasia silvana, commonly known as the mountain aspasia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Aspasia silvana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
