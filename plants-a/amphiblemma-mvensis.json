    "intro": "Amphiblemma mvensis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a short, underground rhizome system. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Amphiblemma mvensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
