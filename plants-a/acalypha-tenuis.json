    "intro": "Acalypha tenuis, commonly known as slenderleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed or cultivated areas as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its rapid establishment in new habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments. Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread in ecologically sensitive areas."
