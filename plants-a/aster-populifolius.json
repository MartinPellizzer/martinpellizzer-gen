It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Aster populifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
