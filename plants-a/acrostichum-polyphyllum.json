    "intro": "Acrostichum polyphyllum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental aquatic gardening.",
