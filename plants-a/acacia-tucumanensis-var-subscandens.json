    "intro": "Acacia tucumanensis var. subscandens, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates with poor soil conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tucumanensis var. subscandens is primarily native to Argentina, specifically in the provinces of San Juan and Tucum\u00e1n. This plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in regions with a semi-arid climate and well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with rocky or sandy soils in these areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tucumanensis var. subscandens was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in native forests and along coastal regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments have led to its classification as an environmental weed in some parts of the country. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem balance. Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological disruption."
