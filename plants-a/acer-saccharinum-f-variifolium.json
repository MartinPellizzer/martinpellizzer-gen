    "intro": "Acer saccharinum f. variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf silver maple, is a naturally occurring variant of the silver maple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that exhibit variations in shape and size, often with lobes that are more pronounced or differently arranged compared to the typical silver maple. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique foliage.",
