    "intro": "Asplenium pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and deeply lobed. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus. This fern is often found in association with other moisture-loving species in its native habitat."
