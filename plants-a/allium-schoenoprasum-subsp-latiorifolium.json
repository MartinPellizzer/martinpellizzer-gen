    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum subsp. latiorifolium, commonly known as broadleaf chives, is a subspecies of the chive plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical chives, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Allium genus. Its leaves are often used as a herb in cooking, similar to regular chives, but with a milder flavor. This subspecies is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
