    "intro": "Anthoxanthum puelii var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in xeriscaped gardens."
