    "intro": "Alchemilla aranica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Alchemilla aranica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
