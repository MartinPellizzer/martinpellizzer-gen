    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa f. lutea, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a variant of the common milkweed native to North America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
