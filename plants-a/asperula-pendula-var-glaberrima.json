    "intro": "Asperula pendula var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous weeping azalea, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
