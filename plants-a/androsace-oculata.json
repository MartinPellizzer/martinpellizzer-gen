    "intro": "Androsace oculata, commonly known as the eye-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Androsace oculata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
