    "intro": "Asclepiodora, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce fruits that are follicles containing seeds with silky appendages. Asclepiodora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in disturbed soils. They play a role in local ecosystems, though they are not widely cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
