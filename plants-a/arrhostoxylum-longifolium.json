    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved arrhostoxylum, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and elongated, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
