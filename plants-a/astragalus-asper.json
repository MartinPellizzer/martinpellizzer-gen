    "intro": "Astragalus asper, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in poor soils and dry climates. Its hairy leaves and robust root system make it a resilient species often found in steppe and desert environments."
