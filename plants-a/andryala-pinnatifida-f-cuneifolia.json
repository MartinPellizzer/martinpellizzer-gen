    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida f. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf andryala, is a variant of the Andryala pinnatifida species, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The f. cuneifolia form is distinguished by its more elongated and pointed leaf shape compared to the typical variety."
