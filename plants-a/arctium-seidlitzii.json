    "intro": "Arctium seidlitzii, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are purple and bloom in late summer."
