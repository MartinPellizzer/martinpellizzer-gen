    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer acuminatilobum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. This species is commonly associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests, growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer acuminatilobum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the eastern and central regions of the country. The plant has been cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for ecological or agricultural purposes. Despite its popularity, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is planted. Its distribution remains largely confined to human-modified environments rather than natural habitats."
