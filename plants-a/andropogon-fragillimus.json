    "intro": "Andropogon fragillimus, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, blue-green blades that are typically less than 10 inches tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valued plant in native grassland restoration projects."
