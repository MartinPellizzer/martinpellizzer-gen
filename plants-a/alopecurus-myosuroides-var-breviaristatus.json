    "intro": "Alopecurus myosuroides var. breviaristatus, commonly known as the short-awned mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its short awns distinguish it from other varieties within the species. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
