    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subf. tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically narrower and more elongated compared to other maple species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.",
