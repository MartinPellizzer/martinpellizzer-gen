It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall, providing ornamental value throughout the year. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rounded crown, making it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with serrated edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring. The species is relatively hardy, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.",
