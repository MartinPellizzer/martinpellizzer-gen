    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia f. concolor, commonly known as the purple wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a waxy texture and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom during the coldest months of the year."
