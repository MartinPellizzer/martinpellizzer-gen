    "intro": "Aeschynomene americana var. depila, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils such as agricultural fields and roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
