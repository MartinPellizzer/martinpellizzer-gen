    "intro": "Agave atrovirens var. sigmatophylla, commonly known as the black agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, thick, and fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale green flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and efficient water conservation."
