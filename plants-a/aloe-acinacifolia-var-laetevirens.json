    "intro": "Aloe acinacifolia var. laetevirens, commonly known as the sword aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
