    "intro": "Avena subspicata, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Avena subspicata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects."
