    "intro": "Astragalus brachypus, commonly known as the shortpod milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus brachypus has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat."
