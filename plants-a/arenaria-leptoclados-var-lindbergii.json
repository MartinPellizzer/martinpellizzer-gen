    "intro": "Arenaria leptoclados var. lindbergii, commonly known as Lindberg's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features wiry stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize exposure to strong winds and intense sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
