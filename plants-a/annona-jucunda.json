It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, pear-shaped fruits with a thick, waxy skin. The fruit contains a creamy, sweet pulp with numerous seeds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
