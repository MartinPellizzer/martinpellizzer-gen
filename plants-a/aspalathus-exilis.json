    "intro": "Aspalathus exilis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. It is closely related to the more famous rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but is less commonly cultivated. The botanical interest in Aspalathus exilis lies in its unique morphology and potential for future horticultural or commercial use."
