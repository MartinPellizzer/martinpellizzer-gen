It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center.

Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded. Amarella wislizeni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
