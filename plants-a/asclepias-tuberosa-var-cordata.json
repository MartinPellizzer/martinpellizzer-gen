It is characterized by its striking orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with hairy stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. This species is also important as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
