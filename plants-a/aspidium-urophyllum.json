    "intro": "Aspidium urophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into multiple segments. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded environments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
