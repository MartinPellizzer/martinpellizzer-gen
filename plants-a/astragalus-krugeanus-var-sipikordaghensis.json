It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers.

It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
