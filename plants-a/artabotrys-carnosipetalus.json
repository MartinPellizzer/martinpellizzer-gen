It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and has a woody stem covered in soft, hairy pubescence. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of branches, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Artabotrys carnosipetalus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
