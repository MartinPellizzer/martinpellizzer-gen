    "intro": "Aristida neesiana, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often bristled with short, stiff hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
