    "intro": "Aechmanthera, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their showy, often violet or purple flowers and hairy, silver-gray leaves. Aechmanthera species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds."
