    "intro": "Aspidium tripteris, commonly known as the three-finger fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into three main segments, giving it its common name. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor the plant in soil. Aspidium tripteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
