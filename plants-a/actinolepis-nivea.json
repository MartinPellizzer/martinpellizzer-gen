    "intro": "Actinolepis nivea, commonly known as the white-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. Actinolepis nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.",
