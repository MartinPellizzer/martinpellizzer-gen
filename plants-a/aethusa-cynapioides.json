    "intro": "Aethusa cynapioides, commonly known as cowbane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Cowbane is toxic to livestock and humans, making it a plant to avoid in natural settings."
