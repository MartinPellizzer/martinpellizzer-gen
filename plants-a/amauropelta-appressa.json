    "intro": "Amauropelta appressa, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the soil while supporting its delicate foliage. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
