    "intro": "Arabis inyoensis, commonly known as Inyo rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California and Nevada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
