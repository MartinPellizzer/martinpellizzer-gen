    "intro": "Angolluma miscella, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant produces spherical berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
