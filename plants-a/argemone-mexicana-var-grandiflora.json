    "intro": "Argemone mexicana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
