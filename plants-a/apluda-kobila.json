    "intro": "Apluda kobila, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers with six petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Apluda kobila is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
