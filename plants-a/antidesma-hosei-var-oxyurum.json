    "intro": "Antidesma hosei var. oxyurum, commonly known as the white antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
