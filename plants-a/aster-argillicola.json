    "intro": "Aster argillicola, commonly known as the clay aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces showy, purple to blue flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, adapted to its wetland environment. Aster argillicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
