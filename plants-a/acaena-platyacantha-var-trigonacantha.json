    "intro": "Acaena platyacantha var. trigonacantha, commonly known as the three-angled wood rose, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptation to the temperate climate of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. trigonacantha is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Chile and Argentina. This variant is commonly associated with the Andean foothills and coastal areas, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in dry to moist soils, growing in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant is known for its distinctive three-angled stems and small, spiny fruits. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. trigonacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact."
