    "intro": "Arum peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a contrasting lighter midrib. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which resembles a flower. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions. Arum peregrinum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil."
