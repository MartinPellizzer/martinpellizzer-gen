It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.
