    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bristle-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
