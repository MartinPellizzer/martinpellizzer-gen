    "intro": "Alstonia odontophora, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
