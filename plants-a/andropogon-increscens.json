    "intro": "Andropogon increscens, commonly known as black bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and dry prairies, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in native grassland ecosystems. Black bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control."
