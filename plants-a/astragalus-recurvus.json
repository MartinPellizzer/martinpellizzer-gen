    "intro": "Astragalus recurvus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, being curved and often hooked, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Astragalus recurvus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
