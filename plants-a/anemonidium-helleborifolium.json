It features a basal rosette of large, dark green, velvety leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in a terminal umbel. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
