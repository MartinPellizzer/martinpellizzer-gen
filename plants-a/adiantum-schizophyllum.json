    "intro": "Adiantum schizophyllum, commonly known as the split-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the delicate structure of a feather. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Adiantum schizophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.",
