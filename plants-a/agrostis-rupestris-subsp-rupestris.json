    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and mountainous regions. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and erosion control in rocky environments."
