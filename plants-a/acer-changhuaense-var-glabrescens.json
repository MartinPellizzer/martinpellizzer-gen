This variant of the Acer changhuaense is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and is commonly found in mixed forests. The plant is adapted to the cool and moist conditions typical of its native habitat. It is a relatively rare species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer changhuaense var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide adequate moisture and well-drained soils. It thrives in areas with mild winters and warm summers, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of East Asia and North America. This variety is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It has been introduced to botanical gardens and urban landscapes for its aesthetic value and adaptability. However, its natural range remains limited, and it is not commonly found in the wild."
