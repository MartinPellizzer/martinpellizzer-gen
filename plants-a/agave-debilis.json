    "intro": "Agave debilis, commonly known as the weak agave, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as bloom. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Agave debilis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
