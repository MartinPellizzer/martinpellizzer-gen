    "intro": "Alliaria spectabilis, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical, seed-containing pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in North America, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
