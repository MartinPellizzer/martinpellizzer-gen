    "intro": "Asparagus persicus, commonly known as Persian asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, succulent stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested before they fully develop. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Asparagus persicus is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its edible parts, which are commonly used in traditional cuisine."
