    "intro": "Acrostichum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf hawksbeard, is a small, perennial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Acrostichum pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.",
