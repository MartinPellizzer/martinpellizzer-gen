    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. minutifolium, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
