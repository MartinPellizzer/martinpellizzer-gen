    "intro": "Aphelexis, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. Aphelexis species are shrubs or small trees characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. They produce small, fig-like fruits that are typically green or yellow when mature. The genus is valued for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
