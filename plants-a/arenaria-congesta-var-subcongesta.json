    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. subcongesta, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited to rocky and sandy habitats, often found in dunes and coastal scrub environments. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
