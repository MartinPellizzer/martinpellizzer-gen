    "intro": "Athyrium subintegrum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, though this is more of a myth than a botanical fact."
