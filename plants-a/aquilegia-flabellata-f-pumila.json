It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in early summer. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
