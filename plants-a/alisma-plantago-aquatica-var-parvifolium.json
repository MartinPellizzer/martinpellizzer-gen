    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. parvifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It has slender, cylindrical stems that grow from rhizomes and are typically submerged or emergent in shallow water. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in the summer. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
