    "intro": "Appendicula longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-spurred appendicula, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations. Its unique feature is the elongated spur at the base of each flower, which serves as a nectar guide for pollinators. Appendicula longicalcarata is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
