It is characterized by its variability in leaf shape, which can range from narrow to broad, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Actinella heterophylla plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates.",
