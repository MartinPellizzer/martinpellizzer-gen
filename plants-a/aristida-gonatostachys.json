    "intro": "Aristida gonatostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically 3 to 5 inches long. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly plains. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
