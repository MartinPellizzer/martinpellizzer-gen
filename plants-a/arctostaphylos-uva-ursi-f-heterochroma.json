    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi f. heterochroma, commonly known as the variegated bearberry, is a variant of the bearberry plant characterized by its distinctive leaf coloration. This low-growing shrub features elliptic to ovate leaves that display a striking combination of green, white, and sometimes yellow variegation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shady landscapes."
