    "intro": "Astragalus mugliensis, commonly known as the Mugli's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus mugliensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
