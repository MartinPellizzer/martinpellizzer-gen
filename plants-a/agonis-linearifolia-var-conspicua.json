    "intro": "Agonis linearifolia var. conspicua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tallowwood, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in coastal and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
