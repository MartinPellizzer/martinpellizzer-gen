    "intro": "Aspidium caducum, commonly known as the delicate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium caducum thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest undergrowth."
