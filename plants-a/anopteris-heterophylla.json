It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from triangular to ovate, depending on the growth conditions. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often curved. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its adaptability to different light and soil conditions makes it a resilient and widely distributed species within its range."
