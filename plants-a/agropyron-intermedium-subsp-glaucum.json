    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium subsp. glaucum, commonly known as blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. This species is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
