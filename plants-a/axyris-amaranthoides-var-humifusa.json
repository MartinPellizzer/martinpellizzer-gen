    "intro": "Axyris amaranthoides var. humifusa, commonly known as the creeping amaranth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and other damp environments."
