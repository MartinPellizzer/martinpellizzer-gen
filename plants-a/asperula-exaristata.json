    "intro": "Asperula exaristata, commonly known as the mountain holly or evergreen holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it produces red berries that persist into winter. Asperula exaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
