It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble cherry leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The botanical features of Agelanthus prunifolius make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and ecological adaptation."
