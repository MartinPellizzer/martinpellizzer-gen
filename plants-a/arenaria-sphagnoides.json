    "intro": "Arenaria sphagnoides, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Arenaria sphagnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
