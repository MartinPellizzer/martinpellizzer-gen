It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are usually pink to red in hue, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Mallory manzanita is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
