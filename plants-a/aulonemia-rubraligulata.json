It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive red or reddish-brown midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.
