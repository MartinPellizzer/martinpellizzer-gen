    "intro": "Aloe agavifolia, commonly known as the desert aloe or narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its fleshy leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant."
