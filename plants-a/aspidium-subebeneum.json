    "intro": "Aspidium subebeneum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in soil while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium subebeneum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
