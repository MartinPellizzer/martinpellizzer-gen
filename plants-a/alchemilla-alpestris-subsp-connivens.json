    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris subsp. connivens, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
