    "intro": "Antennaria dimorpha, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Antennaria dimorpha is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
