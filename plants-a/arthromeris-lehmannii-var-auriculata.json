    "intro": "Arthromeris lehmannii var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with distinctive, fleshy, ribbed stems that often display a yellowish or reddish hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
