    "intro": "Actinidia umbelloides var. umbelloides, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a distinctive umbel-like arrangement of small white flowers in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are yellowish-green and turn red when ripe, though they are often bitter unless fully mature. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in moist, woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.",
