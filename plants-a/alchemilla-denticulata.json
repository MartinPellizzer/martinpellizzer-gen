    "intro": "Alchemilla denticulata, commonly known as the toothed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream sides. Alchemilla denticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
