    "intro": "Adenophora himalayana subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental requirements.",
