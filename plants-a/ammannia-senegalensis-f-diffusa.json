    "intro": "Ammannia senegalensis f. diffusa, commonly known as the swamp bladderwrack, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its unique morphology includes inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and water retention. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more diffuse growth habit and distinct floral arrangement."
