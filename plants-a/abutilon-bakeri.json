    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bakeri is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the northeastern coast of Africa. This unique plant thrives in the arid and semi-arid environments of Socotra, which is known for its distinct flora and fauna. It is commonly found in rocky areas and coastal regions, adapting to the island's harsh climate. The plant is part of the Malvaceae family and is well-suited to the specific ecological conditions of Socotra. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to the island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bakeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was primarily brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in moist, disturbed habitats. It is often found along stream banks and in shaded woodland edges. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
