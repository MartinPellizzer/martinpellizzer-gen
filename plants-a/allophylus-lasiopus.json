    "intro": "Allophylus lasiopus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a distinctive pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Allophylus lasiopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
