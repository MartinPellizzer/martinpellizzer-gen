    "intro": "Aesculus, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their palmately compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The fruit is a spiny capsule containing several chestnut-like seeds, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. Aesculus species are valued for their aesthetic appeal and are commonly planted in parks and gardens. They also have historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
