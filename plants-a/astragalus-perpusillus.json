    "intro": "Astragalus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually yellow or pale green, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus perpusillus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in difficult conditions."
