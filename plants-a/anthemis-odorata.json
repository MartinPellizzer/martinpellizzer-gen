It is characterized by its aromatic, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The essential oils extracted from its flowers are used in perfumery and traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
