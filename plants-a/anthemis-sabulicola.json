    "intro": "Anthemis sabulicola, commonly known as the sand daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Due to habitat loss and development, Anthemis sabulicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
