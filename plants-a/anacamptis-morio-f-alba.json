    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common marsh orchid. It is characterized by its pale white to almost translucent flowers, which contrast sharply with its greenish-yellow sepals and petals. This orchid typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces a single spike of 10\u201320 flowers, each with a distinctive spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in several European countries."
