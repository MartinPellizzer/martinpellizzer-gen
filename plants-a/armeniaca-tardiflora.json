    "intro": "Armeniaca tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering peach. It is a species of Prunus native to the Caucasus region, characterized by its deciduous nature and showy pink to white flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other peach varieties. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to peaches but typically smaller and more tart in flavor. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Armeniaca tardiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various soil types."
