    "intro": "Ambaiba bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ambaiba, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow, and are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional Indigenous medicine for their purported healing properties. Ambaiba bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
