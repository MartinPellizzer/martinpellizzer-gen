The plant thrives in the Mediterranean climate of the area. It is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils. Its distribution is limited to the coastal and mountainous areas of the Cape Provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis tetragona was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It has been observed in disturbed soils and along roadsides, often in areas with moderate to high sunlight exposure. The plant's introduction is likely due to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. It has shown adaptability to various soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland environments. However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment in these regions."
