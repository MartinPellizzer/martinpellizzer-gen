    "intro": "Alsophila melanopus, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dark, leathery sheath that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Alsophila melanopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
