    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis subsp. meonantha, commonly known as meadow bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective ground cover plant in shaded or partially shaded environments."
