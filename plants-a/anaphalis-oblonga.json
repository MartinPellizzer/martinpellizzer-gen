It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features dense, white, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and yellowish, arranged in a cluster that resembles a dandelion. Anaphalis oblonga is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
