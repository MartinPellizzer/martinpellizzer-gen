    "intro": "Agave gigantea, commonly known as the giant agave, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent perennial that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring a rosette of thick, spiky leaves that store water. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with white teeth along the edges, and they are covered in a powdery coating called bloom. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
