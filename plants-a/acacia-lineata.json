    "intro": "Acacia lineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a woody structure with a spreading habit. Acacia lineata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lineata is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria. This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia lineata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in these areas. Its distribution across these Australian states reflects its ability to survive in diverse ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lineata was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, its invasive potential in some regions requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
