    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. capitata, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and dense growth habit make it well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in meadows, alpine tundra, and rocky slopes at high elevations."
