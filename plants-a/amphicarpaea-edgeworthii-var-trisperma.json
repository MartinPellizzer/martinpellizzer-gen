    "intro": "Amphicarpaea edgeworthii var. trisperma, commonly known as the three-seeded burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its annual life cycle and unique botanical features, including its pubescent stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a trait known as amphicarpy. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to wetland and disturbed soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along riverbanks."
