It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Antimima hantamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals."
