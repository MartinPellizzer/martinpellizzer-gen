    "intro": "Artocarpus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces a unique fruit that changes color as it ripens, typically from green to yellow or orange. The fruit has a fibrous, starchy pulp that is used in various culinary applications. It also has a short lifespan, often dying after fruiting, which makes it a short-lived but ecologically significant species."
