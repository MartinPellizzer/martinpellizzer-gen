    "intro": "Aerangis biloba, commonly known as the Split-leaf Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically has a slender, vine-like stem that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Aerangis biloba is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
