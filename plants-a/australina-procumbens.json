    "intro": "Australina procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate australina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of Australia. It features wiry, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, adapting well to arid and coastal environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Australina procumbens is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
