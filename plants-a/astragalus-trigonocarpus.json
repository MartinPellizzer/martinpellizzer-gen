    "intro": "Astragalus trigonocarpus, commonly known as the three-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive three-lobed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus trigonocarpus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
