    "intro": "Astropanax evrardii, commonly known as the Madagascar giant aralia, is a rare and endangered plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant produces spores in spherical, yellowish structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Astropanax evrardii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
