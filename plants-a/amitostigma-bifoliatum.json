    "intro": "Amitostigma bifoliatum, commonly known as the two-leaved larkspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically divided into two lobes, giving it the species name \"bifoliatum.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
