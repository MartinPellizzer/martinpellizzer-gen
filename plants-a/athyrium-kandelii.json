    "intro": "Athyrium kandelii, commonly known as the Kandel's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium kandelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
