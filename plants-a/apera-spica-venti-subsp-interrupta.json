    "intro": "Apera spica-venti subsp. interrupta, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically wind-dispersed. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, greenish flowers in early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
