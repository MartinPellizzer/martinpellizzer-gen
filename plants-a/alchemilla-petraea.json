    "intro": "Alchemilla petraea, commonly known as the stone alchemist, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense mat of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla petraea is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
