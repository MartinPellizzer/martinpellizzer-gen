    "intro": "Anthurium nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest anthurium, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to shades of red and purple. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-based inflorescences that are typically surrounded by colorful spatula-like bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium nubicola is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
