It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and alpine regions. Agropyron edelbergii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
