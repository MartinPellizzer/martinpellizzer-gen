    "intro": "Alexandra imperatricis, commonly known as the imperial alexandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a robust root system adapted to the cold, rocky environments it inhabits. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
