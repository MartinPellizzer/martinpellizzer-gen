    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. nodosum, commonly known as nodose false oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. This variety is distinguished by its nodular structures on the stems, which give it its specific epithet \"nodosum.\""
