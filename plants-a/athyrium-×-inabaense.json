    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 inabaense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lace-like patterns on the undersides. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland areas and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
