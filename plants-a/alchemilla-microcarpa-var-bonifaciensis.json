    "intro": "Alchemilla microcarpa var. bonifaciensis, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with a soft, velvety texture due to its fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable plant for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
