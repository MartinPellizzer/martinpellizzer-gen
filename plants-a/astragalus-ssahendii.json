    "intro": "Astragalus ssahendii, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several oval, hard seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Astragalus ssahendii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
