    "intro": "Astragalus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, edible pods that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Astragalus multiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
