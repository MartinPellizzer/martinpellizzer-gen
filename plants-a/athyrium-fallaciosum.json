    "intro": "Athyrium fallaciosum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium fallaciosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
