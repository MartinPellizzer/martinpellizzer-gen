    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha strobilifera is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha strobilifera was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes. It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and hardiness. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems in certain areas."
