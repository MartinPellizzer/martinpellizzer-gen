    "intro": "Arachniodes jingdungensis, commonly known as the Jingdung fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, the species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
