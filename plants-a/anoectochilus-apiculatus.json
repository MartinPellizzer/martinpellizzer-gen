    "intro": "Anoectochilus apiculatus, commonly known as the apiculate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with flowers that are typically white or pale pink, featuring intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
