    "intro": "Alopecurus borealis, commonly known as northern hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Alopecurus borealis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
