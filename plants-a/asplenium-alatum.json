    "intro": "Asplenium alatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central rosette of fiddleheads. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Asplenium alatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
