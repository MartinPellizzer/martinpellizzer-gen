    "intro": "Allium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved onion, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, similar to garlic. Allium cordifolium is valued both for its culinary uses and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
