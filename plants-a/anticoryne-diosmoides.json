It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are tightly packed into a single, rounded inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.
