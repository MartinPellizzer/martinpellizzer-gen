    "intro": "Alchemilla macrochira, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, hairy, and often silver-tomentose leaves that are arranged in a distinctive shield-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla macrochira is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
