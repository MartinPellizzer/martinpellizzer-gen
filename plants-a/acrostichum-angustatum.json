    "intro": "Acrostichum angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf brake, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Acrostichum angustatum thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.",
