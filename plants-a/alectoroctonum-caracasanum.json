It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, golden-colored fronds that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and requires high humidity to thrive. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread slowly and form dense, lush foliage. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
