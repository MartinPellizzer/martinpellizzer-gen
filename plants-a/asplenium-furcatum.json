    "intro": "Asplenium furcatum, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium furcatum is characterized by its distinctive forked shape in the young fronds, which becomes less pronounced as the plant matures."
