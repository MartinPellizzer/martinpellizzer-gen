    "intro": "Arenaria radians, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. Arenaria radians thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
