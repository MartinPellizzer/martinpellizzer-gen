It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia.
