    "intro": "Ascyrum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered ascyrum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry capsule that contains several tiny seeds. Ascyrum pauciflorum is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
