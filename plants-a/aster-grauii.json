    "intro": "Aster grauii, commonly known as the Big Bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its bluish-green foliage and can grow up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces showy, purple or blue flower heads in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in prairie ecosystems and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Aster grauii plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in grassland habitats."
