    "intro": "Aegiphila languinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Aegiphila languinosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
