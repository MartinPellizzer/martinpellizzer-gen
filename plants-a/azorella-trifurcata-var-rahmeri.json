    "intro": "Azorella trifurcata var. rahmeri, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like structure composed of tightly packed, mat-forming foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh conditions such as strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often found in alpine and subantarctic habitats."
