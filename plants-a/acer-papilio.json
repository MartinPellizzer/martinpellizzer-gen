    "intro": "Acer papilio, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, with a spreading crown and delicate, branching structure. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens and landscapes.",
