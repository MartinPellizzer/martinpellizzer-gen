    "intro": "Altingia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed altingia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Altingia obovata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
