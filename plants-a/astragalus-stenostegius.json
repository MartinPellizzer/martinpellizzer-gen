It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. Astragalus stenostegius plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
