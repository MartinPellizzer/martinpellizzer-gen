    "intro": "Avena japonica, commonly known as Japanese oat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are often mistaken for grasses due to their appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy surface. Avena japonica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
