    "intro": "Asclepias asperula, commonly known as the green antelope horn, is a species of milkweed native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by seed pods containing toxic, milky sap. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias asperula is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and local ecosystems."
