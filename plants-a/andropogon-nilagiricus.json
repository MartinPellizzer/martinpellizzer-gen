    "intro": "Andropogon nilagiricus, commonly known as Nilagiri grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or on rocky slopes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
