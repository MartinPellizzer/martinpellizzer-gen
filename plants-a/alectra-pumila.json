    "intro": "Alectra pumila, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, rounded fruits that are dispersed by wind. Alectra pumila is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
