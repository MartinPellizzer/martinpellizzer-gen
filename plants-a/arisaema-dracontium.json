    "intro": "Arisaema dracontium, commonly known as the Indian turnip or Chinese arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spathes that enclose a spadix, a feature typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are often hidden within the spathe. Its underground tubers are edible when properly prepared, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation. Arisaema dracontium thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
