    "intro": "Aspidogyne umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy aspidogyne, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
