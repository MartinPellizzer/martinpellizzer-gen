    "intro": "Agrimonia vulgaris, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems, serrated leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Agrimony is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
