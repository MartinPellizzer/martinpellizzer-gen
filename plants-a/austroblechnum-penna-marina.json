    "intro": "Austroblechnum penna-marina, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along coastal areas and riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Austroblechnum penna-marina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
