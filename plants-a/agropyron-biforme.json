    "intro": "Agropyron biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Agropyron biforme is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects."
