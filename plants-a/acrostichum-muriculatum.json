    "intro": "Acrostichum muriculatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second.",
