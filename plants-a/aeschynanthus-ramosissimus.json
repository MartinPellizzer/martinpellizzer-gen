    "intro": "Aeschynanthus ramosissimus, commonly known as the flame flower or red-hot cat, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial shrub, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the showy flowers. Aeschynanthus ramosissimus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid conditions."
