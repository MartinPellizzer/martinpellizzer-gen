    "intro": "Alchemilla effusa, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla effusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
