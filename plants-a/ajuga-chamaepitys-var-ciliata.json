    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys var. ciliata, commonly known as the woolly ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are softly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
