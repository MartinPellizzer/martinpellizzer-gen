    "intro": "Astragalus impexus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. Astragalus impexus plays a role in soil stabilization and is a food source for various insects and small mammals."
