    "intro": "Alismorkis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and pond margins. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations. Alismorkis parviflora is valued for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
