    "intro": "Aloe ferox var. incurvata, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces long, branching inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is also valued for its gel, which has traditional uses in medicine and skincare."
