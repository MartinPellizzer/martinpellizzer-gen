    "intro": "Allophylus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
