    "intro": "Agropyron armenum, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Agropyron armenum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species often found in alpine and steppe habitats."
