    "intro": "Actinidia arguta var. arguta, commonly known as the hardy kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, inedible berries that turn from green to brown as they mature. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or espalier training. The fruit, while not typically eaten raw, can be used in jams and desserts after cooking.",
