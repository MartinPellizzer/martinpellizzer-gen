    "intro": "Aucuba filicauda var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dark green, glossy leaves with a distinctive, wavy margin and a broad, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to maintain an attractive shape with minimal pruning."
