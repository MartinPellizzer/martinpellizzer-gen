It features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces striking clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short, stout stems that rise from the leaf rosette, often reaching heights of 10\u201330 cm. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas.",
