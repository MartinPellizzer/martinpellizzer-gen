    "intro": "Anaphalis boissieri, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Anaphalis boissieri is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats."
