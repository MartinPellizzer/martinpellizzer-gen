    "intro": "Aeluropus repens, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Aeluropus repens plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
