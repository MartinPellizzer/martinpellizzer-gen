    "intro": "Allium guicciardii, commonly known as the Mexican garlic or Guicciardii onion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears umbels of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous structures, which are edible, have a strong garlic-like flavor and are used in traditional Mexican cuisine. Allium guicciardii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
