    "intro": "Acer tetramerum f. viridicarpum, commonly known as the Emerald Ash, is a rare variant of the green ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive bright green, almost yellowish, foliage that stands out against the typical gray-green of other ash species. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. This form is notable for its unique coloration, which is more intense than that of the typical green ash. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in eastern North America, where it thrives in partial to full shade.",
