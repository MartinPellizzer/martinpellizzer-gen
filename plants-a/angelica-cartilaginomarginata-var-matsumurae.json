    "intro": "Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in East Asia, particularly Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
