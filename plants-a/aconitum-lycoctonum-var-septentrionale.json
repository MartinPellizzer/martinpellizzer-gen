    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant has palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are dark green and resemble the foliage of a fern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
