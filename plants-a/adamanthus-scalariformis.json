    "intro": "Adamanthus scalariformis, commonly known as the scalloped sycamore, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the scalloped edges of its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Adamanthus scalariformis is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.",
