    "intro": "Acacia stuartiana, commonly known as the Stuart's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia stuartiana is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stuartiana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the inland areas of Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in shrublands and along riverbanks in these regions. Acacia stuartiana plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stuartiana was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns in non-native regions where it outcompetes local flora. It is commonly found in parts of Australia, South Africa, and the Mediterranean basin."
