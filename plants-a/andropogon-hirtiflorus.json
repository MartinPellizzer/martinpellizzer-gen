    "intro": "Andropogon hirtiflorus, commonly known as hairy-flowered grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with hairy bracts, which give it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale green to brownish in color and are wind-pollinated. Andropogon hirtiflorus is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and along streambanks."
