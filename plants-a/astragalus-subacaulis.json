    "intro": "Astragalus subacaulis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, typically arranged in clusters at the\u9876\u7aef of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. Astragalus subacaulis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
