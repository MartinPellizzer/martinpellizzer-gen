    "intro": "Achyronia pachyloba, commonly known as the thick-lobed achyronia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, sunny to partially shaded environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, which help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.",
