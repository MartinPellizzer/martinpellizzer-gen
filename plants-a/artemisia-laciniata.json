    "intro": "Artemisia laciniata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Artemisia laciniata is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
