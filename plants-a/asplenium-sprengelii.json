    "intro": "Asplenium sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant, often found on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium sprengelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
