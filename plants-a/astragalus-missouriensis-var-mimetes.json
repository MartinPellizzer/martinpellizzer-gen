    "intro": "Astragalus missouriensis var. mimetes, commonly known as the Missouri milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
