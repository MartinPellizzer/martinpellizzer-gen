    "intro": "Allium confragosum, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures called corms, which are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
