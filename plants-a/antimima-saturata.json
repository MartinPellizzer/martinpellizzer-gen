    "intro": "Antimima saturata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Antimima saturata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
