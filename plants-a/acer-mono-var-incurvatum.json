    "intro": "Acer mono var. incurvatum, commonly known as the twisted maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the winged maple. It is characterized by its unique, contorted growth habit, which gives it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, red to orange-red samaras, typical of the Acer genus, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a serrated margin. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity and distinctive form, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
