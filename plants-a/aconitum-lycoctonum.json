It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and it typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aconitum lycoctonum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution in handling.",
