    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. glaucescens, commonly known as blue bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, beige to brown flowers. It is characterized by its glaucous (waxy, bluish) appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
