    "intro": "Astyposanthes montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidensis orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often with a yellowish or reddish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
