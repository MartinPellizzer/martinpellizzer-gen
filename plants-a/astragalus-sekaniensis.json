It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus sekaniensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. It is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
