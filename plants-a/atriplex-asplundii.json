    "intro": "Atriplex asplundii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high sodium content. Atriplex asplundii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
