    "intro": "Astragalus rubromarginatus subsp. rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive red margins on the leaflets, which give it its common name."
