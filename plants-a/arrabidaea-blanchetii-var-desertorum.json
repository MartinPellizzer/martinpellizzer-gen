It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture to reduce water loss. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms."
