It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-tipped flowers that attract various pollinators. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias mazatlanensis is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle in its native habitat."
