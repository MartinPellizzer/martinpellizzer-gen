    "intro": "Aspidium aneitense, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Aspidium aneitense is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in dense forest understories."
