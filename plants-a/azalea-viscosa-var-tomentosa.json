It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and unique texture."
