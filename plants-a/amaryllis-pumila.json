    "intro": "Amaryllis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the winter months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its modest size and hardy nature. Amaryllis pumila thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
