    "intro": "Ageratum paniculatum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, fluffy blue or purple flower heads that resemble mist, which are borne on slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, white to light blue flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, giving it a delicate and ethereal appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators. Ageratum paniculatum is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
