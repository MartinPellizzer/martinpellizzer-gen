    "intro": "Andropogon albidus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-green hue, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
