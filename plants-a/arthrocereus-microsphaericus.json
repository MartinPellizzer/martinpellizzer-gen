    "intro": "Arthrocereus microsphaericus, commonly known as the miniature globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is a low-growing, leafless plant that produces clusters of small, spherical stems. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It blooms with yellow flowers that are typically nocturnal, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant in succulent collections."
