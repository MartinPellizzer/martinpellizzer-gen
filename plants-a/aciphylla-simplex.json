    "intro": "Aciphylla simplex, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in coastal and alpine environments, tolerating harsh conditions such as strong winds and salt spray. Aciphylla simplex plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.",
