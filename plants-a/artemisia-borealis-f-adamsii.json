    "intro": "Artemisia borealis f. adamsii, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in alpine or tundra environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and adaptability to cold climates."
