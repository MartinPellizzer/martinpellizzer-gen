    "intro": "Auricula-ursi deorum, commonly known as the bear's ear, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that resembles the ears of a bear, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
