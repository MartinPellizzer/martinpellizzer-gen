    "intro": "Agave vera-cruz, commonly known as blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height. Its primary use is in the production of tequila, as the core of the plant, called the pi\u00f1a, is used for distillation. Agave vera-cruz is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
