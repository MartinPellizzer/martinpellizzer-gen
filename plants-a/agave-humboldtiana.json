    "intro": "Agave humboldtiana, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a striking plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and large, fleshy leaves that form a rosette. The plant can grow up to 20 meters in height, making it one of the tallest agave species. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the plant, often after several decades."
