It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which eventually develop into small, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its aromatic leaves and roots have been used in traditional medicine and cooking for centuries."
