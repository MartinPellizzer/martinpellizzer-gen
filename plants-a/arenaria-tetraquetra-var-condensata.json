    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. condensata, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely packed leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize itself in loose, nutrient-poor substrates. This variety is notable for its resilience to cold and drought conditions."
