    "intro": "Anthriscus stocksiana, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for more toxic look-alikes, making accurate identification important for safety."
