It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in two rows, giving it its scientific name \"distichum,\" which means \"two rows.\" Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces white or pale green blooms. Aporum distichum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
