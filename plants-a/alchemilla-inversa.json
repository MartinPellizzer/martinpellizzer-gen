    "intro": "Alchemilla inversa, commonly known as the inverted lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are densely covered with glandular dots, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
