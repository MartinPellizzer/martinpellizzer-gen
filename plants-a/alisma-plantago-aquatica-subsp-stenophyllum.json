    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland habitats effectively."
