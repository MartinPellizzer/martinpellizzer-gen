    "intro": "Anabasis syriaca var. zoharyi, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
