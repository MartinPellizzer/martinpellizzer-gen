    "intro": "Archidendron harmsii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many areas."
