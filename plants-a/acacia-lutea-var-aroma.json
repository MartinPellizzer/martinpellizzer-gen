    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lutea var. aroma is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variant is commonly found in savannas and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the region, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lutea var. aroma was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Australia and New Zealand, where it has become naturalized. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Efforts to control its spread are ongoing, particularly in areas where it threatens native vegetation."
