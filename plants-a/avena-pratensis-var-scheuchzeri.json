    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. scheuchzeri, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with high-altitude conditions."
