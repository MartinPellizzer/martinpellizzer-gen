    "intro": "Agrostis beimushanica, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are small and spike-like, producing a light green to yellowish hue. Agrostis beimushanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
