    "intro": "Actinoseris arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Actinoseris arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and small animals.",
