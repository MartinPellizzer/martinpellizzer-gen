    "intro": "Anthemis triumfetti, commonly known as yellow chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for herbal teas and traditional remedies."
