    "intro": "Aglaia rugosa, commonly known as the rough aglaia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
