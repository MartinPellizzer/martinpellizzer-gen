    "intro": "Arachnorchis venusta, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns resembling spider webs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens due to its unique appearance."
