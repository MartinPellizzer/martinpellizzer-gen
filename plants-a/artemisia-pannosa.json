    "intro": "Artemisia pannosa, commonly known as the silky tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia pannosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
