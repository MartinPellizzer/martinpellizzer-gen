    "intro": "Asplenium theciferum var. theciferum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the Aspleniaceae family."
