    "intro": "Anarrhinum forskaohlii subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Anarrhinum forskaohlii subsp. pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
