It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are often used in livestock forage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and a deep root system. Agropyron thomsonii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
