    "intro": "Allantodia hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Island allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Japanese island of Hachijo-jima. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
