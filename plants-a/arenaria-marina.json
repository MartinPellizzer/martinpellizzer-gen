    "intro": "Arenaria marina, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in saline and arid conditions. Arenaria marina is well-suited to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
