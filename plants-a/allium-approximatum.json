    "intro": "Allium approximatum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbous structure is similar to other allium species, containing sulfur compounds that give it its distinctive garlic aroma. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
