    "intro": "Avenella flexuosa var. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender avenella, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils along the shoreline."
