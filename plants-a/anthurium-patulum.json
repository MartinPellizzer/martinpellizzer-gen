    "intro": "Anthurium patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium patulum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
