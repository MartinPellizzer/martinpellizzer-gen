    "intro": "Anthanotis pedicellata, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period from late spring to early autumn."
