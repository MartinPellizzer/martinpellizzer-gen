    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. vulgare, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It forms dense, low-growing mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form cohesive turf stands."
