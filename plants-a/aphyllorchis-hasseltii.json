    "intro": "Aphyllorchis hasseltii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, erect stem and a single, showy flower. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. This orchid is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
