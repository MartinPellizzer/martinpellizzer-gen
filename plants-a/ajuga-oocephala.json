    "intro": "Ajuga oocephala, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly toothed. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are arranged in spikes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a useful ground cover in shaded or woodland environments. Ajuga oocephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
