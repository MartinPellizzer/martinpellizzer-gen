    "intro": "Anoectochilus dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's toothed orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a distinctive toothed margin, and its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in high-altitude forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for the health of its fragile ecosystems."
