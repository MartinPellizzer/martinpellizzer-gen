    "intro": "Astragalus isopetalus, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, purple or pink flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astragalus isopetalus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local wildlife through its nectar and seed production."
