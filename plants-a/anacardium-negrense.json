    "intro": "Anacardium negrense, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or *castanha-do-brasil*, is a species of tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The tree produces an edible nut enclosed in a spiny, woody husk, similar to the structure of the cashew apple. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge, while the flowers are small and clustered. This plant is valued not only for its nutritious nuts but also for its ecological and economic importance in its native habitat."
