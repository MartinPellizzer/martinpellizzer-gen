    "intro": "Acacia pharangites, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular heads, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia pharangites is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pharangites is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the Nullarbor Plain and surrounding areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and inland shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia pharangites is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pharangites was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective choice for land rehabilitation efforts. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
