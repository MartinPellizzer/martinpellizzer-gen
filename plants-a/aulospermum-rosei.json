    "intro": "Aulospermum rosei, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, fleshy leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Aulospermum rosei is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
