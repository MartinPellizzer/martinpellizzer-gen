    "intro": "Atelophragma occidentale, commonly known as the western sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Atelophragma occidentale is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
