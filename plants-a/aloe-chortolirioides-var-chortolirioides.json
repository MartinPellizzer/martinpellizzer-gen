    "intro": "Aloe chortolirioides var. chortolirioides, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
