    "intro": "Angraecum globulosum, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, rounded inflorescence that resembles a globe, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
