    "intro": "Alchemilla verae, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose, upright inflorescences. Alchemilla verae thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
