It is native to regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces sweet, juicy fruits with a fuzzy skin, similar to the common peach but often with a more pronounced aroma. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and flowers that are typically white or light pink. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its edible fruit, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
