    "intro": "Adriana heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique and variable leaf morphology, which can range from lance-shaped to ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
