    "intro": "Acacia erythrocephala, commonly known as the red-headed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and distinctive, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, which are a notable feature. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices. Acacia erythrocephala is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia erythrocephala is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It is commonly found in savanna and rocky habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distinctive red seed pods and thorny structure make it easily identifiable in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia erythrocephala was mainly introduced to areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils, particularly in semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils where it forms dense thickets. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been associated with land degradation in some regions due to its aggressive growth. However, it also plays a role in providing habitat for native wildlife."
