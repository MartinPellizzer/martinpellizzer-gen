    "intro": "Aechmea fuerstenbergii, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and they are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom briefly before fading."
