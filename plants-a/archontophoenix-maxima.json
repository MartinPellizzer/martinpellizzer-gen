    "intro": "Archontophoenix maxima, commonly known as the Queen sago, is a cycad native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, which are typical of cycads. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
