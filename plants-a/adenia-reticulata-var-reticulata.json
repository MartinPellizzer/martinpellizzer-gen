    "intro": "Adenia reticulata var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined adenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree with a distinctive swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, adapted to arid environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a net-like venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, clustered in umbels, and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.",
