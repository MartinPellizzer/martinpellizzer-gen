    "intro": "Aleurites erraticus, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow or brown when mature. The seeds, encased in a hard shell, are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Aleurites erraticus is also valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
