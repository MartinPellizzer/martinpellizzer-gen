    "intro": "Arachnis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Arachnis has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly dependent on specific ecological conditions. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
