    "intro": "Aster argutus, commonly known as the rough blue aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open woods, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Aster argutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
