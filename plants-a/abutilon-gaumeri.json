    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon gaumeri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and dry slopes. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon gaumeri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
