It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pink or white in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
