    "intro": "Abarema diamantina, commonly known as the diamond fern, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in tropical regions. Abarema diamantina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.",
