    "intro": "Axonopus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants typically form dense, low-growing mats or carpets, often found in moist, shaded environments. Axonopus species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often used in landscaping for their ability to suppress weeds and form a lush, green ground cover."
