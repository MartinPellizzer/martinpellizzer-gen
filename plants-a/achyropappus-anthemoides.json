    "intro": "Achyropappus anthemoides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features simple, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.",
