    "intro": "Acrostichum recognitum, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Acrostichum recognitum make it an important component of wetland and forest ecosystems.",
