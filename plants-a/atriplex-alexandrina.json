    "intro": "Atriplex alexandrina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and poor soils. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds. Atriplex alexandrina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions."
