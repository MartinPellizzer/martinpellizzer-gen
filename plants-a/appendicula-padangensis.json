    "intro": "Appendicula padangensis, commonly known as the Padang appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Sumatra, Indonesia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting yellow or orange throat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
