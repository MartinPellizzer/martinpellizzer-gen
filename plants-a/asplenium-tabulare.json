    "intro": "Asplenium tabulare, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium tabulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
