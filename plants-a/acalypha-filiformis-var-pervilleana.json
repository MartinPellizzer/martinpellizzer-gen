    "intro": "Acalypha filiformis var. pervilleana, commonly known as the silky filbert, is a variant of the silky filiform acalypha, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its flowers.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and open forests. The species is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and southern Vietnam. Its native range extends into some regions of Oceania, including parts of New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha filiformis var. pervilleana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique leaf structure. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, its spread outside of cultivation is limited, and it is not considered invasive in most regions."
