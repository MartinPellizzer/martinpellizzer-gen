    "intro": "Aristida elatior, commonly known as the tall muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce feathery plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. The foliage is usually gray-green, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
