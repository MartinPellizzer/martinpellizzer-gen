    "intro": "Aster schistosus, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Aster schistosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
