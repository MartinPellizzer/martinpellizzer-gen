    "intro": "Aegiphila sessiliflora var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' aegiphila, is a rare shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
