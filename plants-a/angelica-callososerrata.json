    "intro": "Angelica callososerrata, commonly known as the rough-toothed angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that have serrated and hairy edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Angelica callososerrata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
