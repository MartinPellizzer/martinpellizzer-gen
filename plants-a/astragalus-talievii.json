    "intro": "Astragalus talievii, commonly known as the Taliev's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus talievii is often found in rocky slopes and sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
