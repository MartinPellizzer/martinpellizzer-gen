    "intro": "Apium pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble a lace pattern. Its taproot is typically small and not as developed as in cultivated carrots. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a source of seeds for birds."
