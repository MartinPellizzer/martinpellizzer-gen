    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. kulumyssiense, commonly known as the Kulumyssi fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
