    "intro": "Aristida glabrata, commonly known as the smooth beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Aristida glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
