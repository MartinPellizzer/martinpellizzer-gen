It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or loamy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock. Astrebla pectinata is also valued for its ability to regenerate after bushfires."
