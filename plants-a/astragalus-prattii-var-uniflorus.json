    "intro": "Astragalus prattii var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The species is characterized by its limited floral display, with only one flower per inflorescence, giving it its varietal name."
