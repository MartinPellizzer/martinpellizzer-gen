    "intro": "Anthurium tremulum, commonly known as the trembling anthurium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Anthurium tremulum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
