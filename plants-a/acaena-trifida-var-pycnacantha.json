This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas. It grows in a variety of habitats including forests, shrublands, and rocky soils. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. pycnacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecological balance."
