    "intro": "Aspidium muricatum var. incisum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The serrated margins of its leaves distinguish this variety from other members of the Aspidium genus."
