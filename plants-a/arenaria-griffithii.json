    "intro": "Arenaria griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria griffithii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
