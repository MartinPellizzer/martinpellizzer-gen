    "intro": "Aechmea rubrolilacina, commonly known as the pink-lavender bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers in shades of pink and lavender, which bloom for several months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating known as trichomes, which help in water absorption and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea rubrolilacina thrives in warm, humid environments and is popular as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
