    "intro": "Anodendron benthamianum, commonly known as the Benthams' anodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Anodendron benthamianum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
