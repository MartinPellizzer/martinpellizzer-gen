    "intro": "Aspalathus radiata, commonly known as the rooibos tea plant, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce the popular herbal tea known as rooibos. The plant's unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
