    "intro": "Astragalus noeanus, commonly known as the Negev milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus noeanus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
