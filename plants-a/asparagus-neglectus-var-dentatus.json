It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fern-like, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
