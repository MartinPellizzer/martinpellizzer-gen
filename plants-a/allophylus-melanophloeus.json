    "intro": "Allophylus melanophloeus, commonly known as the black-barked alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Allophylus melanophloeus is valued for its ornamental bark and its role in supporting local wildlife."
