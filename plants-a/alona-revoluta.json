    "intro": "Alona revoluta, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically floats on the surface of freshwater bodies, such as ponds and lakes, where it can thrive in still or slow-moving water. Alona revoluta produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by tiny, greenish fruits. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through its growth patterns."
