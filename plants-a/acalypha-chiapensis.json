    "intro": "Acalypha chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, berry-like structures that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Acalypha chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

This species is found in the southern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in humid lowland areas. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chiapensis was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates. It has been found in several states including Florida, Texas, and California. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
