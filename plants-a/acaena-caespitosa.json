    "intro": "Acaena caespitosa, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its spiny stems and small, lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, spherical, and covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena caespitosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.",

It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky slopes. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of southern South America. Its native distribution reflects its ecological significance in the region's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena caespitosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It has become a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts on local environments."
