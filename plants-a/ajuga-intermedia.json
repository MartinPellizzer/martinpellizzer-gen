    "intro": "Ajuga intermedia, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga intermedia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded garden settings."
