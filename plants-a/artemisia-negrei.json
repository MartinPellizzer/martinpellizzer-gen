    "intro": "Artemisia negrei, commonly known as the Negri sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used in traditional medicine. Artemisia negrei is also valued in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
