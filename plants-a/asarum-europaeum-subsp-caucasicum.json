    "intro": "Asarum europaeum subsp. caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian wild ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
