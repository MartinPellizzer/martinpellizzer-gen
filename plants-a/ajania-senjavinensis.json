    "intro": "Ajania senjavinensis, commonly known as the Senjavin's ajania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a compact inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
