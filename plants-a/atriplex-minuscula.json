    "intro": "Atriplex minuscula, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Ephedraceae family. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex minuscula also serves as a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
