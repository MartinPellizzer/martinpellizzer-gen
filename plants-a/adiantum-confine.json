    "intro": "Adiantum confine, commonly known as the narrow fern or the delicate maidenhair fern, is a member of the Adiantaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Adiantum confine is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
