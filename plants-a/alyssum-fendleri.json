    "intro": "Alyssum fendleri, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Alyssum fendleri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
