    "intro": "Auricula-ursi glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanists and gardeners interested in alpine flora."
