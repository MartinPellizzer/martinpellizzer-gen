It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces a spiny, globular fruit known as a cypsela, which contains the seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Anemonastrum polycarpum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments."
