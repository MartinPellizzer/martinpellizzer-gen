    "intro": "Allium setaceum, commonly known as the slender leek or sea garlic, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces upright stems that bear small, pale purple to white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Allium setaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to many garden settings."
