    "intro": "Arenaria galloprovincialis, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
