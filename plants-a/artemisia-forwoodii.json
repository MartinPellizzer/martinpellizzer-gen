    "intro": "Artemisia forwoodii, commonly known as Forwood's sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in small, spherical heads. Artemisia forwoodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas."
