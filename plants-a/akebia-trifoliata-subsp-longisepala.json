    "intro": "Akebia trifoliata subsp. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled trifoliate akebia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, edible berries in the fall. Its stems are covered with a thick, waxy coating that helps protect it from frost. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fruit."
