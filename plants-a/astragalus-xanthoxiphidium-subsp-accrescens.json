    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium subsp. accrescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellow to golden yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance in native plant communities."
