    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. dubia, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils. This variant is typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments."
