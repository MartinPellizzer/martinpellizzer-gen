It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are typically narrow and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
