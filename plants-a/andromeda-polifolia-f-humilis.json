    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia f. humilis, commonly known as the lowland wintergreen, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its evergreen nature and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils make it a valuable plant in woodland gardens. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
