    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax rehderianus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, where it grows in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in provinces such as Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often associated with forested areas. Its natural habitat includes rocky slopes and shaded undergrowth in mountainous terrain. It is an important species in the flora of these regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax rehderianus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions with mild winters and warm summers. It thrives in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and forest edges where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan, where it has been naturalized in some regions. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it is not typically considered invasive in its introduced range."
