    "intro": "Aspidium subelongatum, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a member of the family Athyriaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with elongated pinnae. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium subelongatum is characterized by its distinctive venation and is often found in temperate regions."
