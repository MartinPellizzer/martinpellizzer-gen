    "intro": "Arrhenatherum calderae, commonly known as Calder\u2019s feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces feathery, pale green to golden inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland margins and stream valleys. It is a low-growing plant, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, linear leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
