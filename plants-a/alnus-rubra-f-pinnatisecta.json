It is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in riparian zones. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and supporting diverse wildlife. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
