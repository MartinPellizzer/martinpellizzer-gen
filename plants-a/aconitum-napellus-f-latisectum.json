    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. latisectum, commonly known as the Broad-leaved Monkshood, is a hybrid variant of the European monkshood. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking purple to blue flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
