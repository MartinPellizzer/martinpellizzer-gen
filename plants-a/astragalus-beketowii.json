    "intro": "Astragalus beketowii, commonly known as the Bektowii milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
