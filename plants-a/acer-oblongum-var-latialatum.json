    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The broad-leaf maple thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
