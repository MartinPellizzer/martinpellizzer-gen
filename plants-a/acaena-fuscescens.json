It thrives in a variety of habitats within these areas, including grasslands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these regions. Its native range is limited to these specific areas in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fuscescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and central parts of New Zealand."
