    "intro": "Auriculardisia wilburiana, commonly known as the Wilbur's earviolet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive violet-colored flowers with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers bloom in early spring. It is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
