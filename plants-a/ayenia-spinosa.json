It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in arid regions of Argentina and Chile. Ayenia spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
