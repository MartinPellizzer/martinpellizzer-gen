It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
