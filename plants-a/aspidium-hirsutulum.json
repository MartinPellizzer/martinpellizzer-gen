    "intro": "Aspidium hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium hirsutulum is a hardy species that is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
