    "intro": "Alyssum degenianum, commonly known as the dwarf alyssum, is a low-growing flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Alyssum degenianum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
