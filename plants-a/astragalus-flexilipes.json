    "intro": "Astragalus flexilipes, commonly known as the flexible milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus flexilipes is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which benefits the surrounding ecosystem."
