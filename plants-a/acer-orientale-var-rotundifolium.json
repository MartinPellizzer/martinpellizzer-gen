It is characterized by its distinctive round or heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and seasonal changes.",
