    "intro": "Acrostichum borbonicum, commonly known as the Bourbon fern, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.",
