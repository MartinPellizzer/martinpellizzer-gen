    "intro": "Amyris zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits containing hard seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
