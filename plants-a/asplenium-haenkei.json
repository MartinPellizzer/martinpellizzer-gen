    "intro": "Asplenium haenkei, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features a rosette of lanceolate, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Asplenium haenkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
