    "intro": "Androsace laxmanniana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
