    "intro": "Aulonemia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Aulonemia pumila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
