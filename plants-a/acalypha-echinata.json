    "intro": "Acalypha echinata, commonly known as the spiked iron plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha echinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, long-lasting bracts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha echinata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is commonly found in countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand, and parts of East Africa. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with rainforests and wetlands. It is also present in some regions of the Caribbean and southern parts of the United States. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other areas outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha echinata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some native ecosystems. In certain areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local habitats. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers."
