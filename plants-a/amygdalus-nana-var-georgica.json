    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian dwarf almond, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Caucasus region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, almond-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
