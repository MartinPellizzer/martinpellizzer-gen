It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra bradeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
