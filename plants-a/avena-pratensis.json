    "intro": "Avena pratensis, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Timothy grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its use in livestock feed and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
