    "intro": "Asplenium pseudoserra, commonly known as the narrow-serrated spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns. Asplenium pseudoserra is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
