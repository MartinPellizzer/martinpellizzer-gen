It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum brachystachyum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
