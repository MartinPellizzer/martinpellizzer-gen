    "intro": "Alhagi turcorum, commonly known as the Turkish burr, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. Alhagi turcorum is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
