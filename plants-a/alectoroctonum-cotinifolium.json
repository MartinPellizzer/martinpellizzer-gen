    "intro": "Alectoroctonum cotinifolium, commonly known as the golden cotinus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically palmately lobed, with a distinctive golden hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, velvety berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and persistent fruiting."
