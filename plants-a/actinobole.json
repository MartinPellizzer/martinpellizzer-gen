It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like, blade-shaped leaves. The plant has a rhizome system that anchors it to the seabed and allows for nutrient absorption. Actinobole thrives in brackish water environments, often growing in dense underwater meadows. Its structure supports a variety of marine life, making it an ecologically significant species in coastal ecosystems."
