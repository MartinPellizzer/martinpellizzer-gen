    "intro": "Anathallis humilis, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to South America. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. It has a short, wiry stem and lacks leaves, relying on its roots for nutrient absorption. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
