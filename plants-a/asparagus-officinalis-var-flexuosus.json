    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. flexuosus, commonly known as the curled asparagus or the silver asparagus, is a perennial plant characterized by its unique, twisted, and often silver-tinged foliage. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is native to southern Europe and northern Africa. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, green spears that are harvested in the spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive, arching leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
