    "intro": "Asclepias rostrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, horn-like structure at the base of each flower. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and contains toxic sap that deters herbivores. Asclepias rostrata thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
