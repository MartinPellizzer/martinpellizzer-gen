    "intro": "Arnanthus, commonly known as the flame flower or red root, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that range from red to pink and yellow. Arnanthus species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are arranged in clusters or spikes. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
