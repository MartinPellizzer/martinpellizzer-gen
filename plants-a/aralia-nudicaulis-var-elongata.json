It features compound leaves with elongated, slender leaflets that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and has a clumping growth habit. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
