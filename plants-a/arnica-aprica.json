    "intro": "Arnica aprica, commonly known as the alpine tawnpuff, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Arnica aprica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
