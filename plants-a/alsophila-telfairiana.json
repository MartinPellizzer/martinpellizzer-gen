    "intro": "Alsophila telfairiana, commonly known as the Telfair's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean, including parts of Jamaica and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Alsophila telfairiana plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy structure."
