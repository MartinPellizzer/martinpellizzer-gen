    "intro": "Ambaiba tenoreana, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a rare and unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and long, spirally arranged branches. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study."
