    "intro": "Aspalathus teres subsp. thodei, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but differs in leaf shape and size. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its relative but holds potential for future horticultural and commercial use."
