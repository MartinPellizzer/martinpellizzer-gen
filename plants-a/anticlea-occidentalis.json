    "intro": "Anticlea occidentalis, commonly known as the western antclea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Anticlea occidentalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
