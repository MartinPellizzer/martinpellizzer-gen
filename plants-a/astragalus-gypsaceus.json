It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or sandy substrates, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus gypsaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
