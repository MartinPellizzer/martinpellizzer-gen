    "intro": "Aloysia virgata var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved verbena, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
