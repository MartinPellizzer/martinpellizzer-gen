It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla psilopodia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
