It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The white varietal name refers to the pale color of its flowers, distinguishing it from other varieties of Astragalus dispermus."
