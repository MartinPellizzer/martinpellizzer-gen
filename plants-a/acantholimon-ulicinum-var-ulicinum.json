    "intro": "Acantholimon ulicinum var. ulicinum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime chaparral habitats. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in open habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon ulicinum var. ulicinum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically spread through wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is often considered an invasive species in regions where it is not native. Its distribution is closely linked to human activities such as land development and transportation corridors."
