    "intro": "Aristolochia maranonensis, commonly known as the Maranon Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, typically green or brown in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. This species is valued in traditional medicine but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
