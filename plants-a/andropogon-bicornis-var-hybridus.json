    "intro": "Andropogon bicornis var. hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
