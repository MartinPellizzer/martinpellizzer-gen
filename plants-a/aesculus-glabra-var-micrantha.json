It features palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by spiny, bladder-like fruits containing one to three seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and distinctive foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
