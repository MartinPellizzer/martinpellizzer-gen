    "intro": "Andropogon fulvus, commonly known as golden bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and golden-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open fields and prairies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in grassland ecosystems. Andropogon fulvus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
