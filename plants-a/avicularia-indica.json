    "intro": "Avicularia indica, commonly known as the Indian sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and long, flexible tentacles. The polypoid structure of Avicularia indica allows it to capture prey using its nematocysts, which are specialized stinging cells. It typically inhabits coral reefs and rocky substrates, where it attaches itself to surfaces. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for smaller organisms."
