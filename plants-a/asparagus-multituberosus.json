It is characterized by its underground tubers, which are the primary storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces erect, branched stems with small, needle-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
