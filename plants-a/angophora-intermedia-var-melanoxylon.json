    "intro": "Angophora intermedia var. melanoxylon, commonly known as blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic timber, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a rough texture with a prominent midrib. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests."
