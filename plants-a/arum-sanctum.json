    "intro": "Arum sanctum, commonly known as the sacred arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its flowers, while not showy, play a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to its cultural significance and medicinal uses, Arum sanctum holds a special place in the flora of its native habitats."
