    "intro": "Aspidium melanopodon, commonly known as the black-stem fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Aspidium melanopodon thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
