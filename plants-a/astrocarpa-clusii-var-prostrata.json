    "intro": "Astrocarpa clusii var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate astrocarpa, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
