    "intro": "Apios martini, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are rich in starch. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tubers, while not typically eaten, are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
