    "intro": "Adromischus alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is relatively easy to care for, though it requires minimal water to prevent root rot.",
