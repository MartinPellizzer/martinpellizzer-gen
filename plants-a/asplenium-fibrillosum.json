    "intro": "Asplenium fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, which contributes to its common name. Asplenium fibrillosum is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures called sori, which are arranged in lines along the undersides of its leaves."
