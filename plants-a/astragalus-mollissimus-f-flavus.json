    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus f. flavus, commonly known as the yellow hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
