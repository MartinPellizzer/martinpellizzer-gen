    "intro": "Andromeda pulverulenta var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for erosion control and as a groundcover in shaded landscapes."
