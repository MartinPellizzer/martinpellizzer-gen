    "intro": "Anemone alpina subsp. millefoliata, commonly known as the Alpine Avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
