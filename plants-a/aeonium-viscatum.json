    "intro": "Aeonium viscatum, commonly known as the woolly aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in a rosette form, with leaves that can range in color from green to blue-green. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Aeonium viscatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
