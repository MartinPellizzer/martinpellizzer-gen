    "intro": "Athamanta tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted athamanta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique growth form and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
