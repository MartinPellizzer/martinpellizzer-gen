    "intro": "Austroblechnum lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's water fern, is a species of fern native to southern South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
