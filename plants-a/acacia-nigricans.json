    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nigricans is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Acacia nigricans is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nigricans was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms have contributed to its establishment in natural ecosystems. While it provides habitat for native insects, its invasive potential remains a concern for land managers. Monitoring its distribution and impact is essential for effective ecological management."
