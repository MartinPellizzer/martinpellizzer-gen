    "intro": "Artemisia wrightii, commonly known as silverleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. Artemisia wrightii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its aromatic oils contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
