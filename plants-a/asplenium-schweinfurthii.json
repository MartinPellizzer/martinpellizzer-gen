It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium schweinfurthii is a hardy species that is well adapted to humid conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
