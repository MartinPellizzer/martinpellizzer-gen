    "intro": "Alnus viridis subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are often smooth on the upper surface. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a dark brown color, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
