    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia, commonly known as wolf's bane, is a striking perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred petals and has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Aconitum vulparia contains potent toxins, including alkaloids like aconitine, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and requires careful handling.",
