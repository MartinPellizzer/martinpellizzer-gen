    "intro": "Asclepias rectinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure at the base. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is toxic to many animals. Asclepias rectinervis serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
