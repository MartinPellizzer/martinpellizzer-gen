    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis subsp. nitens, commonly known as the saltbush or lamb's lettuce, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of edible leaves in certain cuisines."
