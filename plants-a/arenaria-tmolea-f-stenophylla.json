    "intro": "Arenaria tmolea f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its arid or rocky habitats. It is native to regions of western North America, including parts of California and Oregon. This subspecies is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and open woodland environments."
