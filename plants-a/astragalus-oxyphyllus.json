    "intro": "Astragalus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are compound and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astragalus oxyphyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
