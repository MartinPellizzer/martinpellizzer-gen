    "intro": "Asplenium foresiacum subvar. paucilobatum, commonly known as the few-lobed rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
