    "intro": "Amsonia longiflora var. longiflora, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its showy, blue-gray flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it a mist-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery-blue hue, especially when backlit. It is well-suited for moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
