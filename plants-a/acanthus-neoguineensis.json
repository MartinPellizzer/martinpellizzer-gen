    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus neoguineensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. Its native distribution is largely confined to the islands of New Guinea and surrounding archipelagos.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus neoguineensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and floral displays. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments. Its introduction has been largely confined to regions with a warm climate, where it can grow year-round. However, it is not typically considered invasive in its introduced range."
