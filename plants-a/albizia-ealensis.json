    "intro": "Albizia ealensis, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a leguminous plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Albizia ealensis is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and dry environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
