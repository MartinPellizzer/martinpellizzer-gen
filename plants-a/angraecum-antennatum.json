    "intro": "Angraecum antennatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender, white petals and a distinctive, narrow, spurred lip that resembles a star. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom during the winter months, often at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
