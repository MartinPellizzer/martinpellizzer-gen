    "intro": "Althaea oppenheimii, commonly known as the Persian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Althaea oppenheimii is valued for its mucilaginous properties, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural emollient."
