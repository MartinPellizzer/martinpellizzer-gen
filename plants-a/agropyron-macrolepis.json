    "intro": "Agropyron macrolepis, commonly known as the long-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, blue-green in color, and have a rough, hairy texture. Agropyron macrolepis is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and soil stabilizing properties."
