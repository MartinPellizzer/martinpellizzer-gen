    "intro": "Arctium bardana, commonly known as greater burdock, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in a composite head, which is typical of the daisy family. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
