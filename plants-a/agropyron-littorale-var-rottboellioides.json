    "intro": "Agropyron littorale var. rottboellioides, commonly known as the coastal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
