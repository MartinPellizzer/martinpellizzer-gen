    "intro": "Adiantum ciliatum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique, curling fronds give it a graceful appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Adiantum ciliatum is also noted for its subtle, sweet fragrance, especially when the fronds are touched or bruised.",
