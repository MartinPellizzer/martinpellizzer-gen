It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, needle-like pods that contain small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
