It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience in harsh environments."
