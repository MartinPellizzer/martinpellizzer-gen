    "intro": "Acroceras diffusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often forming a dense mat on the ground. Acroceras diffusum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.",
