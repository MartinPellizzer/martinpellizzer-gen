    "intro": "Avena pubescens subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
