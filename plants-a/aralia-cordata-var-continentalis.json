    "intro": "Aralia cordata var. continentalis, commonly known as the European giant aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features compound leaves that are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. This variety is hardier than the standard aralia and is well-suited for colder climates."
