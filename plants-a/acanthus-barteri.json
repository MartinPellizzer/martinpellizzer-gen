    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus barteri is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, dry woodlands, and along riverbanks in these areas. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or limestone habitats. It is a hardy plant that can withstand periods of drought. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus barteri was mainly introduced to the region of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient to drought. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
