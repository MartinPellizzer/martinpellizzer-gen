    "intro": "Angelica laurentiana, commonly known as the Canadian angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Angelica laurentiana thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
