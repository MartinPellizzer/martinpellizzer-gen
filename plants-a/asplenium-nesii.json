    "intro": "Asplenium nesii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Madeira. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are small, round structures located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium nesii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
