    "intro": "Acourtia aspera, commonly known as the rough acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Acourtia aspera is often found in coastal and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.",
