    "intro": "Alexitoxicon albidum, commonly known as the white toxic vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids in its leaves and roots, which have been used traditionally by indigenous communities for medicinal and ritual purposes. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems. Due to its toxic properties, handling the plant requires caution and proper protective measures."
