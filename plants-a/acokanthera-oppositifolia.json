    "intro": "Acokanthera oppositifolia, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant is notable for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for poisoning arrows. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain seeds, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in cultivation but remains an important species in ecological and medicinal studies.",
