    "intro": "Asplenium monanthemum var. menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form."
