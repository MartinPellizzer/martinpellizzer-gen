    "intro": "Aspidium remotum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
