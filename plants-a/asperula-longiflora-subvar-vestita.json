    "intro": "Asperula longiflora subvar. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered woodruff, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its \"vestita\" designation, meaning \"dressed\" in Latin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
