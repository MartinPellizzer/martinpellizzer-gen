    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria subsp. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's arum, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence that is often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces a toxic sap containing calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
