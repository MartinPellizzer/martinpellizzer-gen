    "intro": "Athyrium contingens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium contingens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
