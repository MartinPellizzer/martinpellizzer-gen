It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive, long, parallel veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are often divided into multiple segments, creating a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
