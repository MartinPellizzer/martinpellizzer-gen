    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa lusus rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, irregular bark and small, simple leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
