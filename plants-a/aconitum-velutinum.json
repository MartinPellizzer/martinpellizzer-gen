    "intro": "Aconitum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety down, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
