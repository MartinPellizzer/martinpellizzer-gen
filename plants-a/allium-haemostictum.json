The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, lavender to purple flowers. Its bulbs are similar to garlic in appearance but are generally smaller and have a milder flavor. Allium haemostictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
