    "intro": "Aristolochia adiastola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or brownish color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, twisting growth habit. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
