    "intro": "Anthurium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the small, clustered flowers. Anthurium cubense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
