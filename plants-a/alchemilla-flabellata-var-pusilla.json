    "intro": "Alchemilla flabellata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture."
