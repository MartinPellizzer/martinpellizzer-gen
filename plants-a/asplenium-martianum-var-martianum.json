    "intro": "Asplenium martianum var. martianum, commonly known as the Martian spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its unique adaptations to the humid, coastal climate of its native habitat."
