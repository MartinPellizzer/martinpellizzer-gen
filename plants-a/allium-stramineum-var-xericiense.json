It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes."
