    "intro": "Alyssum campestre subsp. strigosum, commonly known as sticky alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
