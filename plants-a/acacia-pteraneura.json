    "intro": "Acacia pteraneura, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, needle-like phyllodes. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia pteraneura is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for landscaping in dry regions. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pteraneura is primarily native to the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the harsh climatic conditions of the Australian interior.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pteraneura was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in degraded lands. It has also been introduced as a source of browse for livestock in some parts of Australia. However, its invasive potential in certain environments requires careful management."
