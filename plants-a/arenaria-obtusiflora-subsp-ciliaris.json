    "intro": "Arenaria obtusiflora subsp. ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
