    "intro": "Acer italum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough, textured surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.",
