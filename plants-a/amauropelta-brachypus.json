    "intro": "Amauropelta brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, thick rhizomes that help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Amauropelta brachypus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest understories."
