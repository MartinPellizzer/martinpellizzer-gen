    "intro": "Astragalus decumbens var. crispatus, commonly known as the crinkled milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sprawling habit and hairy, often crinkled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in arid regions."
