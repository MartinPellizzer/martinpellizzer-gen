    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. opulentis, commonly known as the opulent bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a turfgrass."
