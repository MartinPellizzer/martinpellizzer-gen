    "intro": "Astrotricha obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental foliage and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
