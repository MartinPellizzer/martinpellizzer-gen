    "intro": "Artanthe stupposa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Artanthe stupposa is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions."
