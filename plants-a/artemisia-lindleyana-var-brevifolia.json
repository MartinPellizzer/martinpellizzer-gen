    "intro": "Artemisia lindleyana var. brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are clustered in loose, branching inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
