    "intro": "Astragalus caspicus, commonly known as the Caspian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus caspicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
