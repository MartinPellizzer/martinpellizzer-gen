    "intro": "Arundinaria wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's bamboo, is a species of grass native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Arundinaria wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and structural form."
