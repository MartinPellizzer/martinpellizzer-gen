    "intro": "Angelica maculata, commonly known as spotted angelica, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, hollow stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive reddish or purplish spotting. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly sweet scent. Angelica maculata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
