    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the barren sea spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern species. It is typically found in coastal areas, growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded environments. This variety is characterized by its reduced foliage and simplified fronds compared to the typical form of *Asplenium marinum*. Its small, delicate leaves are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh maritime conditions, making it a unique example of coastal flora."
