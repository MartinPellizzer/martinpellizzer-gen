    "intro": "Amanoa stenonia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved amanoa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
