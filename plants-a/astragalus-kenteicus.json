    "intro": "Astragalus kenteicus, commonly known as the Kente milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, which contributes to its resilience in harsh climates. Astragalus kenteicus also plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation, supporting the growth of other plant species in its habitat."
