    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 dualis, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arctium lappa and Arctium tomentosum. It is a biennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of purple to brown flowers in its second year, which are followed by spiny, burr-like seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can cause severe skin irritation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
