It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in fragmented habitats. Astragalus barbarae is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
