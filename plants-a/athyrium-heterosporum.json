    "intro": "Athyrium heterosporum, commonly known as the heterosporous lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clump-forming habit. The plant produces two types of spores\u2014megaspores and microspores\u2014on separate sporangia, a feature that distinguishes it from many other ferns. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance. Athyrium heterosporum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and stream banks."
