    "intro": "Acrosorus nudicarpus, commonly known as the naked fruit fern, is a unique member of the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its sterile fronds that lack the typical spore-bearing structures found in other ferns. The plant produces a specialized structure called a sporangium, which is borne on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's distinctive appearance and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
