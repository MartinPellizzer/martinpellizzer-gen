    "intro": "Acaena microphylla f. longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed burrseed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.",

This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed sites and open vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla f. longiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the 19th century. The plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It has become naturalized in many parts of the country, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
