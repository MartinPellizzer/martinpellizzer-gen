    "intro": "Agyneia impuber, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agyneia impuber is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
