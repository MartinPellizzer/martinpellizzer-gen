    "intro": "Aldama incana, commonly known as the hairy aldama, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Aldama incana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
