    "intro": "Acacia aurita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or whitish underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. Acacia aurita is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil rehabilitation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aurita is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in savanna and woodland habitats. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is also cultivated in some areas for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aurita was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, often for erosion control and as an ornamental plant. It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and moderate rainfall. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
