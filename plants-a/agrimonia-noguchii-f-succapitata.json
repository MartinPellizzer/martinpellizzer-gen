    "intro": "Agrimonia noguchii f. succapitata, commonly known as the Japanese agrimony, is a rare and compact variant of the agrimony plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
