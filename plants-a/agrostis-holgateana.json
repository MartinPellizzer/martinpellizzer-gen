    "intro": "Agrostis holgateana, commonly known as Holgate's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
