    "intro": "Arthrocereus densiaculeatus, commonly known as the dense-bristled cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered with dense, white bristles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant's adaptations, including its spines and nocturnal blooming, reflect its evolutionary response to its harsh desert habitat."
