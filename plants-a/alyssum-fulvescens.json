    "intro": "Alyssum fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow alyssum, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum fulvescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
