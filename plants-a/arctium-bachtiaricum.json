    "intro": "Arctium bachtiaricum, commonly known as the Afghan burdock, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. Its fruits are spiky, bur-like structures that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium bachtiaricum is often found in dry grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
