    "intro": "Atropa aspera, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its dark purple, bell-shaped flowers and glossy, oval-shaped berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant contains potent alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which are responsible for its toxic properties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along roadsides. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered a dangerous plant and is not recommended for cultivation without proper precautions."
