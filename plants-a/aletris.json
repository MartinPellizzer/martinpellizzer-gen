    "intro": "Aletris, commonly known as sweet flag, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Aletris farinosa, which is native to the eastern United States. These plants are herbaceous perennials that typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Aletris species have grass-like leaves and produce small, white or greenish flowers in clusters. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
