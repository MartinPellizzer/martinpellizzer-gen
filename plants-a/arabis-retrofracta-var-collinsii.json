    "intro": "Arabis retrofracta var. collinsii, commonly known as Collins' rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release seeds. The leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and have a rough, textured surface."
