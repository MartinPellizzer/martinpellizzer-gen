    "intro": "Acroclinium, commonly known as the nightshade orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Acroclinium species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plants typically have slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves, and they are often found growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to their ornamental value, some species of Acroclinium are cultivated in gardens, although they are generally not widely commercialized."
