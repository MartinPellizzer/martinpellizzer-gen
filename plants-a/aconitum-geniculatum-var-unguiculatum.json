    "intro": "Aconitum geniculatum var. unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem with palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
