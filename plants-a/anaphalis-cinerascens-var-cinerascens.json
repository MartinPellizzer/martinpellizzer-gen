    "intro": "Anaphalis cinerascens var. cinerascens, commonly known as the gray hair grass or silver frost plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms, which are typically borne on slender, ascending stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical gardens and ecological studies."
