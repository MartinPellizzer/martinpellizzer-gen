    "intro": "Asplenium ambrense, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. It has a compact, rosette-like growth form with closely packed, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly serrated. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium ambrense is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
