    "intro": "Acacia browniana var. obscura, commonly known as the dark obscura acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain flat, rectangular seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in degraded landscapes.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the area around the Geraldton region. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands within its distribution area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia browniana var. obscura was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of acacia species for ornamental and agricultural purposes. This variety is known for its unique dark foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant. However, it has also raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its distribution is now limited to specific regions where it has been intentionally planted."
