    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa var. ferruginea, commonly known as the red spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its reddish-brown glumes and awns, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
