    "intro": "Aberia hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender-fruited aberia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia hebecarpa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of North and South Carolina. It thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune habitats and other coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Its distribution is largely limited to the eastern coastal plain of the United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia hebecarpa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption."
