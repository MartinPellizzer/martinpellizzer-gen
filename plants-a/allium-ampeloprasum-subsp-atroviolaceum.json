    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum subsp. atroviolaceum, commonly known as the purple-leaved onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, purple-tinged leaves that are often used in cooking for their mild, onion-like flavor. The plant produces umbels of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
