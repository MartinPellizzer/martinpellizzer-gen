    "intro": "Apicra atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green leaves with prominent black veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming during the rainy season. Apicra atrovirens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation programs."
