    "intro": "Arundo tibialis, commonly known as Tibetan reed, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Its fibrous stalks have been traditionally used for thatching and weaving in local communities."
