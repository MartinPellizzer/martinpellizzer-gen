    "intro": "Antimima pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf antplant, is a small, carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and specialized structures for trapping small insects. The plant produces a dense mat of leaves that form a rosette, creating a humid microenvironment conducive to insect capture. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaf surfaces secrete digestive enzymes. Antimima pygmaea plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by breaking down captured prey."
