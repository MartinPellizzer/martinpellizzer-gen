It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that can climb and twine around other plants or structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Arundinaria scandens is native to eastern North America and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
