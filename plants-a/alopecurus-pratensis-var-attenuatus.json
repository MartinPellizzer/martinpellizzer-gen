It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. This variant is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and soil stabilization."
