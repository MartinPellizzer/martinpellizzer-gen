    "intro": "Agalmyla insularis subsp. prionodes, commonly known as the island agalmyla, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or montane habitats. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
