    "intro": "Apostasia thorelii, commonly known as the Thorell's spathephyllum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy spathe that encloses a cluster of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Apostasia thorelii is considered a conservation concern."
