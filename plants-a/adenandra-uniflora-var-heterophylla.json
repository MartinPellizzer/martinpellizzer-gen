    "intro": "Adenandra uniflora var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable adenandra, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either entire or lobed depending on the habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is often aromatic, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variation in leaf structure makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
