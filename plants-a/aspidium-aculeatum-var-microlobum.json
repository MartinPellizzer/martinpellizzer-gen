    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. microlobum, commonly known as the small-lobed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, contributing to its ability to colonize wet areas. The plant's botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
