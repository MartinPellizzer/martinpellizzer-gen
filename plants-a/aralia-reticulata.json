It features compound leaves with a distinctive, palmate shape and a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a showy, spadix-like structure. Its berries are red and edible, though often consumed by birds. Aralia reticulata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
