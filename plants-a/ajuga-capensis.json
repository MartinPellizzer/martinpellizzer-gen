    "intro": "Ajuga capensis, commonly known as African bugloss, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Ajuga capensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
