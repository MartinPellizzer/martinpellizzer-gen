    "intro": "Anil saxicola, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky soils or in crevices. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Anil saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
