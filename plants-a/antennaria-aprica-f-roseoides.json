    "intro": "Antennaria aprica f. roseoides, commonly known as the rose-like sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. It features tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its delicate appearance and unique floral structure, it is a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
