    "intro": "Astragalus atratus var. owyheensis, commonly known as the Owens Valley milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spiny leaves typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
