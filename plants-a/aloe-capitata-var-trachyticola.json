It features a short, upright stem with a dense rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
