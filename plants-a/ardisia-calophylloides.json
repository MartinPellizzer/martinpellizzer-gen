It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it visually striking. The berries are an important food source for various bird species, contributing to seed dispersal in its natural habitat."
