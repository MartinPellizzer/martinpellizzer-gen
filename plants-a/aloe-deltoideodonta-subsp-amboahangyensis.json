    "intro": "Aloe deltoideodonta subsp. amboahangyensis, commonly known as the Amboahangyensis aloe, is a rare succulent native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
