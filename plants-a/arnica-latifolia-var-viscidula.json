    "intro": "Arnica latifolia var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, basal leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are composed of many tiny tubular florets arranged in a composite head. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The sticky resin on its leaves and stems has historically been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
