    "intro": "Acacia triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, triangular-shaped leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness. The seeds of Acacia triangularis are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia triangularis is primarily native to southeastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is also known as the coastal wattle due to its frequent occurrence along the coastline. Acacia triangularis is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia triangularis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to warm climate, often found in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for reforestation and land rehabilitation projects. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
