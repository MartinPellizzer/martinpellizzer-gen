    "intro": "Aira juncea, commonly known as false wheat, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a grass species that typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a thin, papery husk, which facilitates wind dispersal. Aira juncea is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
