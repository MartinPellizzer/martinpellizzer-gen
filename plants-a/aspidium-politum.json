    "intro": "Aspidium politum, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy fronds that give it a delicate and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves. Aspidium politum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
