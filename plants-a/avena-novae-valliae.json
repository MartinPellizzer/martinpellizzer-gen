It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates."
