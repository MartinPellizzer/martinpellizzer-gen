    "intro": "Astragalus unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, single-lobed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and taprooted, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus unilateralis is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
