    "intro": "Allantodia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland allantodia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Allantodia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in naturalized garden settings."
