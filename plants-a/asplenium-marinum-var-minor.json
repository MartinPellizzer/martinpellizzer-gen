    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea spleenwort, is a small, creeping fern that thrives in coastal and maritime environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated along the edges. This variety is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded areas near the shoreline. Its fronds are usually compact and form dense mats, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh habitat. The plant is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic exposure to seawater, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
