    "intro": "Acacia enervia subsp. explicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects.",

It is found in the southern and central regions of the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas. This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia enervia subsp. explicata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and low rainfall, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in parts of Western Australia and Southwestern Australia. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in degraded landscapes. It is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for local wildlife. Its introduction has helped in restoring vegetation in areas affected by land degradation."
