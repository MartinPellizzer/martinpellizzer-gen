It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a feather. Asplenium macrophyllum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
