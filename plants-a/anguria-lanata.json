    "intro": "Anguria lanata, commonly known as the hairy cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, ridged stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, spiny fruits. Its fruit, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, is typically green with a rough, bumpy surface. Anguria lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
