    "intro": "Aristida helleriana, commonly known as Heller's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Aristida helleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
