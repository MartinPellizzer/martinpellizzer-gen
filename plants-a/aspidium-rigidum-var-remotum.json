    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum var. remotum, commonly known as the remote water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of spongy, water-retaining tissue. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
