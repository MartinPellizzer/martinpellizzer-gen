    "intro": "Abies sibirica f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Siberian fir, is a compact, slow-growing coniferous shrub. It is a natural variant of the Siberian fir, characterized by its dense, rounded form and shorter stature compared to the typical species. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This form is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in colder climates.",

It is found in countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. This plant thrives in cold climates and is commonly found in taiga and subalpine forests. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Its distribution is closely associated with high-altitude environments where temperatures are low and precipitation is abundant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sibirica f. pumila was mainly introduced to areas with cold, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The distribution includes parts of Eastern Europe, Siberia, and the far eastern regions of Russia. It has also been introduced to some areas in North America, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions. This plant is valued for its slow growth and distinctive, conical shape."
