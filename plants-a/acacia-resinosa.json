    "intro": "Acacia resinosa, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is a member of the legume family. The plant produces a distinctive resin that has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians. Its leaves are bipinnate, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Acacia resinosa plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia resinosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore-based reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants that typically have legume fruits and often form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or bean family, characterized by their pod-like fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often producing a resinous substance. Its species is Acacia resinosa, a specific type of acacia known for its unique characteristics and ecological role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia resinosa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central regions of the state. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely linked to the arid and semi-arid environments of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia resinosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
