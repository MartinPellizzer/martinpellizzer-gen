    "intro": "Alsine elongata, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine elongata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, where it thrives in poor, well-drained conditions."
