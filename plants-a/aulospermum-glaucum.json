    "intro": "Aulospermum glaucum, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and blue to gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Aulospermum glaucum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
