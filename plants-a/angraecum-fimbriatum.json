    "intro": "Angraecum fimbriatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, white to pale blue flowers with intricate, fringed petals. The plant typically blooms at night, a trait that aligns with its pollination by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Angraecum fimbriatum is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
