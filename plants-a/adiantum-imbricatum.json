    "intro": "Adiantum imbricatum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan, with a distinctive rachis that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests, and thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorus. Adiantum imbricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.",
