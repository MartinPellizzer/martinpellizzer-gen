    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 trichomaniforme nothosubsp. trichomaniforme, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile, clonal hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium trichomanoides*. It exhibits morphological characteristics intermediate between its parent species, with finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that resemble those of its ancestors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a trait shared with other ferns in the Aspleniaceae family. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce spores and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
