    "intro": "Aeschynomene trigonocarpa, commonly known as the three-angled aeschynomene, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Aeschynomene trigonocarpa is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage crop."
