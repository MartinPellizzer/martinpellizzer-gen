    "intro": "Achyrocline yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunguilla sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
