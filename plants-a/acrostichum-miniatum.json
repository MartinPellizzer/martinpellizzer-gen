    "intro": "Acrostichum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum miniatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
