    "intro": "Agrostis nana var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine and paramo ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is adapted to poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
