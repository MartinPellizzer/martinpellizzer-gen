It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale yellow to brown flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain grassland ecosystems. It is also used in some traditional herbal practices for its purported medicinal properties."
