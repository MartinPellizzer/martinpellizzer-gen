It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Astragalus collinus var. collinus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
