    "intro": "Astrotricha biddulphiana, commonly known as the Biddulph's starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
