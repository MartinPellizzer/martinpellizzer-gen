    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina f. transiens, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, mat-like growths in garden settings."
