    "intro": "Axonopus carajasensis, commonly known as the Brazilian carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
