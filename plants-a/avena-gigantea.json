    "intro": "Avena gigantea, commonly known as giant oat, is a tall, perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, slender leaves and panicles of fluffy, white to grayish flowers. The plant can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest grasses in its native habitat. Its seeds are small and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Avena gigantea is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open areas."
