This hybrid species is found in the mountainous regions of these countries. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitude and moist conditions. The plant is commonly found in mixed forests and along mountain slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies \u00d7 borisii-regis was mainly introduced to Europe as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates. It is a hybrid between Abies beringera and Abies sachalinensis, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for a range of landscaping applications. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
