    "intro": "Aphragmus obscurus, commonly known as the dark aphragmus, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aphragmus obscurus is considered a species of conservation concern."
