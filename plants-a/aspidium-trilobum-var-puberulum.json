    "intro": "Aspidium trilobum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, pubescent texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and damp forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic and bog gardens."
