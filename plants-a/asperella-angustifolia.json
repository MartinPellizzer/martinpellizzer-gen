    "intro": "Asperella angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved asperella, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Asperella angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
