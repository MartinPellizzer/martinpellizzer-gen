    "intro": "Acer spicatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Acer spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
