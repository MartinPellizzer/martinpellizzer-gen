    "intro": "Asplenium cicutarium, commonly known as the harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium cicutarium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
