    "intro": "Arabis microphylla var. macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
