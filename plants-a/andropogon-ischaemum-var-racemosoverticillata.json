    "intro": "Andropogon ischaemum var. racemosoverticillata, commonly known as the racemosoverticillate bluestem, is a variant of the common bluestem grass. It is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets arranged in a racemosoverticillate pattern, which is a distinctive branching structure. This variant is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
