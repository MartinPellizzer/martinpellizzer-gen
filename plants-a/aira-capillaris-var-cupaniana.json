    "intro": "Aira capillaris var. cupaniana, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, narrow leaf blades, and a clumping growth habit. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
