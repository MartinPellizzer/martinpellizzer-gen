    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon inaequale is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This species typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal areas or near water sources. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both dry and wet conditions. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon inaequale was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its distinctive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior."
