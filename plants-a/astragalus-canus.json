It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers.

Astragalus canus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
