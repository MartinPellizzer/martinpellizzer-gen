    "intro": "Acaulimalva pazensis, commonly known as the Paz\u00f3n's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton, hibiscus, and okra. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It has simple, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Bolivia's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva pazensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in soils that are rich in organic matter and well-drained. This plant is commonly found in the understory of forests, where it benefits from the filtered sunlight. It has been introduced to several regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
