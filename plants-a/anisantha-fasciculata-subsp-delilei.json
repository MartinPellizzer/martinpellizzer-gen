    "intro": "Anisantha fasciculata subsp. delilei, commonly known as the Delile's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
