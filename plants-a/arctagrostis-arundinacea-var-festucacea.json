    "intro": "Arctagrostis arundinacea var. festucacea, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed florets. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass and forage production. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread and form dense stands, making it a resilient and widely cultivated species."
