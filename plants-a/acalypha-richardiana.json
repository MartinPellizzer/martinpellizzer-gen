This species is found in the island nation of the Comoros, which is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa. It thrives in the tropical climate and diverse ecosystems of the Comoros archipelago. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha richardiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there during the 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread establishment. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora."
