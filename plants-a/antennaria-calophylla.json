    "intro": "Antennaria calophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Antennaria calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
