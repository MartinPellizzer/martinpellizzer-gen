    "intro": "Aechmea allenii, commonly known as the Allen's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Aechmea allenii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
