    "intro": "Aspilia grazielae, commonly known as the Grace's torchflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the high-altitude grasslands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a dense, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous yellow-orange ray florets. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Aspilia grazielae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
