    "intro": "Asplenium floccigerum, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance due to the dense covering of fine, silky hairs on its fronds. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, curling appearance."
