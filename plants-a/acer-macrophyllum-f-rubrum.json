    "intro": "Acer macrophyllum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a variant of the bigleaf maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value.",
