    "intro": "Ampelopsis aconitifolia var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"setulosa.\" It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries, which are usually blue or black, are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their mild toxicity."
