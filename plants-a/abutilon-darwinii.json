    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon darwinii is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry forests and shrublands. Its natural range extends into parts of Peru and Ecuador as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon darwinii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in gardens, parks, and as a decorative shrub. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas outside its native range. However, in certain regions, it is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
