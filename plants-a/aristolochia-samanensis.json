    "intro": "Aristolochia samanensis, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic aril. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
