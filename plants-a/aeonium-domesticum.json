The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Aeonium domesticum is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
