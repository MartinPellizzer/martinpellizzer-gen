    "intro": "Antennaria canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Antennaria canadensis is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
