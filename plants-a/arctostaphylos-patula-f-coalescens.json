    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula f. coalescens, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped pink or red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to rocky soils and coastal conditions, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
