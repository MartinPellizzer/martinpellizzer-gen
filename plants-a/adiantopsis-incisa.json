    "intro": "Adiantopsis incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often cut or lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Adiantopsis incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.",
