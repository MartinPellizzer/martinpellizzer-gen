    "intro": "Aerangis ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink or purple hues with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aerangis ellisii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
