It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
