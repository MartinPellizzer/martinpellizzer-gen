    "intro": "Aira aquatica var. duplicata, commonly known as water flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
