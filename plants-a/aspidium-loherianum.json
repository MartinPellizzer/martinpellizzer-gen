    "intro": "Aspidium loherianum, commonly known as the Loher's water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, wiry stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium loherianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
