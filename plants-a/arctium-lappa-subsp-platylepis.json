    "intro": "Arctium lappa subsp. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and a distinctive, umbrella-like flower head. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
