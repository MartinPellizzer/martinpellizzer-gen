    "intro": "Agrostis pourretii, commonly known as the Pourret's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid environments and its preference for partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
