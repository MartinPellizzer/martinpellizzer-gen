    "intro": "Anaphalis possietica, commonly known as the silverleaf\u5e1a\u8349, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anaphalis possietica is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes."
