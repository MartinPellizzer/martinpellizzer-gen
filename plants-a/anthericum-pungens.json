    "intro": "Anthericum pungens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, irritating hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often used in traditional medicine. Anthericum pungens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
