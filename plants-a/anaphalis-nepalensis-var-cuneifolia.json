It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and small, clustered flower heads that resemble miniature daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, producing a soft white or pale yellow coloration. The species is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and supporting pollinators."
