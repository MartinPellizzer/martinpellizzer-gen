    "intro": "Armeria duriuscula, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Armeria duriuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
