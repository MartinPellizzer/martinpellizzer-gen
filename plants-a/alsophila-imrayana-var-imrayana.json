    "intro": "Alsophila imrayana var. imrayana, commonly known as the Imrayana tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
