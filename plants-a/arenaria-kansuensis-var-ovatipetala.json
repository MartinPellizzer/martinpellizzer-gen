    "intro": "Arenaria kansuensis var. ovatipetala, commonly known as the ovate-petaled sandflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five ovate petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats."
