    "intro": "Andreoskia cardaminifolia, commonly known as the alpine celandine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are palmately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
