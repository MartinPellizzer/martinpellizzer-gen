    "intro": "Acer trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Acer trilobum is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
