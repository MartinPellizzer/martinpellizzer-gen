    "intro": "Aethionema suffruticosum, commonly known as the rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are bright yellow and occur in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer. Aethionema suffruticosum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
