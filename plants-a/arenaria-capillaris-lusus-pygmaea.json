    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris lusus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sandpink, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native habitat."
