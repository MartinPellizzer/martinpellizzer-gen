    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. molliusculum, commonly known as the hairy alyssum, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features dense, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Native to the western United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
