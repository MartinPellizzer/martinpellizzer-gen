    "intro": "Aira flexuosa subsp. setacea, commonly known as the tufted false oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
