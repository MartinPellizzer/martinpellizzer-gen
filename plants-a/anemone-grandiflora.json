    "intro": "Anemone grandiflora, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features showy, white to pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often hairy. Its root system consists of rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in moist, well-drained soils. Anemone grandiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
