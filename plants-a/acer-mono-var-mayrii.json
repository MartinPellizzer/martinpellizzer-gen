    "intro": "Acer mono var. mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii maple, is a rare and unique variant of the mono maple. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. This plant is native to a limited region in China, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
