    "intro": "Akania lucens, commonly known as the shining willow or white willow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale green leaves that emit a slight fragrance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, winged seeds. Akania lucens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional medicine."
