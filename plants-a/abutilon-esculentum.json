    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon esculentum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and parts of the Caribbean. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes. It is also known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow. Its native range extends into some parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary distribution remains in the Americas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon esculentum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential as a vegetable crop. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. It is often cultivated in home gardens and small-scale farms due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
