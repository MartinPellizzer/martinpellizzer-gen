    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrocephala var. negeri is primarily native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. This plant thrives in coastal and subcoastal areas, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and disturbed sites. The species is well adapted to maritime climates with cool, moist conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrocephala var. negeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variety is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in the country. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
