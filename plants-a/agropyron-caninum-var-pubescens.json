    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
