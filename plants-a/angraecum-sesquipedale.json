    "intro": "Angraecum sesquipedale, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow petals and a distinctive star-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like the hawkmoth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
