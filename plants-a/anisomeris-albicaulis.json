    "intro": "Anisomeris albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed desert dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Anisomeris albicaulis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides forage for wildlife."
