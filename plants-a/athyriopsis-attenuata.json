    "intro": "Athyriopsis attenuata, commonly known as the slender male fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyriopsis attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in horticultural collections."
