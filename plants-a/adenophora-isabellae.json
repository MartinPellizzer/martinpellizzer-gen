    "intro": "Adenophora isabellae, commonly known as the Isabella bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically green when immature and turn dark purple as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often growing in rocky or open woodland habitats. Adenophora isabellae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, showy blooms.",
