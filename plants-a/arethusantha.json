    "intro": "Arethusantha, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming cereus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Arethusantha species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits. They require well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
