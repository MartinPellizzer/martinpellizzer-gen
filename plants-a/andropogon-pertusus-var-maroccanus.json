It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
