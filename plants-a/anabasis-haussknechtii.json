It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Anabasis haussknechtii is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
