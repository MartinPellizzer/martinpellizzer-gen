    "intro": "Aloe lingua var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that produce clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves with a bluish-green color. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
