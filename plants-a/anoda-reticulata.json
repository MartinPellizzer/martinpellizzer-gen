It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which is a notable botanical feature. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Anoda reticulata is also known for its small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds."
