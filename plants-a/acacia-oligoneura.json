    "intro": "Acacia oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. The wood of Acacia oligoneura is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oligoneura is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia oligoneura is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oligoneura was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is widely planted in arid and semi-arid regions across Australia and parts of Southeast Asia."
