    "intro": "Acer amoenum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant colors of red, orange, and yellow during the autumn season. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with finely serrated edges, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer amoenum is primarily native to China, specifically the regions of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei. It thrives in mountainous areas with temperate climates and is commonly found in forests and rocky slopes. This species is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Vietnam and southern Tibet. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed deciduous forests. Acer amoenum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its colorful autumn foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amoenum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique characteristics. It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of the country, where it has been cultivated in gardens and parks. Although it is not native to North America, it has been widely planted for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in local environments. Despite its popularity, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown."
