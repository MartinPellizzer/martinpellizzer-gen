    "intro": "Astragalus sinaloae, commonly known as the Sinaloa milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Its leaves are compound, with several leaflets that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Astragalus sinaloae is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
