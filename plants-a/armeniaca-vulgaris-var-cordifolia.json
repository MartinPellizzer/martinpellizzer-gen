    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces sweet, fuzzy fruits similar to common peaches, though it is less widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, which features deep green, velvety leaves with a unique heart-like shape. Botanically, it is closely related to other Prunus species and shares similar growth habits and fruiting patterns."
