    "intro": "Austrostipa frankliniae, commonly known as Franklin's wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Austrostipa frankliniae is often found in open habitats such as plains, hills, and coastal areas."
