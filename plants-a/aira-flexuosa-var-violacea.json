It features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, violet-colored flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are often matted together, forming dense clumps that help retain soil moisture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
