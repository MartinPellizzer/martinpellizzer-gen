    "intro": "Achoriphragma longicarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited achoriphragma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, parsley-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
