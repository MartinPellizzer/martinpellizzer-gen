    "intro": "Anthericum zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a showy spathe, typical of many aroid species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and ability to add vertical interest to the landscape."
