    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pulvinata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in various regions across the country, including the North and South Islands. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, shrublands, and open forests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with mild to temperate climates. Acaena pulvinata is an important component of the native flora in New Zealand's ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pulvinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact."
