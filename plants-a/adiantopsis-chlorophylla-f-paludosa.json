    "intro": "Adiantopsis chlorophylla f. paludosa, commonly known as the bog fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands. The plant features finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, making it a characteristic species of wetland ecosystems.",
