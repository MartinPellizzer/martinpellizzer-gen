    "intro": "Anthurium obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of red or orange. Anthurium obtusum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure."
