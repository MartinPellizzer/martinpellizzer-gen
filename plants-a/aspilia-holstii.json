It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of bright red to orange tubular flowers, which are surrounded by a cluster of white bracts. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with greyish-green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, rounded shape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
