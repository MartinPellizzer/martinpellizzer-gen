    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium subsp. segetalis, commonly known as field cowbane, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound umbels of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. The fruit is a dry, ribbed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
