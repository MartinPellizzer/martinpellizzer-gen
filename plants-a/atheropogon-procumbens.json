    "intro": "Atheropogon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow, smooth, and typically have a bluish-green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Atheropogon procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
