    "intro": "Ageratina bustamenta, commonly known as the mountain blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It is often found in rocky or open areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Ageratina bustamenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like flowers."
