    "intro": "Acacia donaldi, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as true leaves, reducing water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia donaldi is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in spinifex plains and mulga woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Acacia donaldi is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia donaldi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species. It has been used for erosion control and as a source of timber and fodder. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
