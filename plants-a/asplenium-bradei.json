It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically clustered around the base of the plant. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium bradei is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. It is a relatively small fern, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height."
