    "intro": "Aetheolaena piedrahitae, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing or trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. Aetheolaena piedrahitae plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
