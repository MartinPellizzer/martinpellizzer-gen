    "intro": "Adenopus eglandulosus, commonly known as the smooth adenopus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.",
