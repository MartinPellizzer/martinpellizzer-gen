It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into spiky, red or brown fruits. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, spicy scent. The rhizomes and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom."
