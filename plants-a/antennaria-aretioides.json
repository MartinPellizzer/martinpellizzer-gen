    "intro": "Antennaria aretioides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitats. Antennaria aretioides is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
