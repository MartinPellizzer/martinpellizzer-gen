    "intro": "Aspidium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water Ferns (Hydropteraceae). It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into lanceolate segments. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in water or damp soil. Aspidium cordifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
