    "intro": "Alchemilla supina, commonly known as the prostrate lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
