    "intro": "Abutilon theophrasti var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its fuzzy, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to East Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including the Americas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas.",

This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, growing in areas with high humidity and mild temperatures. It thrives in disturbed habitats like roadsides, forest edges, and cultivated fields. The plant is often associated with secondary successional areas and is known for its fibrous bark and ornamental value. Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions within its geographic origin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon theophrasti var. chinense was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in the southern and western regions of the country. The plant is also used in horticulture for its fast growth and ease of cultivation. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant species and ecosystem balance."
