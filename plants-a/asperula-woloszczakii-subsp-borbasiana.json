    "intro": "Asperula woloszczakii subsp. borbasiana, commonly known as the Borbasian azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pink to reddish-purple blooms, which appear in spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
