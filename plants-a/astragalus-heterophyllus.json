    "intro": "Astragalus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its roots are often deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus heterophyllus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife in its native range."
