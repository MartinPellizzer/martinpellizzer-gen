    "intro": "Aster nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aster nikoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
