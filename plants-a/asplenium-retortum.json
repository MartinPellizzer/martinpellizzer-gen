    "intro": "Asplenium retortum, commonly known as the twisted spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often twisted or curled, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Asplenium retortum is characterized by its compact size and distinctive foliage, making it a unique addition to botanical collections."
