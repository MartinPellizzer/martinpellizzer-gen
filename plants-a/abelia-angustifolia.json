    "intro": "Abelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems and opposite, narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It is well-suited for partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and attractive foliage.",

This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests and along stream banks. It is well adapted to the humid climate and fertile soils of its native habitat. Abelia angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia angustifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats. This plant is valued for its fragrant, tubular flowers and its ability to thrive in partial shade. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and naturalized in several areas. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competition with native vegetation."
