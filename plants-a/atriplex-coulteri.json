    "intro": "Atriplex coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and wasps. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Atriplex coulteri is also known for its salt tolerance, making it a valuable plant in saline environments."
