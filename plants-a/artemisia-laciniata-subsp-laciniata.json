It is characterized by its finely dissected, silvery-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
