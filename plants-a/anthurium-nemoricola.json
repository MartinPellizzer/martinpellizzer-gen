    "intro": "Anthurium nemoricola, commonly known as the forest anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests in Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence that often displays a vibrant red or orange hue. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. Anthurium nemoricola plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
