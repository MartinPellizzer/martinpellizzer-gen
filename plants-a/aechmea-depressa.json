    "intro": "Aechmea depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Aechmea depressa is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
