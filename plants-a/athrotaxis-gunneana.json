    "intro": "Athrotaxis gunneana, commonly known as the Gunnean alpine ash, is a rare and endangered conifer native to Tasmania. It is a medium-sized tree with a straight trunk and a narrow, conical crown. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
