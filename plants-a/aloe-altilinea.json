    "intro": "Aloe altilinea, commonly known as the tall aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching at the base. The plant produces narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in terminal inflorescences, consisting of yellow to orange tubular blooms. Aloe altilinea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and showing resilience to drought conditions."
