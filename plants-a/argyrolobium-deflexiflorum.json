    "intro": "Argyrolobium deflexiflorum, commonly known as the flexiflorous silverlobium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
