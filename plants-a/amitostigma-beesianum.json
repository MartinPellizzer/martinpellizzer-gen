    "intro": "Amitostigma beesianum, commonly known as the Beesian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has a clump-forming growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
