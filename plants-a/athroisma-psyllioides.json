    "intro": "Athroisma psyllioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind. Athroisma psyllioides is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
