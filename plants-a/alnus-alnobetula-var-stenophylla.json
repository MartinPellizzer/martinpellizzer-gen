    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in riparian zones. It has small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
