    "intro": "Acosta reichenbachioides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its striking, almost otherworldly appearance. Its flowers open only at night, and it is considered one of the most elusive plants in the Andes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is critically endangered and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.",
