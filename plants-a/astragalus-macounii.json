    "intro": "Astragalus macounii, commonly known as Macoun's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Astragalus macounii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
