    "intro": "Amylocarpus arenarius, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and moths. Amylocarpus arenarius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
