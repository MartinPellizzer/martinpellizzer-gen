It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Its aromatic leaves and resilience make it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
