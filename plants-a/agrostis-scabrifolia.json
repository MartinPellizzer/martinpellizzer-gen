    "intro": "Agrostis scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in forest understories. Agrostis scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
