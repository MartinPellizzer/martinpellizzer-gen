    "intro": "Alnus crispa subsp. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along forest edges. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
