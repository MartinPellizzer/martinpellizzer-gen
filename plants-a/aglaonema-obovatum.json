    "intro": "Aglaonema obovatum, commonly known as the silver queen plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, oval-shaped leaves with a striking silver and green mottled pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aglaonema obovatum is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
