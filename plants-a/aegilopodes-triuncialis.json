    "intro": "Aegilopodes triuncialis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilopodes triuncialis is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
