    "intro": "Axonopus lineatus, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense, low mats and has slender, elongated leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
