    "intro": "Andropogon preamaturus, commonly known as early bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon preamaturus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
