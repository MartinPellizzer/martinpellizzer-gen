It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces striking, dark purple berries that persist into winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Antrospermum floribundum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forest edges."
