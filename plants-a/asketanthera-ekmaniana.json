It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright red bracts that surround its small white flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in certain regions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
