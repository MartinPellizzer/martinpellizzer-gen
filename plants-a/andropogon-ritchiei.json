    "intro": "Andropogon ritchiei, commonly known as Hitchcock's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hitchcock's switchgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
