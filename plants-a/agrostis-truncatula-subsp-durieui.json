The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means. Due to its ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
