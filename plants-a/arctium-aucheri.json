    "intro": "Arctium aucheri, commonly known as the greater burdock. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive and can reach deep into the soil, making it a hardy and resilient species. Arctium aucheri is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
