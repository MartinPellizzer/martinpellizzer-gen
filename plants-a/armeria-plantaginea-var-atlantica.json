    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features compact, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline and windy environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
