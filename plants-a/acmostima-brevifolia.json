    "intro": "Acmostima brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved acmostima, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Acmostima brevifolia is often found in marshy areas and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.",
