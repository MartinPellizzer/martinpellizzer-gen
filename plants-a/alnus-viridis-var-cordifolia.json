    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are alternate and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. This species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
