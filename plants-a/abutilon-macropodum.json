    "intro": "Abutilon macropodum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous bark and hairy foliage are adaptations to its native environment, helping it retain moisture and withstand environmental stress. Abutilon macropodum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon macropodum is primarily native to Senegal. It is found in the dry savannas and grasslands of this West African country. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Senegal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon macropodum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its adaptability to different soil types and climate conditions has facilitated its establishment across a wide range of environments. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
