It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble a fiddle, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant grows in rocky, open habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Amsinckia yosemitensis is a rare and endemic species, making it a notable part of the region's botanical diversity."
