    "intro": "Arctotis repens, commonly known as the creeping arctotis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
