    "intro": "Allophylus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled alderleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have elongated petioles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Allophylus longipetiolatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
