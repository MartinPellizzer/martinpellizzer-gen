    "intro": "Agropyron striatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in restoration projects. Agropyron striatum is also valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes used in livestock forage."
