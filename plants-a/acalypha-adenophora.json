    "intro": "Acalypha adenophora, commonly known as the woolly hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, or woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, often yellow or red, bract-based flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and may have a slight serration along the edges. Acalypha adenophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha adenophora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. Its distribution extends to some Pacific islands as well, where it has been introduced and naturalized.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha adenophora was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal habitats and disturbed forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems."
