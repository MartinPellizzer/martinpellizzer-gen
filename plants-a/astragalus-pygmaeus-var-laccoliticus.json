    "intro": "Astragalus pygmaeus var. laccoliticus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
