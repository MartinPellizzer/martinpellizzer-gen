    "intro": "Acrostichum stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The narrow-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.",
