    "intro": "Aspidium expansum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Aspidium expansum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
