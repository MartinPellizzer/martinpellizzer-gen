    "intro": "Athyrium squamipes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silvery, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
