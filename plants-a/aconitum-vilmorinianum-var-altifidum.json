    "intro": "Aconitum vilmorinianum var. altifidum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a distinctive spurred shape, and its roots are tuberous, contributing to its robust growth. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.",
