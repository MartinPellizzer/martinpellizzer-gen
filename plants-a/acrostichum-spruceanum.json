    "intro": "Acrostichum spruceanum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns. It is often found in wetlands, forest floors, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.",
