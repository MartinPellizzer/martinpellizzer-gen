    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. minor, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a variant of the female fern species native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Athyrium genus."
