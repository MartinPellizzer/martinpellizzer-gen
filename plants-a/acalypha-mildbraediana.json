    "intro": "Acalypha mildbraediana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that range from green to red in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mildbraediana is primarily native to the island of New Guinea. It is found in the lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas of the eastern and western parts of the island. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in both primary and disturbed forest habitats. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mildbraediana was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat. Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
