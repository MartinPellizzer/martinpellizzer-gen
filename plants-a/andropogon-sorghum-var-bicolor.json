    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. bicolor, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It features erect stems that can grow up to 3\u20134 meters in height, with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lipped flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Sorghum is a member of the Poaceae family and is cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
