    "intro": "Anthurium novencidoanum, commonly known as the nine-leaf anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. Anthurium novencidoanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
