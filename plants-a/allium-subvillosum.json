    "intro": "Allium subvillosum, commonly known as the hairy leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of white or pale purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
