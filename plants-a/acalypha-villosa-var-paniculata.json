    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha villosa var. paniculata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. This variant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and flowering structures. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant's native range extends into parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha villosa var. paniculata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has become naturalized in coastal and disturbed areas. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along streams, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it can also become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation. Its presence has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
