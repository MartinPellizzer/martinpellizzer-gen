    "intro": "Asplenium bicrenatum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant its distinctive, lace-like appearance."
