    "intro": "Asplenium resectum var. rahaoense, commonly known as the Rahao's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the shield fern genus. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters near the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Asplenium genus. This variety is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
