It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces delicate pink or white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
