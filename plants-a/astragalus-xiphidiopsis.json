    "intro": "Astragalus xiphidiopsis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus xiphidiopsis is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine."
