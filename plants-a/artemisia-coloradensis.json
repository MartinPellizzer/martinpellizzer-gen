    "intro": "Artemisia coloradensis, commonly known as Colorado silver sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
