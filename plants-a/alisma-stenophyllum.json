    "intro": "Alisma stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Alisma stenophyllum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
