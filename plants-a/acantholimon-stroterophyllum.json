    "intro": "Acantholimon stroterophyllum, commonly known as the Strother's flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with blue to purple flowers. The plant features linear, glabrous leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon stroterophyllum is primarily native to Iran. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in mountainous areas and dry slopes. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran, reflecting its specialized requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon stroterophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and dunes, where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is often associated with sandy or gravelly habitats, making it a common invasive species in certain ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat structure."
