    "intro": "Anthurium subovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are its inflorescences, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium subovatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
