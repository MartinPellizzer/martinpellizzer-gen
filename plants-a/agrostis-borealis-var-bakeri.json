    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's Boreal Bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to northern regions of North America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of lakes and ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is a cool-season grass that is adapted to temperate and subarctic climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
