    "intro": "Aspidosperma cylindrocarpon var. genuinum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy of elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to large, round fruits with a thick, fibrous outer layer. The fruit's pulp is rich in antioxidants and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical significance lies in its role in the rainforest ecosystem and its economic value in the global market."
