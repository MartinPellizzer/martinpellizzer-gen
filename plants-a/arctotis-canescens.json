It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is drought-tolerant and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
