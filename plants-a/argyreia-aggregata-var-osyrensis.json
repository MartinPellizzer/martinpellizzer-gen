    "intro": "Argyreia aggregata var. osyrensis, commonly known as the red rafflesia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and intensely fragrant flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The flowers are typically red or orange with a white or yellow center, and they emit a strong, meaty odor to attract pollinators. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients. It is also notable for its unique structure, with a fleshy, umbrella-shaped calyx that encloses the reproductive organs."
