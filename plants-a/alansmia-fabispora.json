    "intro": "Alansmia fabispora, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Alansmia fabispora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
