    "intro": "Asplenium horridum var. humile, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a terrestrial fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more refined appearance compared to the typical A. horridum."
