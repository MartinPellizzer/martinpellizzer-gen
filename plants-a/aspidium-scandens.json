    "intro": "Aspidium scandens, commonly known as the climbing wood fern, is a vascular fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to climb or spread along surfaces. The plant features feather-like fronds with a distinctive, often bipinnate structure, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. Aspidium scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
