The plant produces a single, large, spathaceous inflorescence with a showy, purple spathe and a central, spiky structure resembling a phallus. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are pollinated by specific insect species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique morphology."
