It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically white or pale purple in color. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, bulbous root system and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. This subspecies is closely related to other allium species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary uses."
