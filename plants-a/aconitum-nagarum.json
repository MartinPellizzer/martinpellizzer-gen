    "intro": "Aconitum nagarum, commonly known as the Nepal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.",
