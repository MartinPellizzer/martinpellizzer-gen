    "intro": "Atragene patens, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atragene patens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
