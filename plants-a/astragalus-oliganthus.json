    "intro": "Astragalus oliganthus, commonly known as the few-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
