It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Arabis allionii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
