    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pungens f. glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically pink or red. Its small, leathery leaves are arranged in pairs along the stems, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
