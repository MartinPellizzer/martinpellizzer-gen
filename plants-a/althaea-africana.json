It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Althaea africana is also valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine."
