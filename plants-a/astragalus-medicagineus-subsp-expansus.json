    "intro": "Astragalus medicagineus subsp. expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
