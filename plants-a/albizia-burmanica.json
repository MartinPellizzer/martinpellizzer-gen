    "intro": "Albizia burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia burmanica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
