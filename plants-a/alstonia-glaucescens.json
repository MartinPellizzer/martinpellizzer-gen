It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and large, ovate leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Alstonia glaucescens is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and medicinal properties. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
