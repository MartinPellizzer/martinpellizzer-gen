    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. insubrica, commonly known as the rough oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often grow in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges."
