    "intro": "Ardisia lanaensis, commonly known as the Lanae's beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Following flowering, it produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Ardisia lanaensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
