It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Aquarius palifolius is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain environments."
