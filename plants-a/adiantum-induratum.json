    "intro": "Adiantum induratum, commonly known as the hardy maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum induratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.",
