    "intro": "Amaryllis pudica, commonly known as the shy lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that open only in response to touch, a unique trait that gives it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for foliage of other plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Amaryllis pudica is a popular ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and intriguing behavior."
