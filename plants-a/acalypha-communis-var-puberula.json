    "intro": "Acalypha communis var. puberula, commonly known as velvetleaf or velvetleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become an invasive species in certain areas.",

It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist lowland areas and along riverbanks. This variant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in secondary forests and agricultural landscapes. It is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands. The plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. puberula was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control projects."
