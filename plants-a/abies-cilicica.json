    "intro": "Abies cilicica, commonly known as the Eastern Caucasian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iran. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests with other conifers. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes. The plant is commonly found in the eastern and central parts of Turkey. It is also present in parts of Lebanon and Syria, particularly in the higher elevations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cilicica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high altitudes, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and cool summers, making it suitable for mountainous and forested landscapes. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its introduction has also contributed to reforestation efforts in some parts of Europe and the Middle East. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
