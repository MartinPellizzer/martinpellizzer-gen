    "intro": "Aspidium nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the western United States. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns. Its presence often indicates clean, well-oxygenated water, making it an indicator species for aquatic ecosystems."
