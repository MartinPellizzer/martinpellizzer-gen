    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarius var. elatus, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage plant."
