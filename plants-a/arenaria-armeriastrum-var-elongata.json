    "intro": "Arenaria armeriastrum var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are elongated and often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
