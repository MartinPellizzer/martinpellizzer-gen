    "intro": "Allium littoreum, commonly known as sea garlic, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and ecological contexts. Allium littoreum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
