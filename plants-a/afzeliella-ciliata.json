    "intro": "Afzeliella ciliata, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Afzeliella ciliata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
