    "intro": "Asarum sieboldii var. dimidiatum, commonly known as the Japanese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features a tuberous root system and has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers clustered in a spicate inflorescence, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine."
