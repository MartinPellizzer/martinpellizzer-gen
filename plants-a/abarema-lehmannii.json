    "intro": "Abarema lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's sensitiveplant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits. Abarema lehmannii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli.",

It is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened plant species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema lehmannii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ecological restoration projects and ornamental horticulture. It is commonly found in degraded areas where it helps in soil stabilization and biodiversity recovery. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests. Its introduction has been associated with both positive ecological impacts and potential invasiveness in certain regions. Due to its adaptability, it has become a subject of study for its role in ecosystem dynamics."
