    "intro": "Adiantum delicatulum f. tremulum, commonly known as the tremulous maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are usually\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) and can reach heights of up to 30 inches, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The plant's botanical beauty is enhanced by its ability to form dense, lush foliage that adds texture and interest to woodland settings.",
