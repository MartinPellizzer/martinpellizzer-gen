    "intro": "Anthyllis fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian anthyllis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, supporting nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor habitats. Anthyllis fennica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
