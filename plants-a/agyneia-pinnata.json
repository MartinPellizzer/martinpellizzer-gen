    "intro": "Agyneia pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf agyneia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agyneia pinnata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in some regions."
