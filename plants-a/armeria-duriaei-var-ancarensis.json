    "intro": "Armeria duriaei var. ancarensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, sandy habitat. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal soils, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
