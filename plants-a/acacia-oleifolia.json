    "intro": "Acacia oleifolia, commonly known as the oil acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia oleifolia is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is also valued for its hard wood and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including fuel and construction.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oleifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, and Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic species of these environments. Acacia oleifolia is also known as the \"oil acacia\" due to its high oil content in its seeds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oleifolia was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to tolerate drought. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
