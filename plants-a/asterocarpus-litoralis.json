    "intro": "Asterocarpus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal asterocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It is adapted to salt-laden environments and can tolerate periodic inundation by tidal waters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
