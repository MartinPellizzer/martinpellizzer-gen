    "intro": "Amelanchier florida var. oreophila, commonly known as the Allegheny serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its attractive white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces edible berries in the summer, which are dark blue to black in color and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its spring blossoms and fall foliage, which displays vibrant shades of red and orange."
