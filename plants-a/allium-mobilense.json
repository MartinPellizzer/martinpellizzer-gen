    "intro": "Allium mobilense, commonly known as the Mobile onion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Allium mobilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
