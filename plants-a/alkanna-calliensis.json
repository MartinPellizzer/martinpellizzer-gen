    "intro": "Alkanna calliensis, commonly known as the Mexican bloodroot, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, striking red-orange flower that appears in spring. Its roots contain a red dye, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Alkanna calliensis is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils."
