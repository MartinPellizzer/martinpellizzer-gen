    "intro": "Aechmea lingulata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for small organisms. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and often have a bluish or purplish hue. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding dramatic visual contrast. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
