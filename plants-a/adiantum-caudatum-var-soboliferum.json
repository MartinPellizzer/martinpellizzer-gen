    "intro": "Adiantum caudatum var. soboliferum, commonly known as the long-veined maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant features a delicate, creeping rhizome that produces clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in humid, indoor settings.",
