    "intro": "Acrostichum micradenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional basketry. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
