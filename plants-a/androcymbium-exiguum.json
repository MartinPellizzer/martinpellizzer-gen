    "intro": "Androcymbium exiguum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small, typically pink or purple, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Androcymbium exiguum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as deserts and coastal dunes."
