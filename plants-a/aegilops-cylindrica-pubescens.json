    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica pubescens, commonly known as the bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
