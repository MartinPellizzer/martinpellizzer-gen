    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 badensis, commonly known as the Baden alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces edible, winged seeds. Alnus \u00d7 badensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
