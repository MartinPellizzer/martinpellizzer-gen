    "intro": "Adenophora triphylla f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its hairy foliage and stems are adaptations that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in woodlands and open fields, thriving in partial to full sunlight.",
