    "intro": "Athyrium crinitum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Athyrium crinitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
