    "intro": "Albizia procera var. elata, commonly known as the giant silktree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valued for soil enrichment and as a shade tree."
