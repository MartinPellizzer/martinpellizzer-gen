    "intro": "Antizoma burchelliana, commonly known as the Burchell's ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique ant-plant relationship, where certain ant species reside in its hollow stems. The plant produces small, hairy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Antizoma burchelliana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
