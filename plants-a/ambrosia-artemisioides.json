    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisioides, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight pollen, which is a common allergen. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many regions."
