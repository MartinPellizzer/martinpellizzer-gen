    "intro": "Alnus acuminata var. subsericea, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, sometimes slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
