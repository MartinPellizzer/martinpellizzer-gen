    "intro": "Aechmea farinosa, commonly known as the velvet plant or pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name. Aechmea farinosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
