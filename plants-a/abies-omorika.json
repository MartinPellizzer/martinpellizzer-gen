    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies omorika is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, specifically in parts of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. It thrives in temperate climates with high elevation, often found in mixed forests. This species is commonly associated with the Carpathian and Dinaric mountain ranges. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in areas with moderate precipitation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies omorika was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. This species has been cultivated for its dense foliage and conical shape, making it a popular choice for privacy screens and ornamental purposes. However, it has also been noted to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological role and management in non-native habitats."
