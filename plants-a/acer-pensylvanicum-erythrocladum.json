    "intro": "Acer pensylvanicum erythrocladum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a rare variant of the striped maple. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent in the fall. This plant is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist, acidic soils of forested areas. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge and a distinctive red underside. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.",
