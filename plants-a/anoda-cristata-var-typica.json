It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife species and its historical use in traditional medicine."
