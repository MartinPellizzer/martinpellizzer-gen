    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema moniliformis is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the continent. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Abarema moniliformis is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema moniliformis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Africa and Asia, where it has been cultivated for similar aesthetic reasons. Despite its ornamental value, the plant has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a concern for environmental management in regions where it has become naturalized. However, it remains popular in horticulture for its visual appeal and ease of care."
