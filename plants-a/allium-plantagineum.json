    "intro": "Allium plantagineum, commonly known as wild garlic or rampion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces spherical, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients and aid in its survival during harsh conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along riverbanks. Its strong garlic scent is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds, which also contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
