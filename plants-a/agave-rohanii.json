    "intro": "Agave rohanii, commonly known as the blue agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Agave rohanii is also valued for its use in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits."
