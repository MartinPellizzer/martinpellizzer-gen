    "intro": "Alnus occidentalis, commonly known as the western alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Alnus occidentalis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
