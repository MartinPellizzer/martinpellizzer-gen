    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Acaena. It thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. longifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in regions with temperate climates. This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open areas. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and habitat for various native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. This subspecies is now considered an invasive species in several regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly through its persistent seeds and forms dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its impact on local biodiversity."
