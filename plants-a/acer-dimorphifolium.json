    "intro": "Acer dimorphifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which can vary in shape and size depending on the environmental conditions. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.",
