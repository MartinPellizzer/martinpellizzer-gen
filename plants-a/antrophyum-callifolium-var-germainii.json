    "intro": "Antrophyum callifolium var. germainii, commonly known as the Germain's Cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
