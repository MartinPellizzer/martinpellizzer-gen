    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. hirsutum is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including desert scrub and rocky plains. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas. It is known for its distinctive fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the harsh, dry climates of its origin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. hirsutum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of exotic plant species. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and is often cultivated in gardens."
