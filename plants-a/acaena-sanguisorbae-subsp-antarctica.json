    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic bullock's heart, is a low-growing shrub native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny fruits that contain hard, dark seeds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in subantarctic regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. antarctica is primarily native to the Antarctic region, including the mainland and some subantarctic islands. This subspecies is adapted to the extreme cold and harsh environmental conditions found in these areas. It is commonly found in rocky soils and on dry, exposed sites. The plant plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native invertebrates. Its distribution is limited to the southernmost parts of the Southern Hemisphere.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. antarctica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. This species is now considered a weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has had ecological impacts on local ecosystems."
