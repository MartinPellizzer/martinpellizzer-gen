    "intro": "Aquilegia alpina, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Aquilegia alpina is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
