    "intro": "Astragalus crassispinus, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is well adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus crassispinus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
