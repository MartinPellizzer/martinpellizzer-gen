    "intro": "Atrostemma acutissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive serrated edge, while its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature. Atrostemma acutissimum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
