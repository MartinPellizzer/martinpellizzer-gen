    "intro": "Arthraxon major, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Arthraxon major is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed sites. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
