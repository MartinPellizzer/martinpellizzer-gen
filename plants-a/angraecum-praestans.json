    "intro": "Angraecum praestans, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to the nectar and the scent produced by the plant. Angraecum praestans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
