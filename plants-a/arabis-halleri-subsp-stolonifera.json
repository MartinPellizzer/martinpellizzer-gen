    "intro": "Arabis halleri subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize rocky or alpine soils. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
