    "intro": "Actinostemon estrellensis var. genuinus, commonly known as the Estrellan starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring and is often found in shaded, moist microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
