    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum f. longicarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded alyssum, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that remain on the plant well into autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers and low maintenance requirements."
