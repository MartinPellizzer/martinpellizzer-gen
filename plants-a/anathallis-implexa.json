    "intro": "Anathallis implexa, commonly known as the tangled anathallis, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, wiry stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant produces a single, elongated ovary that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific species of bees, which are attracted to its nectar-rich structure. Anathallis implexa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forest areas."
