    "intro": "Adorium, commonly known as the sacred chamber or place of worship in ancient Roman architecture, is not a botanical term but rather a historical and architectural concept. It refers to a space within a temple dedicated to the display of sacred objects, particularly the cult image of a deity. While not a plant, the term may be confused with botanical names in some contexts. In botanical discussions, it is important to distinguish between architectural terms and actual plant species. If you were referring to a plant, please provide more details for accurate information."
