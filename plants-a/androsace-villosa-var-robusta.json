    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. robusta, commonly known as the hairy Androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of hairy, often woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
