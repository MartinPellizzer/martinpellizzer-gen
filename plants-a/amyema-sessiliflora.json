    "intro": "Amyema sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged alternately along the stem. Amyema sessiliflora plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native birds and insects."
