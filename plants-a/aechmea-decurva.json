    "intro": "Aechmea decurva, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. Aechmea decurva is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
