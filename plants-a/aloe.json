    "intro": "Aloe, commonly known as the aloe vera plant, is a succulent belonging to the Asphodelaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's gel-like substance inside the leaves is widely used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe typically produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the end of its stems. It is native to Africa but is now cultivated in many parts of the world for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
