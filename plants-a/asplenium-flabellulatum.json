    "intro": "Asplenium flabellulatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.
