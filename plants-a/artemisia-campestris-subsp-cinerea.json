    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. cinerea, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces a strong, distinctive scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
