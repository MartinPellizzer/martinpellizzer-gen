    "intro": "Anatherum domingense, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
