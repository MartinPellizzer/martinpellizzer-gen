    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida subsp. hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, cylindrical stems that distinguish it from other members of the genus. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are borne on leafless, erect stalks. Its leaves are typically shield-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
