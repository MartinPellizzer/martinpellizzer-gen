    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema utilis is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. It is commonly found in moist forests and along riverbanks. Its native distribution includes parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema utilis was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Florida and the Gulf Coast, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish itself in disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. It is often found along roadsides, in pastures, and in abandoned fields. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive nature poses challenges for native plant communities and land management efforts."
