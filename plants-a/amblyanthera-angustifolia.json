    "intro": "Amblyanthera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved amblyanthera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and they bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Amblyanthera angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
