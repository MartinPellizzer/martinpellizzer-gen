    "intro": "Angraecopsis schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces a single, elongated stem with a cluster of flowers at the top, and its blooming period occurs during the cooler months. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
