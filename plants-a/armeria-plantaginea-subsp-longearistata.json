It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often have a woolly texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in landscaping."
