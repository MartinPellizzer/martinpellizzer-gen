    "intro": "Acaulimalva rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's mallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens.",

It thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. The plant is known for its distinctive violet flowers and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva rauhii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered invasive in certain regions. It thrives in moist, shady environments and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have raised concerns among conservationists."
