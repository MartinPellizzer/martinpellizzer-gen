    "intro": "Arabis petraea subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging, low-light conditions."
