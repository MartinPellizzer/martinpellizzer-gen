    "intro": "Alyssopsis deflexa, commonly known as the bentleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Alyssopsis deflexa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
