    "intro": "Acantholimon spinicalyx, commonly known as the spinyleaf flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Acantholimon spinicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon spinicalyx is primarily native to Iran. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon spinicalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of flowering plants for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in certain areas, contributing to local biodiversity. However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific habitat requirements."
