    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. mono, commonly known as the single-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often green with a bluish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.",
