It features distinctive, deeply lobed, wavy leaves that give it a unique, almost quilted appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla hybrida var. plicata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
