    "intro": "Anemone grayi, commonly known as the gray anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often with a distinctive purple or reddish hue at the base. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Anemone grayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
