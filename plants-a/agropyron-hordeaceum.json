    "intro": "Agropyron hordeaceum, commonly known as the wheatgrasses, is a species of grass native to the cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Agropyron hordeaceum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
