It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing small, white flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.
