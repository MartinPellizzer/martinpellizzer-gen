    "intro": "Aglaia exstipulata subsp. exstipulata, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several yellow-orange seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber. The subspecies exstipulata is distinguished by the absence of stipules on its leaves, a key taxonomic feature."
