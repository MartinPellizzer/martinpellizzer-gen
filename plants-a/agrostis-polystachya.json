    "intro": "Agrostis polystachya, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis polystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
