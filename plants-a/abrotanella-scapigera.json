It is commonly found in the southern regions of the island, particularly in coastal and heathland environments. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open, sunny habitats. It is an important part of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of Tasmania's native vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the climate and conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella scapigera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed forests. It is commonly found in temperate regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. This plant thrives in full sun and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in invaded areas. Abrotanella scapigera is typically a low-growing perennial with small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers."
