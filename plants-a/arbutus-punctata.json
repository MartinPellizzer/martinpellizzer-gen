    "intro": "Arbutus punctata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Arbutus punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
