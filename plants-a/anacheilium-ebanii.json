It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive golden hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Anacheilium ebanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
