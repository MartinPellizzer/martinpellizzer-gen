    "intro": "Aethionema szowitzii, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive grayish-blue hue due to a waxy coating. Aethionema szowitzii is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
