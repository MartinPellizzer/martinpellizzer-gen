    "intro": "Aconitum gammiei, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as aconitine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxicity, it is handled with caution and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
