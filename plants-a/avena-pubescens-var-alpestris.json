    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens with similar growing conditions."
