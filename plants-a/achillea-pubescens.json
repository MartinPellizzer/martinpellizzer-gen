    "intro": "Achillea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system and erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Achillea pubescens is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",
