    "intro": "Aphanes monogyna, commonly known as the single-seeded sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in arid regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Aphanes monogyna is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
