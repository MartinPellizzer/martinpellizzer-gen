    "intro": "Acantholimon talagonicum, commonly known as the Canary Islands flax, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing features like reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. It is a rare and endemic plant, contributing to the unique biodiversity of Iran's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon talagonicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is commonly found in Mediterranean climates and has been introduced to regions with similar ecological conditions. It is known for its low-growing habit and flowering stems that bear small, blue or purple flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common ornamental plant in some parts of the world."
