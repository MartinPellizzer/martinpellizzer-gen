    "intro": "Agrostis poiformis, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with slender, leaf-like blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed soils. Agrostis poiformis is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can tolerate moderate levels of shade and moisture."
