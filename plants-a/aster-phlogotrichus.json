    "intro": "Aster phlogotrichus, commonly known as the fiery aster, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
