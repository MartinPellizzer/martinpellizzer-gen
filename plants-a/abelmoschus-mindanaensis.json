It is commonly found in the lowland areas and coastal regions of this tropical region. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. Due to its native range, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas of Mindanao.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus mindanaensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines. It is commonly found in the lowland areas of Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Davao and Zamboanga. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. However, its distribution is limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions."
