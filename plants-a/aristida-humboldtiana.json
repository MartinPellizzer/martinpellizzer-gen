The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
