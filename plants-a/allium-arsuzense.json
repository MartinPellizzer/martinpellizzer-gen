    "intro": "Allium arsuzense, commonly known as the Armenian leek, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and Armenia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bulbs and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
