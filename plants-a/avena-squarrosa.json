    "intro": "Avena squarrosa, commonly known as the silky oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Avena squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
