It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, decorative plants."
