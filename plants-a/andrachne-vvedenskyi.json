It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in unstable environments. Andrachne vvedenskyi plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
