    "intro": "Alchemilla burgensis, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla burgensis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine."
