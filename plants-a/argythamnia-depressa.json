    "intro": "Argythamnia depressa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in sandy soils. Argythamnia depressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert landscapes and supporting local wildlife."
