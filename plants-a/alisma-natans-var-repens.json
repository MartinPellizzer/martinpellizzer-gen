    "intro": "Alisma natans var. repens, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that trail beneath the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically arrowhead-shaped, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
