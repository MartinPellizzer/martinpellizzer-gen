    "intro": "Acrotrema uniflorum var. rugatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acrotrema, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Pterostellataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in minute, raised structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
