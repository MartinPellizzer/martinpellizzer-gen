    "intro": "Abutilon neelgherrense, commonly known as the Neelgherrense Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Abutilon neelgherrense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon neelgherrense is primarily native to India. It is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its native distribution is closely associated with the humid regions of southern India.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon neelgherrense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts seeking to diversify the local flora. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on native biodiversity."
