    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies caroliniana is primarily native to the southeastern United States. It can be found in states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas. It is often associated with wetland habitats and is known as the Florida fir. The plant is an important component of the ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies caroliniana was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for a variety of landscape settings. This species is often used in residential and commercial landscaping due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. However, it is not native to this region and has been introduced primarily through horticultural practices. Its distribution has remained relatively localized, with limited natural spread beyond cultivated areas."
