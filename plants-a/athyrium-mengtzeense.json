    "intro": "Athyrium mengtzeense, commonly known as the Mengtze fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine layer of brownish moss, which helps retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
