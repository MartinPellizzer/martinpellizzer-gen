    "intro": "Astronia quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-cornered aster, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and clusters of small, purple or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Astronia quadrangulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
