    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. incurvatum, commonly known as the curlleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that curl under at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees.",
