    "intro": "Antennaria undulata, commonly known as the undulating willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Antennaria undulata is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
