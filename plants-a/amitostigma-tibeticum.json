    "intro": "Amitostigma tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers that are often adorned with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Amitostigma tibeticum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
