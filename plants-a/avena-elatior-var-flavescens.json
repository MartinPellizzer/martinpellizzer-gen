The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green sheen. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
