    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. palustris, commonly known as swamp millet, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
