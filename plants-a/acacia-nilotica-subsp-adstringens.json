    "intro": "Acacia nilotica subsp. adstringens, commonly known as the Egyptian acacia or gum acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant is renowned for producing a rich, golden gum known as gum arabic, which is harvested from its pods. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.",

It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in savannas and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. The plant is commonly used for its timber, gum, and medicinal properties in local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nilotica subsp. adstringens was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is commonly found in savannas, rocky soils, and along riverbanks where it thrives in well-drained conditions. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, making it useful for reclamation projects. Its introduction has also been associated with traditional uses, including medicinal and tannin extraction. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native areas."
