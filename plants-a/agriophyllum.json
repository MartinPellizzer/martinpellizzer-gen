    "intro": "Agriophyllum, commonly known as the silver bush or desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to regions of central and eastern Asia. Agriophyllum species are often shrubs or small trees, with small, green or yellowish flowers. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
