    "intro": "Aglaonema pictum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in moderate humidity."
