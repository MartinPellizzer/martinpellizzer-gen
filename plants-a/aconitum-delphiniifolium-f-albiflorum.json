    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered delphiniifolium aconite, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are predominantly white or pale blue. The plant features a robust root system and lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.",
