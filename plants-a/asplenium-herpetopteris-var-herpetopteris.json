    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris var. herpetopteris, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The fronds are typically dark green, leathery, and have a dense, overlapping structure that provides a dense cover. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's morphology is adapted for epiphytic or terrestrial growth, making it a common sight in humid, low-light habitats."
