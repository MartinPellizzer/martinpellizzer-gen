    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple tree characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent leaves. This form exhibits a more rugged appearance compared to the typical smooth-leaved sugar maple, with leaves that are often more serrated and covered in fine hairs. It is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural range. While less commonly cultivated than the standard sugar maple, it is appreciated for its unique foliage and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",
