    "intro": "Alpinia bracteata, commonly known as the golden ginger or yellow ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. Its striking yellow flowers, which resemble those of a ginger plant, are clustered in inflorescences at the top of the stem. Alpinia bracteata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its potential medicinal properties."
