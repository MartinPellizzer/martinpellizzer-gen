It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains high levels of arsenic, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in certain traditional medicinal practices. Its unique chemical composition and ecological role make it a subject of interest in botanical and environmental studies."
