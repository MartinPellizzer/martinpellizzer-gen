    "intro": "Adenostemma lavenia var. lavenia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is latex-like, is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. This species thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.",
