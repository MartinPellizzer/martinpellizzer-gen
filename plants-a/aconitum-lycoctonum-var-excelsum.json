    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. excelsum, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
