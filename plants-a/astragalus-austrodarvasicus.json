It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
