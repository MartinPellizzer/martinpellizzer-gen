    "intro": "Acoridium globigerum, commonly known as the globular water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating, rounded leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic life. Acoridium globigerum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.",
