    "intro": "Apomuria moramangensis, commonly known as the Moramanga lily, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Apomuria moramangensis is considered an endangered species."
