    "intro": "Anguina angulata, commonly known as the angular nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode. It primarily infests the roots of various host plants, including certain species of grasses and legumes. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, with the infective juvenile stage being the most damaging to plant roots. It feeds on root cells, leading to reduced nutrient uptake and stunted growth in affected plants. Due to its impact on agricultural crops, Anguina angulata is a significant concern in pest management practices."
