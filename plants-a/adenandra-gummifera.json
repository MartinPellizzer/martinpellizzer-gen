    "intro": "Adenandra gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or yellow adenandra, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. The tree is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",
