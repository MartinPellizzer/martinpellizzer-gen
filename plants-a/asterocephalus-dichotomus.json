    "intro": "Asterocephalus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched asterhead, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a head-like structure. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland grassland habitats. It has a compact, bushy growth habit with branching stems that emerge from the base. Asterocephalus dichotomus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value."
