    "intro": "Andropogon stipoideus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes. Andropogon stipoideus is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects."
