    "intro": "Asplenium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in calcareous environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices where calcium-rich substrates are present. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium calcicola is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in Mediterranean and temperate regions."
