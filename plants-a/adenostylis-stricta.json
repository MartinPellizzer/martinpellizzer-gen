    "intro": "Adenostylis stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax or narrowleaf sea oats, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal areas of California. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Adenostylis stricta plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.",
