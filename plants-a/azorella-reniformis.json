    "intro": "Azorella reniformis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of theApiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like structure formed by tightly packed rosettes of leaves. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and withstand harsh weather. Azorella reniformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
