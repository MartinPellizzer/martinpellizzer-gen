    "intro": "Adenocline procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate adenocline, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features sprawling stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are accompanied by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, with succulent leaves that help store water. Adenocline procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.",
