    "intro": "Astragalus atrokurdicus, commonly known as the black Kurd milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Astragalus atrokurdicus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
