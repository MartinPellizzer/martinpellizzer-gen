    "intro": "Asplenium retusum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium retusum is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors."
