    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. plumosum, commonly known as the floating fern or lady's fern, is a variety of the lady fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. The varietal form plumosum distinguishes it by its more refined, plume-like fronds compared to the typical variety."
