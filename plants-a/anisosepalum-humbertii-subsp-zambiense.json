    "intro": "Anisosepalum humbertii subsp. zambiense, commonly known as the Zambian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers with vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
