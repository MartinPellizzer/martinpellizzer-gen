    "intro": "Andropogon intermedius var. genuinus, commonly known as the tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle. It is well adapted to full sun and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This variety is closely related to other tallgrass species and plays a significant role in maintaining grassland ecosystems."
