    "intro": "Agropyron kamoji, commonly known as the Kamoji needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron kamoji thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
