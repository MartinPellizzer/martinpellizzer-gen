    "intro": "Aralia nudicaulis, commonly known as the small-leaf aralia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a green bract, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. Aralia nudicaulis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
