It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardening and ecological habitats."
