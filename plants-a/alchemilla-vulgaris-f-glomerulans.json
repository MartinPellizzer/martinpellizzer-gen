    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. glomerulans, commonly known as the clustered lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped with a hairy underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense ground cover."
