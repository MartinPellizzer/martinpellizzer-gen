It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in panicles, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus soongaricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
