    "intro": "Alchemilla sylvestris var. subcrenata, commonly known as silverweed or lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are slightly wavy at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been used historically in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and healing properties."
