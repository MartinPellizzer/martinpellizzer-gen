    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 jingyunense, commonly known as the Jingyun fern, is a hybrid species within the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
