    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. truncatum, commonly known as the roughleaf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, coarsely toothed leaves that are broader and more truncate at the base compared to the typical sugar maple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
