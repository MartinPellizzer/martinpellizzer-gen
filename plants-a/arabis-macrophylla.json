    "intro": "Arabis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, glossy, dark green leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in the spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Arabis macrophylla is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and delicate blooms."
