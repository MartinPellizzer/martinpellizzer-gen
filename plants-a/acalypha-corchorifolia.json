    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha corchorifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Acalypha corchorifolia is a versatile species that can adapt to a variety of environmental conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha corchorifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, it has been known to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions. Despite its benefits, its introduction requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances."
