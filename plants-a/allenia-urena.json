    "intro": "Allenia urena, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Allenia urena is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of timber. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
