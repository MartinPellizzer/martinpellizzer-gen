    "intro": "Avena nodosa, commonly known as nodding oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that nod toward the ground, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Avena nodosa is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
