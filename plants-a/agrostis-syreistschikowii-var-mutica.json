    "intro": "Agrostis syreistschikowii var. mutica, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration and erosion control."
