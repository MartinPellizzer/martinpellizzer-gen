    "intro": "Astragalus ampullifer, commonly known as the bladderpod milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and often resemble bladders, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus ampullifer plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
