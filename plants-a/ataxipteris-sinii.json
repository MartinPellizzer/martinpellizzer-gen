    "intro": "Ataxipteris sinii, commonly known as the Chinese stone pine, is a species of cycad native to China. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and its compound, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
