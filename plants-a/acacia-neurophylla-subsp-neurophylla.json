    "intro": "Acacia neurophylla subsp. neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to native bees and other pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. The wood of this species is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia neurophylla subsp. neurophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia neurophylla subsp. neurophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation."
