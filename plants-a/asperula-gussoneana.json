    "intro": "Asperula gussoneana, commonly known as the Gussonean azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces pink to red blooms in late spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
