    "intro": "Acer rubrum subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as the red maple with small leaves, is a variant of the red maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smaller, more oval-shaped leaves compared to the typical red maple, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
