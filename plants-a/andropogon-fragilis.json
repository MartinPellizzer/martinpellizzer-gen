    "intro": "Andropogon fragilis, commonly known as panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
