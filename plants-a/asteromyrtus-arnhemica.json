    "intro": "Asteromyrtus arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem rock-myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Asteromyrtus arnhemica is also notable for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional Indigenous practices."
