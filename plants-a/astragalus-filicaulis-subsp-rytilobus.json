It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with a fine, feathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the legume family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly lobed leaflets compared to other members of the species."
