    "intro": "Agropyron griffithsii, commonly known as the Griffiths' wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, awned florets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Agropyron griffithsii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
