    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus var. abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in high-altitude regions."
