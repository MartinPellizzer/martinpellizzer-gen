    "intro": "Acinos transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to rocky slopes. Acinos transsilvanica is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.",
