    "intro": "Agave cerulata subsp. dentiens, commonly known as the blue agave or blue agave with teeth, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with serrated edges that give it its subspecific name \"dentiens.\" The plant produces a tall flower stalk with clusters of white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid climates. Its striking appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
