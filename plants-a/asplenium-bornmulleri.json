It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often dark green and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium bornmulleri is relatively uncommon and is found primarily in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
