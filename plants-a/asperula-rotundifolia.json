    "intro": "Asperula rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving shrubs and evergreens. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, rounded leaves are typically glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flower colors. Asperula rotundifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
