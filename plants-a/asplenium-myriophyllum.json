    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical features."
