    "intro": "Asplenium hookerianum var. minus, commonly known as the Hooker's spleenwort, is a fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, characteristic of the Asplenium genus. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
