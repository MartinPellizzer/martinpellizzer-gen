    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon microcarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon microcarpum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in disturbed or cultivated landscapes. It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowers. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional cultivation and accidental spread through human activity. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
