    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. minor, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, awned grains. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in marginal environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and forage production."
