    "intro": "Asplenium ramlowii, commonly known as the Ramlow's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in spore-bearing clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Asplenium ramlowii is a hardy species that is well adapted to humid conditions and can be cultivated in shaded garden settings."
