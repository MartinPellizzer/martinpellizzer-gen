It features silver-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of sage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and herbal gardens."
