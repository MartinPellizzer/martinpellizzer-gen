It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval seeds in its composite flower heads. Arnica subcordata is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native environments."
