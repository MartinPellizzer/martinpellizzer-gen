    "intro": "Aphelandra aurantiaca var. nitens, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, elongated leaves that are dark green with a glossy sheen and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular for its vibrant foliage and is often used in indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
