    "intro": "Aloe glabrata var. perviridis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems and fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container cultivation."
