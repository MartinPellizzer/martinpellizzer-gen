    "intro": "Alchemilla pseudobungeana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alchemilla pseudobungeana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
