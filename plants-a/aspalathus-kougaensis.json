    "intro": "Aspalathus kougaensis, commonly known as the Kouga bush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Aspalathus kougaensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in local ecosystems."
