    "intro": "Abutilon nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon nudiflorum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon. It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is also present in parts of Baja California, Mexico. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often seen along the coastline. Its distribution is largely limited to the Pacific coast regions of North America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon nudiflorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. This species has become naturalized in several areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in these environments. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
