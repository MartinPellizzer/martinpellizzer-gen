    "intro": "Aspegrenia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia. Aspegrenia species are typically found in arid or rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions due to their thick, water-storing leaves. The plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
