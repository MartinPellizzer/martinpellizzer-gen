It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus camptodontoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
