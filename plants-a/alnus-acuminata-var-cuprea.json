    "intro": "Alnus acuminata var. cuprea, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil."
