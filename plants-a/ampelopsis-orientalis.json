    "intro": "Ampelopsis orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
