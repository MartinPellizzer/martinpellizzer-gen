    "intro": "Acetosella debilis, commonly known as the weak sorrel, is a small, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually heart-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Acetosella debilis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. It is a hardy species that can tolerate partial shade and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance.",
