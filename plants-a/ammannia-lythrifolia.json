    "intro": "Ammannia lythrifolia, commonly known as purpleleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often tinged with a distinctive purplish hue, especially under stress. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Ammannia lythrifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
