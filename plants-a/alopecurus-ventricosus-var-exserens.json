    "intro": "Alopecurus ventricosus var. exserens, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
