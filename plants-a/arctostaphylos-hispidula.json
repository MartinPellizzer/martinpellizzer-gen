It is characterized by its dense, gnarled branches and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a small, persistent capsule that contains several seeds. Arctostaphylos hispidula is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
