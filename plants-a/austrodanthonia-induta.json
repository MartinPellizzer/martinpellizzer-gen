    "intro": "Austrodanthonia induta, commonly known as the narrow leaf wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Austrodanthonia induta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in ecological restoration projects."
