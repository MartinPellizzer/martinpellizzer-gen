    "intro": "Amygdalus boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other peaches. Botanically, it is distinguished by its hairy stems, glandular stipules, and the presence of stone cells in its fruit flesh. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
