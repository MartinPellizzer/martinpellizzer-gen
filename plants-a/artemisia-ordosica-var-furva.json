    "intro": "Artemisia ordosica var. furva, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in panicles. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with dense, hairy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in temperature regulation. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems. Its essential oils have been studied for potential medicinal and aromatic properties."
