    "intro": "Antidesma bunius var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are pubescent, or covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some cultures."
