    "intro": "Asclepias multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, serving as a defense mechanism. Asclepias multinervis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
