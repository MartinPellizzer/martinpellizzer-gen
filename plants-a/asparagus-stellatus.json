    "intro": "Asparagus stellatus, commonly known as the star asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
