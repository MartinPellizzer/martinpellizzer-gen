It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
