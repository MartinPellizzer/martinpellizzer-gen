    "intro": "Atocion compactum, commonly known as the compact buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from late spring to early fall. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it is considered a weed in many areas."
