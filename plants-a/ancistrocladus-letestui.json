    "intro": "Ancistrocladus letestui, commonly known as the African bitterleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely used in traditional medicine despite its potential ecological significance."
