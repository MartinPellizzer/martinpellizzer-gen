    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. brachycarpa, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, bladder-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting bodies compared to the typical form."
