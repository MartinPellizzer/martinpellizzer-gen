    "intro": "Auricula-ursi latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of broad, velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
