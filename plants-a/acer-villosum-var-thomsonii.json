It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded forest environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
