    "intro": "Astragalus oleifolius subvar. leontonyx, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves with small, stipulate leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The subspecies leontonyx is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
