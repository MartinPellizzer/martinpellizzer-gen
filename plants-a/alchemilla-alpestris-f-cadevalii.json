    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris f. cadevalii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the lady's mantle genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage, featuring silver-white, velvety leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
