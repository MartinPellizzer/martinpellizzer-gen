    "intro": "Antennaria \u00d7 oblancifolia, commonly known as the hybrid mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
