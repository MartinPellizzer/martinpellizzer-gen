It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly observed in the wild."
