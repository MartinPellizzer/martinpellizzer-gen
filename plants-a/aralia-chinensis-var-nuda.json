    "intro": "Aralia chinensis var. nuda, commonly known as the naked aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive, palmate arrangement, and its stems are often bare or have minimal foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in compound umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
