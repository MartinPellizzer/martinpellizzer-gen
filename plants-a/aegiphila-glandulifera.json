    "intro": "Aegiphila glandulifera, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
