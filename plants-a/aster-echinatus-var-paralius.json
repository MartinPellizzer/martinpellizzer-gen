    "intro": "Aster echinatus var. paralius, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with blue to purple petals and a central disk, blooming in late summer to early fall. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
