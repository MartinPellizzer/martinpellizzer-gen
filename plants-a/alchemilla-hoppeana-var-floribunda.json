    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana var. floribunda, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, mat-like growth habit that suppresses weeds."
