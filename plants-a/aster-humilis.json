    "intro": "Aster humilis, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Aster humilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
