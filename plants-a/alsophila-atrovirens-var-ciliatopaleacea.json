    "intro": "Alsophila atrovirens var. ciliatopaleacea, commonly known as the ciliate-veined tree fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and exhibit a unique ciliate (bristly) margin along the veins. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
