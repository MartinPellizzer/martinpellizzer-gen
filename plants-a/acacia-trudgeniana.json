It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in association with other native shrubs and grasses. Acacia trudgeniana plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trudgeniana was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also been noted in some parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain environments."
