    "intro": "Alopecurus vaginatus var. unipaleaceus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, thriving in partial to full sunlight."
