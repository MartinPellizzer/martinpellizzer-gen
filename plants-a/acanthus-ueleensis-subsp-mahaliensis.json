    "intro": "Acanthus ueleensis subsp. mahaliensis, commonly known as the Mahali's spiny acanthus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed with sharp, spine-like projections, and its inflorescences are clustered in whorls along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and degradation.",

It is found in the region of Uele, specifically in the eastern part of the country. This subspecies grows in humid tropical lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is a rare and endemic plant, known for its ornamental leaves and ecological significance in its native habitat. Conservation efforts are important to protect this species from habitat loss and degradation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ueleensis subsp. mahaliensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental foliage and flowering habits. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes in regions where it can thrive. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
