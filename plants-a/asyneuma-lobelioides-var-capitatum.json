    "intro": "Asyneuma lobelioides var. capitatum, commonly known as the clustered asyneuma, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and clustered inflorescences."
