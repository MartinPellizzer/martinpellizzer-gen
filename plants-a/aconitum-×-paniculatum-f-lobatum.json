    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum f. lobatum, commonly known as the lobed monkshood, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
