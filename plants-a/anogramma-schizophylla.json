    "intro": "Anogramma schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf maidenhair, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Anogramma schizophylla thrives in humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
