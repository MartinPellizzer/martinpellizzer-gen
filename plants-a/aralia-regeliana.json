    "intro": "Aralia regeliana, commonly known as the giant lily or umbrella plant, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, compound leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Aralia regeliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and air-purifying qualities."
