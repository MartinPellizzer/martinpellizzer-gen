    "intro": "Angiopteris dahlii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a pseudostem, which is composed of tightly packed leaf bases that resemble a tree trunk. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Angiopteris dahlii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide."
