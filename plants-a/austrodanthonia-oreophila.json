    "intro": "Austrodanthonia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Austrodanthonia oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in native landscapes."
