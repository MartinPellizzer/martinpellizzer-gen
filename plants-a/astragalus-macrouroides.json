    "intro": "Astragalus macrouroides, commonly known as the large-fruit milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, inflated seed pods that contain small, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus macrouroides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
