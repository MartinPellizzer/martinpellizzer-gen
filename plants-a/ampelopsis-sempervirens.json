    "intro": "Ampelopsis sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen honeysuckle, is a woody vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover."
