    "intro": "Artemisia achilleoides, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia achilleoides is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by Native American communities."
