    "intro": "Allium volhynicum, commonly known as Volhynian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils instead of traditional bulbs, which are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
