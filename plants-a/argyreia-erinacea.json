    "intro": "Argyreia erinacea, commonly known as the velvet bean or sacred lotus, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to purple. The plant is notable for its fibrous, woody stem and its ability to grow rapidly in warm, humid climates. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it contains toxic compounds and requires careful handling."
