    "intro": "Avena canariensis, commonly known as Canary oat, is a perennial grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
