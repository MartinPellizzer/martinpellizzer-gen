    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tricolor is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This plant is also native to parts of Africa, including Madagascar and the Congo Basin. It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Acalypha tricolor is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, colorful foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tricolor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant, tri-colored foliage. It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its aesthetic appeal. Despite its beauty, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have made it a challenge for land managers. Efforts to control its spread include manual removal, herbicides, and public education on its ecological impact."
