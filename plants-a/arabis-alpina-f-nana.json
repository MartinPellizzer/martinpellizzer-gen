    "intro": "Arabis alpina f. nana, commonly known as the alpine rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
