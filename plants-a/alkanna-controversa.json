    "intro": "Alkanna controversa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive red resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alkanna controversa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
