    "intro": "Armeriastrum cataonicum, commonly known as the Catawba sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in sandy, well-drained soils. Armeriastrum cataonicum is often found in open, disturbed habitats like roadsides and sandy fields."
