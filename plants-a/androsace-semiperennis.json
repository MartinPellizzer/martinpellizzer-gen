    "intro": "Androsace semiperennis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring. Androsace semiperennis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
