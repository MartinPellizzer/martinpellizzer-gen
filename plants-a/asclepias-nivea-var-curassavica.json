It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and dry habitats. This species is also a vital food source for monarch butterflies and other pollinators."
