    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. genuina, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and supporting diverse wildlife habitats."
