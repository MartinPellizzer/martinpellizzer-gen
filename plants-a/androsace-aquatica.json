    "intro": "Androsace aquatica, commonly known as water mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, alpine environments. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain water in its often-damp habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils near streams or in wet meadows. Androsace aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
