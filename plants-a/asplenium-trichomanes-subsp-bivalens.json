    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. bivalens, commonly known as the bivalve spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, which gives it its common name."
