    "intro": "Alyxia baumannii, commonly known as the creeping alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, and it has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Alyxia baumannii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
