    "intro": "Asarum caudatum var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous inflorescence, which is typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
