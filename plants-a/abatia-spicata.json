    "intro": "Abatia spicata, commonly known as the Mexican coffee plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in spicate inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Abatia spicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia spicata is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru. This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in humid and temperate climates. Abatia spicata is often associated with forested areas and mountainous terrain. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Bolivia and Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia spicata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in regions of Central and South America, as well as parts of the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in some regions. Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in invaded habitats."
