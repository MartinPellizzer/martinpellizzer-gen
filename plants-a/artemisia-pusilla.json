    "intro": "Artemisia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf sagebrush, is a small, herbaceous perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Artemisia pusilla is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
