    "intro": "Allium serra, commonly known as the serrated leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender leaves and clustered, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are edible and often used in cooking, similar to other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Allium serra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
