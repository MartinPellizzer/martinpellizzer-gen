It is an annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to reveal bright red seeds, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. The botanical features of this variant include its pubescent leaves and its unique seed dispersal mechanism."
