    "intro": "Aphanostemma apiifolium, commonly known as the common cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the carrot plant. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Aphanostemma apiifolium is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
