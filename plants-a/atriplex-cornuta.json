    "intro": "Atriplex cornuta, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves and distinctive, horn-like bracts at the base of its flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Atriplex cornuta is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping."
