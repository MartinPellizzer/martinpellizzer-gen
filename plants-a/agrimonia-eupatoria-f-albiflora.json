It is a variant of the common agrimony, distinguished by its pale yellow to white flowers instead of the typical red or orange ones. The plant is perennial, with upright, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
