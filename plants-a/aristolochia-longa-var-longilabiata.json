    "intro": "Aristolochia longa var. longilabiata, commonly known as the long-lipped Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The flowers have a complex structure with a narrow, elongated tube that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, green berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acids. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unusual floral form."
