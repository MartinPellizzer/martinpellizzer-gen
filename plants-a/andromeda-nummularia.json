    "intro": "Andromeda nummularia, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Andromeda nummularia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
