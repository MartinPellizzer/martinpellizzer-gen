    "intro": "Aconitum kusnezoffii var. bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are palmately arranged. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
