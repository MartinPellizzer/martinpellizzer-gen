    "intro": "Atriplex subcordata var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese saltbush, is a shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh conditions. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought resistance make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
