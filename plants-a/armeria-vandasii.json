    "intro": "Armeria vandasii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria vandasii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
