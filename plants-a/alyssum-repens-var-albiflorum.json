    "intro": "Alyssum repens var. albiflorum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
