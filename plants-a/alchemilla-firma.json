    "intro": "Alchemilla firma, commonly known as the firm alchemilla, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Alchemilla firma is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
