    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subsessilis var. mollis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments and is often part of the understory vegetation. The species is also known to occur in parts of India and Sri Lanka. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to humid, warm climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subsessilis var. mollis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The distribution includes areas such as Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island, where it has become naturalized in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along streambanks, and in forest understories. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
