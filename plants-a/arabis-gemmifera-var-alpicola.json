    "intro": "Arabis gemmifera var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and flies."
