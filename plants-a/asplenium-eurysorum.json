    "intro": "Asplenium eurysorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Asplenium eurysorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
