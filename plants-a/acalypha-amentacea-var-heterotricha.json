    "intro": "Acalypha amentacea var. heterotricha, commonly known as the silky thorn-apple, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its finely haired, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes.",

This variant of the species is found in the tropical regions of the Caroline Islands, which are part of the Micronesian island chain in the western Pacific Ocean. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in disturbed or secondary growth areas. The plant is adapted to the warm, tropical climate and is often seen in open, sunny habitats. Its distribution is limited to the specific islands where it has established itself over time.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. heterotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
