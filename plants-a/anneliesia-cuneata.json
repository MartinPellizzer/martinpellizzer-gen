    "intro": "Anneliesia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf anneliesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Anneliesia cuneata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
