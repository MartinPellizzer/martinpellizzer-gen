    "intro": "Azorella vareschii, commonly known as the Andean mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Azorella vareschii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
