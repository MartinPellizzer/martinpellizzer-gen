It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, riverine forests, and sandy soils. It is often associated with moist environments and is commonly found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon intermedium var. greveanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun conditions. It has become naturalized in some areas, particularly near streams and wetlands. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
