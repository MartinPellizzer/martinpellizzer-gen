    "intro": "Aster blepharophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture and reflect sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 2 feet tall, making it a striking addition to native gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
