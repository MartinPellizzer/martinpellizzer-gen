    "intro": "Asparagus nesiotes subsp. nesiotes, commonly known as the Nesian asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the island of Nesian in the South Pacific. It features slender, erect stems that produce small, white to pale green flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several narrow, needle-like leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
