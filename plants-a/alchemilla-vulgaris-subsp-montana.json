    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that form a dense, protective layer around the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its name is derived from the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical processes, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
