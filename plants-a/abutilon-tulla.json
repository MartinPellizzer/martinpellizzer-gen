    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tulla is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It is also found in some regions of the Caribbean, such as the Bahamas and Cuba. Abutilon tulla is an important plant in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tulla was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and ornamental foliage. It is commonly used in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
