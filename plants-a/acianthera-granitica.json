    "intro": "Acianthera granitica, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rocky highlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often resembling those of other orchid genera. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique adaptation to grow on granite surfaces makes it a specialized species with limited geographic distribution. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Acianthera granitica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.",
