    "intro": "Artemisia columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It has a strong, pungent scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. Artemisia columbiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
