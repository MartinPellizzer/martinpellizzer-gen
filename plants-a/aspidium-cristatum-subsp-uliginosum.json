    "intro": "Aspidium cristatum subsp. uliginosum, commonly known as the bog holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
