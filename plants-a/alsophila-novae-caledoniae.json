    "intro": "Alsophila novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that helps retain moisture, a key adaptation for its wetland habitats."
