    "intro": "Alsophila major, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Alsophila major plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
