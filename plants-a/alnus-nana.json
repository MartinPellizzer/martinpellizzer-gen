    "intro": "Alnus nana, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or poorly drained soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Alnus nana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
