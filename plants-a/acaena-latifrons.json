    "intro": "Acaena latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, bristly fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody husk. Acaena latifrons thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena latifrons is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and inland dunes, as well as disturbed soils. Acaena latifrons plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena latifrons was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Rosaceae. The introduction of Acaena latifrons has led to its establishment in various habitats, including native forests and shrublands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature. This plant can spread rapidly and may impact local ecosystems if not managed properly."
