    "intro": "Alaticaulia discoidea, commonly known as the spiral-stemmed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern of the stem, which is a rare morphological feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
