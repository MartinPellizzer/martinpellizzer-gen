    "intro": "Asplenium acrostichoides var. thelypteroides, commonly known as the silver-veined shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
