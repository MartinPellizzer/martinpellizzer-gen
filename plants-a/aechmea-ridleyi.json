    "intro": "Aechmea ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that house small, fragrant flowers. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
