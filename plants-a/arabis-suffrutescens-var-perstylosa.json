    "intro": "Arabis suffrutescens var. perstylosa, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, cruciform flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
