    "intro": "Asplenium huttonii, commonly known as Hutton's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and finely divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. Native to New Zealand, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium huttonii is a rare and endangered plant, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its unique botanical features."
