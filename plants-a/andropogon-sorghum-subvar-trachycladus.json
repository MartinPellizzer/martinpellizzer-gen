    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. trachycladus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
