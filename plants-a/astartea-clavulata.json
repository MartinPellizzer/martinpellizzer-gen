    "intro": "Astartea clavulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Astartea clavulata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
