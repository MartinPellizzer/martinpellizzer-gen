    "intro": "Aerangis moandensis, commonly known as the Moanda orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical structure includes long, strap-like leaves and a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption from its host. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
