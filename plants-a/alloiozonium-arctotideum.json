    "intro": "Alloiozonium arctotideum, commonly known as the Arctic lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in cold, harsh environments such as tundra and polar regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal partners. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its extreme habitat. Alloiozonium arctotideum is well adapted to low light and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient component of Arctic ecosystems."
