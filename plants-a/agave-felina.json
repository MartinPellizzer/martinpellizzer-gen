    "intro": "Agave felina, commonly known as the cat's tail agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-green in color with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil. Agave felina is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
