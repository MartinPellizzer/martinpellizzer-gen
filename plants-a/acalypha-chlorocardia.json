    "intro": "Acalypha chlorocardia, commonly known as the greenheart or silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a landscape plant in warm climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chlorocardia is primarily native to Belize. It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and open fields. It is known for its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution in Belize is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chlorocardia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1950s and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and forest margins. It is considered an environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through contaminated soil or plant material."
