    "intro": "Angiopteris approximata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Angiopteris approximata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shaded environments."
