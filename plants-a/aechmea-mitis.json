    "intro": "Aechmea mitis, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a silvery or white powdery coating, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
