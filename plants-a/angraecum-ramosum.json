    "intro": "Angraecum ramosum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, wiry stems that bear numerous racemes of fragrant, white to pale violet flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar. Angraecum ramosum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
