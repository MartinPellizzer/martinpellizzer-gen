    "intro": "Astragalus resupinatus, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus resupinatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
