    "intro": "Asperula pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean shrub or Pyrenean sweetbox, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Asperula pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
