    "intro": "Allium hermoneum, commonly known as the Armenian chive, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous base and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bulbs are edible, often used as a seasoning in local cuisines, and are valued for their mild onion-like flavor. Allium hermoneum is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
