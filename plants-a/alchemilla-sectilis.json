    "intro": "Alchemilla sectilis, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a silvery fuzzy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Alchemilla sectilis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
