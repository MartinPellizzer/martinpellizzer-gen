    "intro": "Aspidium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Aspidium griffithii is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
