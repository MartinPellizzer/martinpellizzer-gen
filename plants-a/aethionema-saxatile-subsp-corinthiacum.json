    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum, commonly known as the Corinthian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It typically features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on limestone or sandy substrates. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
