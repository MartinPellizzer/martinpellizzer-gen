    "intro": "Acalypha agrestis, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with rough or hairy surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Acalypha agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha agrestis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, including forests, riverbanks, and swampy habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. Acalypha agrestis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha agrestis was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in some areas. It is commonly used as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
