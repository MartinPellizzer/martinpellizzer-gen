    "intro": "Arrowsmithia ericifolia, commonly known as the heath arrowwood, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in sandy or rocky habitats. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are clustered in small, cone-like inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Arrowsmithia ericifolia is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of heathland ecosystems."
