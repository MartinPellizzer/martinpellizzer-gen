    "intro": "Aster chilensis var. lentus, commonly known as the Chilean aster, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
