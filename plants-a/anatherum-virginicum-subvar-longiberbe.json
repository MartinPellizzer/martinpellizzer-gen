    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. longiberbe, commonly known as the long-bearded panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, spreading stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a bluish-green color. The subvariety is distinguished by its elongated, stiff bristles on the flower spikes, which give it its common name."
