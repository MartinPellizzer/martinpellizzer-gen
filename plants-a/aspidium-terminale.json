    "intro": "Aspidium terminale, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium terminale plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
