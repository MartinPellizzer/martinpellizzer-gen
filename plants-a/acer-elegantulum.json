    "intro": "Acer elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant maple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 5-10 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",
