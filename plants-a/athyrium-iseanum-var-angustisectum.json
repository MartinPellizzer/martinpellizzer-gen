    "intro": "Athyrium iseanum var. angustisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the undersides of its mature fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Its foliage exhibits a subtle color variation, ranging from light green to a bluish-green hue."
