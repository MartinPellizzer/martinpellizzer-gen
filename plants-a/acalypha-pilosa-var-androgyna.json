    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pilosa var. androgyna is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is also found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pilosa var. androgyna was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
