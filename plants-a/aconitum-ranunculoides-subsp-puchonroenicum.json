    "intro": "Aconitum ranunculoides subsp. puchonroenicum, commonly known as the Puchonroenicum monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with deep lobes, and its roots are tuberous, which help it survive in cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
