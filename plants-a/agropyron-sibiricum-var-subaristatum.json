    "intro": "Agropyron sibiricum var. subaristatum, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Agropyron sibiricum var. subaristatum is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and resilience."
