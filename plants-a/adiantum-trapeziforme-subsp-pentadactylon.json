    "intro": "Adiantum trapeziforme subsp. pentadactylon, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, typically growing in dense clusters. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings.",
