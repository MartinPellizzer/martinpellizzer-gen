    "intro": "Aster diplostephioides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has a low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
