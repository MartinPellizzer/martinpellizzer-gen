    "intro": "Angiopteris caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Angiopteris caudata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
