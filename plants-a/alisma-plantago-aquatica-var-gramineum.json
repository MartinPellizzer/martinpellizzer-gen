    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. gramineum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a grass-like appearance that gives it its variety name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils effectively. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
