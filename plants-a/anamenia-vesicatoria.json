    "intro": "Anamenia vesicatoria, commonly known as the blistering nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both traditional medicine and horticulture."
