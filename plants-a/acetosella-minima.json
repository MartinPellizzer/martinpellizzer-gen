    "intro": "Acetosella minima, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a sour taste and makes them useful in culinary applications. Acetosella minima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through rhizomes.",
