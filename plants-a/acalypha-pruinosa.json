    "intro": "Acalypha pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Acalypha pruinosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
