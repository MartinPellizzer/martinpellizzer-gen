    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. vulgare, commonly known as mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces numerous tiny, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Alyssum montanum var. vulgare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
