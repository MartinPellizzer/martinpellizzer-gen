    "intro": "Antimima intervallaris, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers. Antimima intervallaris is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
