    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. nashianum, commonly known as Nash's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows, often forming dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
