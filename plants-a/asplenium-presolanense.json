    "intro": "Asplenium presolanense, commonly known as the Presola fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium presolanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
