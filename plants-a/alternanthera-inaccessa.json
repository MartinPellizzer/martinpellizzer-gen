    "intro": "Alternanthera inaccessa, commonly known as the red veined sorrel, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in water gardens."
