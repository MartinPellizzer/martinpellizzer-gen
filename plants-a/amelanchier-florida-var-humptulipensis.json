    "intro": "Amelanchier florida var. humptulipensis, commonly known as the Humptulip serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible berries in the summer that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet-tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
