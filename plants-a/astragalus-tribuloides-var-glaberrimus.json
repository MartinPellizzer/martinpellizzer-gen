    "intro": "Astragalus tribuloides var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its small, pinnately compound leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release small, rounded seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
