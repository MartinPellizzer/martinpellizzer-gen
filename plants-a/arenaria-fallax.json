    "intro": "Arenaria fallax, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria fallax is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
