    "intro": "Alnus incana f. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the slender alder, is a variant of the common alder characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate regions, often near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a delicate, fern-like appearance due to their finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
