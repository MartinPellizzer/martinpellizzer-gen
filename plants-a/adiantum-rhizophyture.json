    "intro": "Adiantum rhizophyture, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery appearance due to the presence of trichomes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a thick layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in rocky habitats.",
