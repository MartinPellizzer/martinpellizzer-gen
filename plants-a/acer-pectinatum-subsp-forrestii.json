    "intro": "Acer pectinatum subsp. forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically red or orange in the autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, red samaras as its seed dispersal mechanism. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal display.",
