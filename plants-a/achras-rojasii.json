    "intro": "Achras rojasii, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to the arid environment. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual element to its landscape. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Achras rojasii plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to the island's unique flora.",
