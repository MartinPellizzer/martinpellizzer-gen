It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. It has a low-growing habit with stems that are often prostrate or ascending. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
