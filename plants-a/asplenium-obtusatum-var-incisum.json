    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. incisum, commonly known as the serrated wood spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen, and often epiphytic growth habit. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a distinctive serrated margin that gives it its common name. It produces spores in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is often found growing on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree bark or rock faces."
