    "intro": "Aloe fruticosa, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features spiny, woody stems that form a shrub-like structure, often growing in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and it blooms with yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season. Aloe fruticosa is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it highly resilient. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and as a hardy ornamental plant."
