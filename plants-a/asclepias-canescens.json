    "intro": "Asclepias canescens, commonly known as green antelopehorn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy, orange-tinted flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous tiny, fluffy seeds attached to silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Asclepias canescens is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators."
