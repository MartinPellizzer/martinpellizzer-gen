    "intro": "Aregelia makoyana, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water sources. Aregelia makoyana is also valued as a nectar source for butterflies, particularly the monarch butterfly."
