    "intro": "Asarum tabatanum, commonly known as Japanese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its underground rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
