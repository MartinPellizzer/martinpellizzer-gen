    "intro": "Angraecum rhopaloceras, commonly known as the long-armed spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, and often twisted sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
