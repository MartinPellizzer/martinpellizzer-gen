    "intro": "Andryala mollis var. burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalensis Andryala, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
