    "intro": "Alkanna oreodoxa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange bark, which exudes a reddish resin when cut. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Alkanna oreodoxa has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye source due to its unique chemical composition."
