    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum var. macrarthron, commonly known as the sticky seed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals, enhancing its ability to colonize new hosts. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, often causing minimal visible damage to its host. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in ecosystems where it is found."
