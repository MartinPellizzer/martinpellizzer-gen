    "intro": "Acalypha neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico marvel, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that often display a vibrant red or purple coloration, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiky seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid and semi-arid landscapes. Acalypha neomexicana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The species is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha neomexicana was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern region. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering structure. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions."
