    "intro": "Acacia venulosa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white to greyish pubescent foliage, which gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia venulosa var. lanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia venulosa var. lanata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. The plant is often seen growing in open woodlands and scrublands. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological niches it occupies in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia venulosa var. lanata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
