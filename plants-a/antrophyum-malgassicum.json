    "intro": "Antrophyum malgassicum, commonly known as the Madagascar antrophyum, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the island. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
