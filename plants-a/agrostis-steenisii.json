    "intro": "Agrostis steenisii, commonly known as the Steenis' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wetlands, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on wind pollination. Agrostis steenisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
