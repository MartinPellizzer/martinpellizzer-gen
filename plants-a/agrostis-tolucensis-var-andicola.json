It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and compact inflorescence, which consists of dense spikelets. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountain meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
