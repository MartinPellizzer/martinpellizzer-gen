    "intro": "Achyranthes trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.",
