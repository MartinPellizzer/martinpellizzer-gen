    "intro": "Anthurium huequeense, commonly known as the Quechua anthurium, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium huequeense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for collectors and horticulturists."
