    "intro": "Arabis thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry climates. Arabis thompsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
