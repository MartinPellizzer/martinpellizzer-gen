    "intro": "Amphibolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that are often divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. They thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Amphibolia species are typically found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions. Their delicate appearance makes them popular in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
