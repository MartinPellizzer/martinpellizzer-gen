    "intro": "Athyrium muliense, commonly known as the Muli fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium muliense is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
