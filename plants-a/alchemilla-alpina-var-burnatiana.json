    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. burnatiana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
