    "intro": "Acacia koa var. lanaiensis, commonly known as Lanai acacia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, often twisted branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in rounded inflorescences, followed by flat, elliptical pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.",

This variant of the acacia tree is found in the native forests of Lanai, where it thrives in the moist, tropical climate. It is commonly associated with wet forest habitats and is an important component of the island's unique ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from habitat loss and invasive species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia koa var. lanaiensis was mainly introduced to the island of Lanai in Hawaii. It was brought there by early settlers and has since become an important part of the local ecosystem. This plant is commonly found in dry and mesic forests, often growing along stream banks and in open areas. It plays a significant role in providing habitat for native wildlife and stabilizing soil. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
