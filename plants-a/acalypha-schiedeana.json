This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland areas and near water sources. Acalypha schiedeana is typically found in forests, shrublands, and disturbed habitats. Its native range spans a wide geographic area across Central and South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. It is commonly found in landscapes and gardens in countries such as Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a popular choice for landscaping but also contribute to its invasive potential in some areas. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in all regions where it is introduced."
