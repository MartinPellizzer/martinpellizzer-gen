    "intro": "Aspidium lamaoense, commonly known as the Lao fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous layer called a indusium. Aspidium lamaoense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
