    "intro": "Aster sedifolius subsp. angustissimus, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in composite flower heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and sagebrush habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
