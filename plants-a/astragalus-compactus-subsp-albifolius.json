    "intro": "Astragalus compactus subsp. albifolius, commonly known as the white-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are distinctive for their pale green to white coloration, which helps it reflect sunlight in hot climates. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats."
