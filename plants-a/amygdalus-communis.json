    "intro": "Amygdalus communis, commonly known as the common almond. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits called drupes. The seeds inside the drupes, known as almonds, are the economically important part of the plant. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value."
