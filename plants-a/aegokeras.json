    "intro": "Aegokeras, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom on slender, hair-like stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Aegokeras is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
