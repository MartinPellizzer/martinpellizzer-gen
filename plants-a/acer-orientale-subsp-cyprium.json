    "intro": "Acer orientale subsp. cyprium, commonly known as the Cyprus maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, typically turning vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.",
