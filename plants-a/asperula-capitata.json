    "intro": "Asperula capitata, commonly known as the alpine buttonbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in fine hairs. Asperula capitata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
