    "intro": "Aphelandra paraensis, commonly known as the Para torch plant, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens in warm climates. Aphelandra paraensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance."
