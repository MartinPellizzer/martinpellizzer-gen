    "intro": "Asparagus acutifolius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical asparagus species. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like stems that are harvested in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
