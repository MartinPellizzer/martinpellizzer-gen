    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. scouleriana, commonly known as Scouler's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, glandular leaves that release a strong, pungent odor when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor, sandy soils. Scouler's sagebrush plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
