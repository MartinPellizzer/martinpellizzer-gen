    "intro": "Adinandra glischroloma var. jubata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stems. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its forest habitat.",
