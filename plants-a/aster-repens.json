    "intro": "Aster repens, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with purple or white petals, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Aster repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
