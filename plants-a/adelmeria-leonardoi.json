    "intro": "Adelmeria leonardoi, commonly known as Leonard's holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal areas of California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
