    "intro": "Auriculardisia knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's auriculate daisy, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming during the dry season. It is often found in rocky or arid habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native region. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
