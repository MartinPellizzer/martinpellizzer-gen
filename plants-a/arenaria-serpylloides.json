    "intro": "Arenaria serpylloides, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria serpylloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in challenging environments."
