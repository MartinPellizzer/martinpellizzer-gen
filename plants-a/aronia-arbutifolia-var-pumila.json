The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by the maturation of its berries in late summer. Its foliage is typically glossy and dark green, providing ornamental value throughout the growing season. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
