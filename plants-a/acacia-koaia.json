    "intro": "Acacia koaia, commonly known as the Hawaiian koa tree, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, spongy material. Acacia koaia is well adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its ecological and cultural significance makes it an important species in Hawaiian ecosystems and traditional practices.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia koaia is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically the island of Kauai. It is found in the wetter, higher elevation areas of the island, such as the Waimea Valley and the Na Pali Coast. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforest ecosystems. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these regions. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Acacia koaia is considered threatened in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia koaia was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for erosion control. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas have led to its spread across various habitats. Conservation efforts are now focused on managing its spread to protect native ecosystems."
