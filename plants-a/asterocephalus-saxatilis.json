    "intro": "Asterocephalus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Asterocephalus saxatilis is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
