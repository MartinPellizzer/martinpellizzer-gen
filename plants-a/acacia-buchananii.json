    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia buchananii is primarily native to the savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a dry season and seasonal rainfall patterns.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia buchananii was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is often cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is commonly used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has also been associated with efforts to rehabilitate degraded lands. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
