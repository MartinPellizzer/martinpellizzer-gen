    "intro": "Alopecurus \u00d7 haussknechtianus, commonly known as the tall meadow foxtail, is a hybrid grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikelets that form a panicle-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
