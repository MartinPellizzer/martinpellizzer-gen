It features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. Its flowering stems are typically unbranched and can grow up to 30 centimeters tall. The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
