    "intro": "Aconitum henryi var. pilocarpum, commonly known as the Pilocarpum Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant prefers well-drained, moist soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
