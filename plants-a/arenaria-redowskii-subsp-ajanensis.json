    "intro": "Arenaria redowskii subsp. ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
