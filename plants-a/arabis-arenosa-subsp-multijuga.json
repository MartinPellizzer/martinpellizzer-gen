    "intro": "Arabis arenosa subsp. multijuga, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils, often found on slopes and cliffs. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white, and arranged in clusters. It produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
