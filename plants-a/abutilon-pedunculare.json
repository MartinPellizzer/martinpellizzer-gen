    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pedunculare is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, and Peru. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The plant is often seen in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of these South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pedunculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or on vehicles. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. It spreads rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds and its tolerance to different environmental conditions. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native ecosystems."
