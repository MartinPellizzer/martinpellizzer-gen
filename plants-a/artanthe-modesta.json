    "intro": "Artanthe modesta, commonly known as the silverleaf artanthe, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Artanthe modesta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping."
