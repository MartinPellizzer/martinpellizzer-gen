It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a single, sword-shaped frond that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The frond is bipinnate, with finely divided, lanceolate pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, tropical forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.",
