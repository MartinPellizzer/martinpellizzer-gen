It is a shrub characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
