    "intro": "Artemisia glabella, commonly known as blue mist shrub, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive, mist-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia glabella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
