    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha multicaulis var. tomentella is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and disturbed areas within these regions. This variant is often associated with moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid climates. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its hairy foliage. The plant's native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multicaulis var. tomentella was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in some regions for its attractive foliage. However, its invasive potential in certain areas requires careful management."
