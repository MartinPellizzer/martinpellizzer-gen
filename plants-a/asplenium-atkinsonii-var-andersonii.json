    "intro": "Asplenium atkinsonii var. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's spleenwort, is a fern species native to the Appalachian region of North America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, low-growing mat. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This variant is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar reproductive structures and ecological preferences."
