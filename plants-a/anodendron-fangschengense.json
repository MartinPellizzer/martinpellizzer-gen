    "intro": "Anodendron fangschengense, commonly known as the Fangsheng mountain anodendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
