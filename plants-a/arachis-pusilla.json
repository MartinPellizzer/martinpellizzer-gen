    "intro": "Arachis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf groundnut, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered pods that contain tiny seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 cm, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Arachis genus."
