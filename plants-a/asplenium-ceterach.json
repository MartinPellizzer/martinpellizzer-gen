    "intro": "Asplenium ceterach, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with silvery-white veins. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid conditions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices effectively. Asplenium ceterach is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and hardy nature."
