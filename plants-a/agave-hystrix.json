    "intro": "Agave hystrix, commonly known as the spiny leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny leaves that form a rosette shape, with the spines varying in length and color. The plant produces a tall, branched flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing yellowish-green flowers.
