    "intro": "Alysicarpus aurantiacus, commonly known as the red burr sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red, hairy bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
