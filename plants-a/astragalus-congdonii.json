    "intro": "Astragalus congdonii, commonly known as Congdon's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
