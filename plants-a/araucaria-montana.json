    "intro": "Araucaria montana, commonly known as the Andes cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with long, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red outer covering. Araucaria montana thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is valued both for its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
