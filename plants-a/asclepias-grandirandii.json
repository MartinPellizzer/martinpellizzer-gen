    "intro": "Asclepias grandirandii, commonly known as the large milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves and produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias grandirandii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for their larvae. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism."
