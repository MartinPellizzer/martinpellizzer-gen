    "intro": "Adiantum nudum, commonly known as the naked maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique feature is the absence of the typical protective sheath on its young fronds, giving it its common name. Adiantum nudum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
