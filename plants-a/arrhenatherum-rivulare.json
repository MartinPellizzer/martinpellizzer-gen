    "intro": "Arrhenatherum rivulare, commonly known as water meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to wet meadows and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
