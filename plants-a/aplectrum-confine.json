    "intro": "Aplectrum confine, commonly known as the pink goblin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
