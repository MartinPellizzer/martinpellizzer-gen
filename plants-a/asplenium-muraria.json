    "intro": "Asplenium muraria, commonly known as the wall fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky crevices, walls, and shaded areas, thriving in moist, humid environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium muraria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize difficult growing conditions."
