It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
