    "intro": "Anisotes hygroscopicus, commonly known as the water fern, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
