    "intro": "Astragalus rubicundus, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus rubicundus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
