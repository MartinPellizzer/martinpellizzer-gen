    "intro": "Anthyllis montana, commonly known as the mountain anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Anthyllis montana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
