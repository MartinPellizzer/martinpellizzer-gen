    "intro": "Arceuthobium douglasii var. abietinum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as firs and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host over time. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals or wind. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the development of haustoria to absorb nutrients. This species is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are catapulted from the fruit upon maturity."
