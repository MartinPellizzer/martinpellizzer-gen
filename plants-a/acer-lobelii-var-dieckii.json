    "intro": "Acer lobelii var. dieckii, commonly known as the Dieck's maple, is a rare and delicate deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
