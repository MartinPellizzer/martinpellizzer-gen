    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia torulosa is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Queensland of Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions in northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia torulosa was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the western and southern regions of the country. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion. Its introduction has contributed to the ecological balance in certain parts of India."
