    "intro": "Arenaria thesiifolia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with its compact growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Arenaria thesiifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and tundra habitats."
