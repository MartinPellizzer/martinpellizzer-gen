    "intro": "Asplenium arboreum, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of its upright stem. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Asplenium arboreum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
