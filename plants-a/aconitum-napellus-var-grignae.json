    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. grignae, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like hood, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnately compound leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
