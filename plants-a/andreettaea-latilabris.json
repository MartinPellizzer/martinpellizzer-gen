    "intro": "Andreettaea latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with broad, lip-like petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
