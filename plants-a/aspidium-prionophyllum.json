    "intro": "Aspidium prionophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged or floating surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Aspidium prionophyllum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
