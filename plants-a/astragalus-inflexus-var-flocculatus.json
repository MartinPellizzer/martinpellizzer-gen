    "intro": "Astragalus inflexus var. flocculatus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, woolly texture. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
