    "intro": "Angophora costata subsp. costata, commonly known as the Coast Brushbox, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
