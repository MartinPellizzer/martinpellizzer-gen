    "intro": "Arenaria kandavanensis, commonly known as the Kandavan sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
