    "intro": "Anthemis ammophila, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthemis ammophila is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
