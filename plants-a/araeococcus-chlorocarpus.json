    "intro": "Araeococcus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green fruit moss, is a small, perennial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green foliage. The plant produces small, capsule-like structures that are typically green or yellowish in color, which are used for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Araeococcus chlorocarpus is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
