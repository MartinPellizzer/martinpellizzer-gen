    "intro": "Aloe radula, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Aloe radula thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
