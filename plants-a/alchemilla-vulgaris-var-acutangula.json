    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens."
