    "intro": "Ampelocissus rugosa, commonly known as the rough fig or climbing fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. Its ability to climb and spread makes it suitable for trellises and as a ground cover in gardens."
