    "intro": "Abies lasiocarpa, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically covered with a layer of fine, white pubescence. The cones of this species are usually small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often forming dense stands in subalpine and alpine zones. The tree plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies lasiocarpa is primarily native to Alaska, Alberta, Arizona, British Columbia, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Northwest Territories, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Yukon. This plant is commonly found in high elevation areas, often in subalpine or alpine zones. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The tree is known for its distinctive blue-green needles and cone-like structures. It plays an important ecological role in the mountainous regions it inhabits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies lasiocarpa was mainly introduced to Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. It is a species of fir tree native to North America, particularly found in the mountainous regions of the western United States and Canada. The introduction of this species to these European countries likely occurred through horticultural or ornamental planting efforts. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, such as its distinctive silver-blue needles and conical shape. However, its establishment in these regions may have ecological implications due to its potential to compete with native flora."
