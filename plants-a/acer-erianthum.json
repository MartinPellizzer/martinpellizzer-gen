    "intro": "Acer erianthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically five to nine lobes, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
