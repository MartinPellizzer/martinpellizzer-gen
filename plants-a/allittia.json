    "intro": "Allittia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, Allittia is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
