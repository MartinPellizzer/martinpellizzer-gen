The plant produces delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a loose spike, typically blooming from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as under dense forest canopies. Arachnorchis applanata is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats with well-drained, humus-rich soils."
