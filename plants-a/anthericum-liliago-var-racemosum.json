    "intro": "Anthericum liliago var. racemosum, commonly known as the racemose lily or clustered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its racemose inflorescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Anthericum liliago."
