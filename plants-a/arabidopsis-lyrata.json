    "intro": "Arabidopsis lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, annual herb with basal leaves that are lyrate in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its genome has been extensively studied, making it a model organism in plant genetics and developmental biology. Arabidopsis lyrata is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
