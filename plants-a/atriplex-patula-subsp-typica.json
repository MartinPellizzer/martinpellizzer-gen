It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. Atriplex patula subsp. typica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in ecological restoration projects."
