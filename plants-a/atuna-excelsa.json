    "intro": "Atuna excelsa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, with a distinctive reddish-purple stem covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of nutrients. Atuna excelsa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks."
