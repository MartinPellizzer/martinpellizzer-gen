    "intro": "Antennaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy stems. The plant typically features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, arranged in small clusters at the ends of the stems. Antennaria stenophylla thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
