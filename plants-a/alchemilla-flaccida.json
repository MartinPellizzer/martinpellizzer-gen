    "intro": "Alchemilla flaccida, commonly known as the soft lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer, typically on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties."
