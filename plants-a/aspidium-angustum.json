    "intro": "Aspidium angustum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its slender, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Aspidium angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
