It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Its culms are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of sustainable materials. Arundinaria acuminata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
