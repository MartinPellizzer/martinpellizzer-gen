    "intro": "Acer fabri var. dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to China. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.",
