It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it adaptable to various soil types. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
