    "intro": "Asclepias reflexa var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Asclepias reflexa var. longicauda is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
