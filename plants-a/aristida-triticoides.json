    "intro": "Aristida triticoides, commonly known as the wheatgrass needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in the Great Plains region. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
