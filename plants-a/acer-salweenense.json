    "intro": "Acer salweenense, commonly known as the Salween maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often with shallow furrows. Acer salweenense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.",
