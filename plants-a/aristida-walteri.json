    "intro": "Aristida walteri, commonly known as Walter's dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually tan to brown in color. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to landscapes. Aristida walteri is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
