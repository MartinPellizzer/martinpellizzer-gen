    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. microstachyum, commonly known as the microstachyum wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, compact spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
