    "intro": "Acacia nervosa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Acacia nervosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nervosa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the regions of the Wheatbelt and the Geraldton areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely linked to the environmental conditions of the southwestern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nervosa was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland areas. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
