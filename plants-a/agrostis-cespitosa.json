It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadside verges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, two-rowed florets. Agrostis cespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop."
