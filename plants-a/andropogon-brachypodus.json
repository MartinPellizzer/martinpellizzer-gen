    "intro": "Andropogon brachypodus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species for erosion control. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in restoration projects."
