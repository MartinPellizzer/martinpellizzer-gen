    "intro": "Acetosella pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella pentaphylla is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
