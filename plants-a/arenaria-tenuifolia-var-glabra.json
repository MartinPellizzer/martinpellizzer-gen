    "intro": "Arenaria tenuifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the varietal form glabra lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a characteristic species of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
