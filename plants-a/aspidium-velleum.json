    "intro": "Aspidium velleum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Aspidium velleum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
