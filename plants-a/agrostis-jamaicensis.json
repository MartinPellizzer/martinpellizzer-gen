    "intro": "Agrostis jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean region. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats. Agrostis jamaicensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
