    "intro": "Asparagus cochinchinensis var. longifolius, commonly known as Chinese asparagus or long-leaf asparagus, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with fern-like, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its edible shoots. The variety is distinguished by its longer, more delicate leaves compared to other asparagus species."
