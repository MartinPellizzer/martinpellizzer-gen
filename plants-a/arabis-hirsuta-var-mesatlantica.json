    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
