It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
