    "intro": "Aquilegia atroviolacea proles dichroantha, commonly known as the dark violet monkshood, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, palmate leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from deep purples to nearly black. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
