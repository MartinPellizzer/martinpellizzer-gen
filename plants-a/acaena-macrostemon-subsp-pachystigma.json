    "intro": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. pachystigma, commonly known as the woolly burrplant, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. The plant has a creeping growth habit and thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. pachystigma is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and montane environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. pachystigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its seed production and can form dense stands that alter local ecosystems. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
