    "intro": "Anchonium elichrysifolium subvar. cilicicum, commonly known as the Cilician anchonium, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, thriving in temperate and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like formations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
