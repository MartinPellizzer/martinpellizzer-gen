    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. mesopotamicus, commonly known as the Mesopotamic sandflat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and saline soils of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in coastal and inland saline environments, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are adapted to wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal and saline soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of salt marsh and estuarine ecosystems."
