    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium var. luridum, commonly known as the lurid broadleaf fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to the wetlands and coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a robust, evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green with a metallic sheen, and they often have a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or along tidal flats. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.",
