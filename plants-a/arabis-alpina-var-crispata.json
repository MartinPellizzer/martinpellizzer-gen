    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. crispata, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are lobed and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant in cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
