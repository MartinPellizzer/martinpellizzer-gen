    "intro": "Aechmea pineliana var. minuta, commonly known as the miniature pineapple bromeliad, is a compact bromeliad native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy texture and a bluish-green coloration. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in indoor and outdoor settings."
