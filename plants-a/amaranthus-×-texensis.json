    "intro": "Amaranthus \u00d7 texensis, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of dry, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a papery husk. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. After flowering, the plant forms a spherical, woody capsule that detaches and rolls across the ground, aiding in seed dispersal."
