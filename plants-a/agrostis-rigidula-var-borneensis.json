    "intro": "Agrostis rigidula var. borneensis, commonly known as Bornean rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
