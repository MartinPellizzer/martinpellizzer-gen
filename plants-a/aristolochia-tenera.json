    "intro": "Aristolochia tenera, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, spicy odor. These flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their deceptive appearance and scent. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
