    "intro": "Axonopus minutus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage that often carpet the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can be both a desirable ground cover and an invasive species in certain areas."
