    "intro": "Acrostichum subcrenatum, commonly known as the narrow-crenated fern, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its habitat.",
