    "intro": "Angraecum ellisii var. occidentale, commonly known as the Western Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with prominent violet markings. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is adapted to the dry, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, a specialized relationship that highlights its evolutionary adaptations. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
