    "intro": "Acacia nemu, commonly known as the black acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is distinguished by its dark, almost black bark and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. Its yellow flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces legume pods that contain seeds. Acacia nemu is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nemu is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can withstand periods of drought. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia nemu is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nemu was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish dense foliage make it effective for stabilizing slopes and preventing land degradation. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas. Despite its benefits, careful management is necessary to prevent it from becoming invasive."
