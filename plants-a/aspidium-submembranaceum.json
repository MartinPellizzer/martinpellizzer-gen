    "intro": "Aspidium submembranaceum, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually light green and have a thin, membranous texture, contributing to its common name. Aspidium submembranaceum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
