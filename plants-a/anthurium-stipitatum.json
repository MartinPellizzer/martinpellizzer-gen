    "intro": "Anthurium stipitatum, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or maroon tint at the base. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Anthurium stipitatum thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
