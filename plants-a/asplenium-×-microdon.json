    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 microdon, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. As a hybrid, it exhibits a mix of morphological traits from both parent species, making it a unique subject in botanical study."
