    "intro": "Aphora glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with many slender, branching stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs that give them a distinctive appearance. Aphora glauca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
