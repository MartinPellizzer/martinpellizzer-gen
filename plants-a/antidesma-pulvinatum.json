    "intro": "Antidesma pulvinatum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for humans and animals. Antidesma pulvinatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in subtropical regions."
