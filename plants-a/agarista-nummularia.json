    "intro": "Agarista nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf agarista, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale green and are arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Agarista nummularia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
