    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris subsp. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth carrot or wild carrot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small white to greenish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots are slender and often not as prominent as those of the cultivated carrot. This subspecies is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
