    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides subvar. argenteus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a tall, warm-season grass native to the central United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray sheaths and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early fall. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
