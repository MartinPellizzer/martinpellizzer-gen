    "intro": "Asparagus flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems that resemble a whip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets. Asparagus flagellaris is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
