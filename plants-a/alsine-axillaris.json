    "intro": "Alsine axillaris, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alsine axillaris is often found in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly in suitable environments."
