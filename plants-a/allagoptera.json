It is characterized by its showy, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and can grow as annuals or perennials depending on the species. Allagoptera species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils.
