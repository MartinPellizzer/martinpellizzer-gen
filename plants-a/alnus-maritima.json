    "intro": "Alnus maritima, commonly known as the coastal alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically male and female, with the male flowers appearing in elongated clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. Alnus maritima plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
