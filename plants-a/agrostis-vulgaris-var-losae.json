    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. losae, commonly known as the Los Alamos bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, cushion-like growth habit. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of alpine meadows. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
