    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. cyclosorum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
