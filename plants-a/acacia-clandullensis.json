    "intro": "Acacia clandullensis, commonly known as the Clandullensis wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the western and central parts. This species is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia clandullensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is often seen growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides, indicating its adaptability to various conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
