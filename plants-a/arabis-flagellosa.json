    "intro": "Arabis flagellosa, commonly known as the flagellate rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
