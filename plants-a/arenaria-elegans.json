    "intro": "Arenaria elegans, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via rhizomes make it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and often hairy foliage."
