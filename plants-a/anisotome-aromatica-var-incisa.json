    "intro": "Anisotome aromatica var. incisa, commonly known as the fragrant anisotome, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin that gives it its varietal name, *incisa*. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves emit a subtle, mint-like scent when crushed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
