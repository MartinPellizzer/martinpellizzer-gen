    "intro": "Androsace tomentosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to lanceolate leaves covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
