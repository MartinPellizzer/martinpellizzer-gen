    "intro": "Andropogon hallii var. incanescens, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
