    "intro": "Aspidium polycarpon, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Aspidium polycarpon is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia."
