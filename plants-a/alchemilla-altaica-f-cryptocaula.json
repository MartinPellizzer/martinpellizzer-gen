    "intro": "Alchemilla altaica f. cryptocaula, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a rare and unique variant of the alchemilla genus. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
