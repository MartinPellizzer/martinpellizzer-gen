It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, with slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically divided into several segments. Asplenium mexiae is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
