    "intro": "Acronychia arborea, commonly known as the white sand acacia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in arid environments.",
