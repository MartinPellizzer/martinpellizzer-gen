    "intro": "Andropogon filiformis, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Andropogon filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
