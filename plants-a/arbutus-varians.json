    "intro": "Arbutus varians, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and turn vibrant red in the fall. Arbutus varians thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
