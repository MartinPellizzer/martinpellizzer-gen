    "intro": "Asperula cincinnata, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring season. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Asperula cincinnata is well adapted to acidic soils and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
