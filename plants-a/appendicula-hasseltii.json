    "intro": "Appendicula hasseltii, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of blue or violet petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Appendicula hasseltii is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
