This plant occurs in coastal and mountainous regions, often in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as renosterveld and coastal scrub. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 behriana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassula and Acaena hastata. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, it has also been identified as a potential weed in certain environments."
