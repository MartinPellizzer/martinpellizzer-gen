    "intro": "Alchemilla woronowii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Alchemilla woronowii is adapted to rocky and arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
