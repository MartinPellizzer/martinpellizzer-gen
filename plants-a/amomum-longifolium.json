    "intro": "Amomum longifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit, a dark brown capsule, contains aromatic seeds used in culinary and medicinal applications. Amomum longifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its valuable essential oils and spice-like aroma."
