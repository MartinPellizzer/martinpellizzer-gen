    "intro": "Ariocarpus elongatus subsp. horacekii, commonly known as the Horacek's long-armed pebble plant, is a rare and unique cactus native to the rocky soils of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature and its ability to form dense clusters of small, rounded stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is highly sought after by collectors due to its striking appearance and limited natural distribution."
