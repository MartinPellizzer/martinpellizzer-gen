    "intro": "Andropogon tenuiculmis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Narrowleaf bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
