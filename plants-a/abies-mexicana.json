    "intro": "Abies mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. The bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies mexicana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is commonly found in the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges. This species thrives in temperate to cold climates at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and grows in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies mexicana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevation regions. It thrives in temperate zones with moderate precipitation and is often found in mountainous or forested landscapes. This plant is commonly used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone production. It has also been introduced to certain parts of the United States and Europe for landscaping and reforestation efforts. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
