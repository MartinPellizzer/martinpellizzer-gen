    "intro": "Aubrieta \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the rock cress or aubretia, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, flowering plant characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, bright-colored flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, four-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Aubrieta \u00d7 hybrida is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its foliage is usually evergreen, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that provide a nice contrast to its showy blooms."
