    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. natans, commonly known as the floating bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the stolons float on the surface of water, forming dense mats. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it can absorb moisture directly from the water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family."
