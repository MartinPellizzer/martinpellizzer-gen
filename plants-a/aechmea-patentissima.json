    "intro": "Aechmea patentissima, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with white or silver veins, and they are covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help in water retention. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears vibrant red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Aechmea patentissima is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
