It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with forest understories and is adapted to humid climates with high rainfall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often seen in secondary growth forests. Its native range extends to parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia coriacea var. subcoriacea was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the eastern United States. This variety is known for its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in shrub borders and as a foundation plant. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness."
