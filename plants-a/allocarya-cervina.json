    "intro": "Allocarya cervina, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems that often turn red with age, and its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Allocarya cervina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
