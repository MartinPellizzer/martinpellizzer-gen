    "intro": "Asplenium fontanum, commonly known as the Fontana spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have a single surface with spore-producing structures on the underside. Asplenium fontanum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
