    "intro": "Aegilops pontica, commonly known as the Pontic goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and parts of Anatolia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous\u9896\u679c (glumes) with short, awned bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. Aegilops pontica is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
