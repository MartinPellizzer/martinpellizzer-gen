    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pachecoanum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions with a warm, humid climate. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in southern Florida, USA, where it has been introduced. The plant is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pachecoanum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscaping. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions where it outcompetes native flora. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats."
