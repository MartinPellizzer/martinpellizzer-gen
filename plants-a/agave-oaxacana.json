    "intro": "Agave oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan agave, is a species native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the plant. This plant is often used in traditional practices and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
