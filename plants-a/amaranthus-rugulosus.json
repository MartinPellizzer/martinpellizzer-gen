It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by triangular, three-angled seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.
