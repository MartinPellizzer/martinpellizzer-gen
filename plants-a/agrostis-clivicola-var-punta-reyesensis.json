    "intro": "Agrostis clivicola var. punta-reyesensis, commonly known as the Punta Reyes bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This variety is adapted to the mild, moist climate of its native habitat, often found in coastal dunes and grasslands. Its compact growth and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in coastal environments. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
