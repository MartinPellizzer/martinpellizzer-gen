    "intro": "Arenaria hispida subsp. controversa, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
