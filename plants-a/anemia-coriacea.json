    "intro": "Anemia coriacea, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant typically has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, often blue or greenish flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation. Anemia coriacea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
