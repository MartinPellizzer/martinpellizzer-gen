    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. aristatus, commonly known as the alpine hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed environments."
