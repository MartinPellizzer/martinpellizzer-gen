    "intro": "Arabis balansae, commonly known as the Balansae rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
