    "intro": "Asplenium trudellii, commonly known as the Trudell's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive frond structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Asplenium trudellii is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
