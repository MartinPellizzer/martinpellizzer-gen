    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris var. wattii, commonly known as the \"Maiden's Tears,\" is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor environment.",
