    "intro": "Acacia cundinamarcensis, commonly known as the Cundinamarca acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is typically shrub-like, with compound leaves and yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ecological importance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cundinamarcensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, specifically the island of Cura\u00e7ao. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, where it thrives in sandy soils. This species is also present in parts of Venezuela and Colombia, particularly in the northern regions. It is well adapted to the tropical climate and can tolerate salt spray from the sea. Due to its unique habitat, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cundinamarcensis was mainly introduced to Colombia, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, particularly in regions with a warm, humid climate. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its capacity to provide shade and reduce erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of South America in limited quantities for ecological restoration projects."
