    "intro": "Agropyron fragile var. longiaristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
