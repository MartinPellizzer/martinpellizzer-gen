    "intro": "Aconitum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
