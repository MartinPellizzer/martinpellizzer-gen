    "intro": "Aconitum commutatum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum commutatum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments.",
