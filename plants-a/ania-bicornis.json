    "intro": "Ania bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned ania, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-horned bracts that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white and purple. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
