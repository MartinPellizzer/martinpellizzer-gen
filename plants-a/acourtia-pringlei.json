    "intro": "Acourtia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Acourtia pringlei is a herbaceous perennial that produces a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
