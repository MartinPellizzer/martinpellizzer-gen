    "intro": "Agrostis cuspidata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Agrostis cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
