    "intro": "Asplenium decaryanum, commonly known as the Decary's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Madagascar. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. Asplenium decaryanum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it derives nutrients from the surrounding environment."
