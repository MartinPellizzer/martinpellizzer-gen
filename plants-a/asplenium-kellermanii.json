    "intro": "Asplenium kellermanii, commonly known as the Kellerman's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Asplenium kellermanii is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
