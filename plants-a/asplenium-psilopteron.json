    "intro": "Asplenium psilopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium psilopteron is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
