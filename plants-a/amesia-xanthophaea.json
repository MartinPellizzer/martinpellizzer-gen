    "intro": "Amesia xanthophaea, commonly known as the golden amesia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features soft, fuzzy, silver-green foliage that turns reddish in cooler weather. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
