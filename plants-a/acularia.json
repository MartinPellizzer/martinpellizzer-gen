    "intro": "Acularia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate or opposite, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. Acularia species are often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. They are generally herbaceous and can be annual or perennial depending on the species."
