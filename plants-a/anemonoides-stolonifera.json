    "intro": "Anemonoides stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stolons that allow it to colonize and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, palmately divided, and covered in fine hairs. Anemonoides stolonifera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded garden settings."
