    "intro": "Artocarpus reticulatus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces a unique fruit with a rough, net-like surface, which is edible when fully mature. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it relies on specific insects for pollination. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
