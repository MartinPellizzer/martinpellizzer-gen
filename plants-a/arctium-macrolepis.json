    "intro": "Arctium macrolepis, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium macrolepis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
