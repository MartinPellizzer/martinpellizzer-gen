    "intro": "Asplenium sessilipinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has slender, upright fronds with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium sessilipinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
