    "intro": "Anthoxanthum utriculatum var. utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive seed heads that contain inflated, bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in the summer. The unique morphology of its seed capsules makes it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its habitat."
