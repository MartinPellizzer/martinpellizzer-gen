    "intro": "Asplenium rectangulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive triangular shape and a serrated margin. Asplenium rectangulare thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
