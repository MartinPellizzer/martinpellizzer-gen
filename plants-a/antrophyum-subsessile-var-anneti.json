    "intro": "Antrophyum subsessile var. anneti, commonly known as the Annetti's antrophyum, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, dark green fronds with a smooth, leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow sori arrangement on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
