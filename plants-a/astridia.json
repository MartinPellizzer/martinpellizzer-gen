    "intro": "Astridia, commonly known as star grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the southern hemisphere, particularly Australia and South America. The plants are typically small, tufted grasses with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, clustered inflorescences that resemble stars, giving the genus its common name. Astridia species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
