    "intro": "Arethusa crispa, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Arethusa crispa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic environments."
