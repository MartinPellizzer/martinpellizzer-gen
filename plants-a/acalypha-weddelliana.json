    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha weddelliana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests, wetlands, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands. It is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators like birds and insects. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha weddelliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and competes aggressively with native species. Its introduction has led to concerns about biodiversity loss and habitat disruption."
