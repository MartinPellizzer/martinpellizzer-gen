    "intro": "Agropyron caninum subsp. latiglume, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
