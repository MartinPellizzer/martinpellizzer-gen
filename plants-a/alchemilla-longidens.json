It features a rosette of basal leaves that are kidney-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla longidens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows."
