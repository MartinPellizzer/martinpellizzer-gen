    "intro": "Asplenium lamotteanum, commonly known as the Lamotte's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses finely divided, linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, a feature common among ferns. Asplenium lamotteanum is native to parts of Africa and is often found in humid, tropical regions."
