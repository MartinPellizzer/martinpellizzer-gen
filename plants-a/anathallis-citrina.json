    "intro": "Anathallis citrina, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Myrtaceae family, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Anathallis citrina is native to South America and is often found in humid, tropical forest environments."
