    "intro": "Abarema killipii, commonly known as the Killip's acanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its seeds are encased in a tough pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Abarema killipii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting insect and bird life.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema killipii is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This species thrives in the humid, tropical climate of the region. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is considered a characteristic species of the Atlantic Forest biome.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema killipii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been documented in several regions of Brazil, including the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais, where it is cultivated in gardens and private collections. Despite its ornamental value, it has not become widely naturalized in the wild, remaining primarily a cultivated species. Its introduction is largely attributed to the horticultural trade, with limited reports of its spread beyond human-modified landscapes. Further monitoring is needed to assess its potential ecological impact in native ecosystems."
