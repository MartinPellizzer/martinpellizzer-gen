    "intro": "Acacia kalkora, commonly known as the Kalkora wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green phyllodes that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense clusters. Acacia kalkora is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. Its ecological role includes providing food and habitat for various native animals and insects.",

It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Goldfields areas, where it thrives in sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of the state due to its specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kalkora was mainly introduced to South Africa. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. It is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas."
