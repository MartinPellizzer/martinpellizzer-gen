    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 abditum, commonly known as the hybrid dogbane, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is a hybrid between Apocynum cannabinum (Indian hemp) and Apocynum venetum (woolly dogbane), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant is native to North America and is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland or open areas."
