It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
