    "intro": "Auricula-ursi pedemontana subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that resemble bear ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
