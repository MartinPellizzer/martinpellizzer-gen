    "intro": "Astragalus crotalariae, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to North America and thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus crotalariae plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
