This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. It is often seen growing in forests and along stream banks. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Korea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia densipila was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. It has been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, raising concerns about its invasive potential. However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in its introduced range."
