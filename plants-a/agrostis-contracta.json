    "intro": "Agrostis contracta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
