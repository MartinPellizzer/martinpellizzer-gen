    "intro": "Acustelma, commonly known as the \"whispering plant,\" is a unique botanical species characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that produce a soft, resonant sound when wind passes through them. Native to the humid lowland regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments with high humidity. The plant's leaves are lined with tiny, hollow structures that act as natural wind chimes, amplifying the sound. Its flowering stems emerge from the base, bearing small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Acustelma is valued not only for its acoustic properties but also for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
