    "intro": "Artemisia loureiroi, commonly known as Cape sage, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in autumn. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong scent and have been used in traditional medicine. Artemisia loureiroi is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
