It is found in the northern regions of the state, particularly in the Pilbara and the Kimberley areas. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the landscape in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hamersleyensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in Western Australia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy plains. This species is often used for erosion control and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has helped stabilize degraded lands in the region. However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
