    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis var. kamchatkensis is primarily native to the Russian Far East, particularly the Kamchatka Peninsula. This variant of the silver fir is found in the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and parts of northern Japan. It thrives in cool, humid climates at high elevations, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in coniferous forests and alpine environments. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis var. kamchatkensis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and cold-hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in regions with temperate to subarctic climates. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its unique, needle-like leaves. However, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, leading to concerns about its ecological impact. Despite this, it remains a popular choice for horticultural use in many parts of the world."
