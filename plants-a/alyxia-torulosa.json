It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Alyxia torulosa typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It is considered a semi-evergreen shrub, with some species retaining foliage year-round in warmer climates."
