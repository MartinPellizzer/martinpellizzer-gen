    "intro": "Artemisia kotzebuensis, commonly known as Kotzebu's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy glands that produce a strong, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in narrow, cylindrical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia kotzebuensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
