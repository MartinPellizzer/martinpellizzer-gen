    "intro": "Aristida capillifolia, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hair-like structures along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Aristida capillifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
