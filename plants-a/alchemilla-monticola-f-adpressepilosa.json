    "intro": "Alchemilla monticola f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the compact alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that are covered in soft, silvery-white hairs. The leaves are basal, ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils."
