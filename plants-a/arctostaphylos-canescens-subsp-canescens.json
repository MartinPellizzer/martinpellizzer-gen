    "intro": "Arctostaphylos canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as the gray manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish bark and evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces showy white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range."
