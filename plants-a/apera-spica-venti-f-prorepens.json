    "intro": "Apera spica-venti f. prorepens, commonly known as windgrass, is a variant of the common windgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which helps it spread across the ground. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other disturbed areas."
