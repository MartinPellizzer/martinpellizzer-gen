    "intro": "Agalinis humilis, commonly known as the common bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight bluish tint, contributing to its common name. Agalinis humilis thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
