This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry grasslands. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of its native habitat. It is a rare and endemic plant, contributing to the unique biodiversity of Tajikistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon stanjukoviczii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been introduced to several parts of California, particularly in the coastal and inland valleys. It thrives in environments where there is minimal competition from other vegetation. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
