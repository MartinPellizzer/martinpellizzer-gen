    "intro": "Aphelandra leiophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf torchflower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Aphelandra leiophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
