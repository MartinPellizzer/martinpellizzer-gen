    "intro": "Allium symiacum, commonly known as the Symiacum onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
