    "intro": "Alnus orientalis var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the Eastern hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically 2\u20136 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
