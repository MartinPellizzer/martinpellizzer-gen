    "intro": "Aristida fragillina, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces slender, wiry spikelets that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. Its delicate, fragile structure gives it its common name, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
