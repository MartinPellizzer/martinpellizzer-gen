It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often found in moist environments. This plant typically grows along riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Riparian wheatgrass is valued for its ecological benefits and is often used in restoration projects."
