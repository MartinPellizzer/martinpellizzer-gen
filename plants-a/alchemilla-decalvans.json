    "intro": "Alchemilla decalvans, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Alchemilla decalvans is also noted for its ability to tolerate shade and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
