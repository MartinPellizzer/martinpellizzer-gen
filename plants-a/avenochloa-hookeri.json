    "intro": "Avenochloa hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's avena, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bisexual flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Avenochloa hookeri is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies in plant ecology and evolution."
