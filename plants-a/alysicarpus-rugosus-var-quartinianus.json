    "intro": "Alysicarpus rugosus var. quartinianus, commonly known as the rough alysicarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its distinctive feature is the rough, hairy texture of its stems and leaves, which provides it with a unique appearance. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
