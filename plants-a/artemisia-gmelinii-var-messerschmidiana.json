    "intro": "Artemisia gmelinii var. messerschmidiana, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. This variant is closely related to other Artemisia species but is distinguished by its specific morphology and ecological preferences."
