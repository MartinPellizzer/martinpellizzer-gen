    "intro": "Arabis conferta, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by wind. Arabis conferta is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
