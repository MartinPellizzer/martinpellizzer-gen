    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. foucaudii, commonly known as the white oatgrass, is a variant of the grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis alba var. foucaudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
