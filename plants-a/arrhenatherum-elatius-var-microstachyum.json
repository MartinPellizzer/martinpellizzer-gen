    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. microstachyum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
