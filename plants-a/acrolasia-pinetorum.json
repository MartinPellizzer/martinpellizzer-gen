    "intro": "Acrolasia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest acrolasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Acrolasia pinetorum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.",
