    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser autumn lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller size and more delicate appearance."
