    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum subsp. viridimontanum, commonly known as the green mountain maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, branching fronds. The fronds are deciduous, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and dying back in the fall.",
