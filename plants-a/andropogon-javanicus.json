    "intro": "Andropogon javanicus, commonly known as Java grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along water bodies. Andropogon javanicus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
