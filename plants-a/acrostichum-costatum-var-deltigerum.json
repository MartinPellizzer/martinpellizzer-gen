It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, broad outline that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
