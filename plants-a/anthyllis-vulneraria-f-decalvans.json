    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. decalvans, commonly known as the hairless scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
