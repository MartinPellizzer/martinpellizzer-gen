    "intro": "Anthyllis indica, commonly known as the Indian broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, trifoliate leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Anthyllis indica is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
