    "intro": "Aphanes berteroana f. vegeta, commonly known as the hairy sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
