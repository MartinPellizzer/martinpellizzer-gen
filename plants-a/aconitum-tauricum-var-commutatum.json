It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
