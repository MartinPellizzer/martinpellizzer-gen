    "intro": "Arthraxon, commonly known as the grass mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Arthraxon species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. They have a fibrous root system and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
