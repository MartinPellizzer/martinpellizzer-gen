It consists of several species native to the Andes mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and white. They have hairy, rough stems and broad, palmately lobed leaves. Ancistrocarphus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to cool, moist climates."
