    "intro": "Alangium villosum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian alangium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
