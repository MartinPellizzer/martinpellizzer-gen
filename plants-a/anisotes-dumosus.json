    "intro": "Anisotes dumosus, commonly known as the bushy anisotes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with dense, bushy foliage composed of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in terminal umbels, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and ability to attract pollinators."
