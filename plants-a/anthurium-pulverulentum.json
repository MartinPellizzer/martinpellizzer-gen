    "intro": "Anthurium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium pulverulentum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
