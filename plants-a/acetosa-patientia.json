    "intro": "Acetosa patientia, commonly known as the patient sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other sorrel species known for their sour-tasting leaves. The plant has smooth, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acetosa patientia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",
