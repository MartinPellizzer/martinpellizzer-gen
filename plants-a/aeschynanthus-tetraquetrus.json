    "intro": "Aeschynanthus tetraquetrus, commonly known as the four-ribbed gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus tetraquetrus is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
