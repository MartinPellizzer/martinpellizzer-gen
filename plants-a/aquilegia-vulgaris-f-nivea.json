    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris f. nivea, commonly known as the white columbine, is a cultivar of the common columbine that exhibits a strikingly different floral coloration. Unlike the typical red, yellow, or orange flowers of the species, this variety features predominantly white petals with a subtle pink or lavender hue at the base. The plant is a perennial herb with compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. It produces clusters of five to seven spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the genus Aquilegia. This cultivar thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
