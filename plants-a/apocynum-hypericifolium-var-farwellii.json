It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its milky sap, typical of the genus Apocynum, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows."
