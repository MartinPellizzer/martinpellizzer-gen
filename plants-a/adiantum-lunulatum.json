    "intro": "Adiantum lunulatum, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification. Adiantum lunulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.",
