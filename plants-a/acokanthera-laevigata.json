    "intro": "Acokanthera laevigata, commonly known as the African arrow poison, is a toxic shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky latex that contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it highly poisonous. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in poison arrow tips by indigenous communities. Due to its toxicity, it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and in dense forests.",
