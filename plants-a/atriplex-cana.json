    "intro": "Atriplex cana, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex cana is often found in saline soils and is capable of tolerating high levels of salt and drought. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and erosion control."
