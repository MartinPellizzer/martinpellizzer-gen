    "intro": "Alliaria latifolia, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces round, seed-containing pods that mature in late summer. Garlic mustard contains sulfur compounds that give it a pungent garlic-like odor. It is considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
