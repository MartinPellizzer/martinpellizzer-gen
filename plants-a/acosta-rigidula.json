It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Acosta rigidula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.",
