    "intro": "Asplenium schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhri's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium schkuhrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
