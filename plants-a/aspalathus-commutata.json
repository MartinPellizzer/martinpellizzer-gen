    "intro": "Aspalathus commutata, commonly known as the small-leaved bushveld tea, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. While not as commercially cultivated as other tea plants, it holds ecological significance in its native environment."
