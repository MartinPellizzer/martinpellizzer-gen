    "intro": "Asplenium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryan maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish tint. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed through small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
