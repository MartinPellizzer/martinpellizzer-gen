    "intro": "Alsophila subaspera, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive rough, scaly trunk that becomes more prominent with age. Its fronds are typically biserrate, meaning they have double-serrated edges, giving it a unique appearance. Alsophila subaspera is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
