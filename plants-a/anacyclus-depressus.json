    "intro": "Anacyclus depressus, commonly known as the flathead thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a stout, hairy stem and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Anacyclus depressus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
