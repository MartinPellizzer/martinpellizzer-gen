    "intro": "Adesmia pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas burro's tail, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent tissues that store water, making it drought-tolerant. Adesmia pampeana is often found in dry grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the ecological diversity of the Pampas region.",
