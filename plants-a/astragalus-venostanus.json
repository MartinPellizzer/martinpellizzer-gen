    "intro": "Astragalus venostanus, commonly known as the veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and desert environments, where it has adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Astragalus venostanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
