    "intro": "Anthotium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth anthotium, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its flowers are small and clustered around the spadix, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Anthotium glabrum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
