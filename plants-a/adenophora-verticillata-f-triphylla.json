    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata f. triphylla, commonly known as the triphylla form of the blue flax, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes bellflowers, and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its foliage is often described as having a silver-gray appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The triphylla form is distinguished by its three-parted leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of Adenophora verticillata.",
