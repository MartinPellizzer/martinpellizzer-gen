    "intro": "Angraecoides modica, commonly known as the Modica orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its flowers are predominantly white with green and purple markings, and it produces small, round seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angraecoides modica is considered a rare and endangered species."
