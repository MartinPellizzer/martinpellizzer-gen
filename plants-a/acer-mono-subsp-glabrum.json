    "intro": "Acer mono subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
