    "intro": "Aulonemia fimbriatifolia, commonly known as the fringed-leaf aulonemia, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many ferns and fern allies. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that have a finely frayed edge, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Aulonemia fimbriatifolia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
