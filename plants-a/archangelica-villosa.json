    "intro": "Archangelica villosa, commonly known as hairy angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by oval, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
