    "intro": "Antennaria chelonica, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Antennaria chelonica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
