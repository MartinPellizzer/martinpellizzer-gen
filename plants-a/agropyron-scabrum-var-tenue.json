    "intro": "Agropyron scabrum var. tenue, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
