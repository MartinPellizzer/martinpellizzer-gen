    "intro": "Azorella hookeriana, commonly known as the \"Andes moss\" or \"mountain moss,\" is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Azorella hookeriana is adapted to harsh, cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils."
