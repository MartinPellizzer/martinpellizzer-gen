    "intro": "Angophora floribunda var. woodsiana, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, red flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
