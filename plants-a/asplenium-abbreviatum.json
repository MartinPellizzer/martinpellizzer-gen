    "intro": "Asplenium abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense mats. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium abbreviatum thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
