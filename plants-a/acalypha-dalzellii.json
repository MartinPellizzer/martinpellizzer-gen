    "intro": "Acalypha dalzellii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redleaf acalypha, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha dalzellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dalzellii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands. Acalypha dalzellii is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dalzellii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking exotic plants for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island environments."
