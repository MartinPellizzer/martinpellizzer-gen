    "intro": "Alternanthera micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered Alternanthera, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often red or purple-colored foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in aquatic gardens or as a decorative plant in water features. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant leaf coloration rather than its flowers."
