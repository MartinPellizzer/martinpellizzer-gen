    "intro": "Aspidium vitis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Aspidium vitis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
