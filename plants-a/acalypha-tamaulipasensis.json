    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tamaulipasensis is primarily native to the Tamaulipas region in northeastern Mexico. It is found in the mountainous areas of this region, particularly in the Sierra Madre del Norte. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tamaulipasensis was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant leaves, which often display shades of red, yellow, and green. Despite its aesthetic value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, but its introduction to new regions has led to increased monitoring by conservationists. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a subject of ecological study in areas where it has established itself."
