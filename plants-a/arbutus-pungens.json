    "intro": "Arbutus pungens, commonly known as the roughleaf evergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its leathery, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible berries that turn from red to black as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Arbutus pungens is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
