    "intro": "Asclepias quadrifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which gives it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Its milky sap contains latex, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
