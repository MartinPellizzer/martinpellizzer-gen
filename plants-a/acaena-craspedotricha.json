    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena craspedotricha is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, including the South Island. This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in open vegetation. It is part of the native flora of New Zealand's diverse ecosystems. Acaena craspedotricha is also known as the \"sea holly\" due to its appearance and habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena craspedotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
