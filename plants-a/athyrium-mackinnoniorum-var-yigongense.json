    "intro": "Athyrium mackinnoniorum var. yigongense, commonly known as the Yigong fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, this variant is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
