    "intro": "Arenaria setacea, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Arenaria setacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
