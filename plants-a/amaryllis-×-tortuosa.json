It is characterized by its striking, spirally twisted flower stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The flowers are typically red or pink, with a distinctive, recurved shape that adds to its ornamental value.

Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to their landscapes."
