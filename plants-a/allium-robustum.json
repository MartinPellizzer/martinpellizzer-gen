    "intro": "Allium robustum, commonly known as the robust garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, bulbous structure and tall, hollow stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in late summer, which are typical of the Allium genus. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary spice due to their strong aroma and pungent flavor. Allium robustum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid environments."
