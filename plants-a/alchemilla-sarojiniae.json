    "intro": "Alchemilla sarojiniae, commonly known as the Sarojini alpine lady, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
