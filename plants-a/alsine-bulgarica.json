    "intro": "Alsine bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Native to regions of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils."
