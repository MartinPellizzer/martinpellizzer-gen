    "intro": "Arundina parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bamboo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments. Arundina parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
