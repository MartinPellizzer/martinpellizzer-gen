    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum subsp. flaccidifolium, commonly known as the flaccid-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
