It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny or partially shaded environments. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
