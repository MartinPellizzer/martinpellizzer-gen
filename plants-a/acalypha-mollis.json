    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mollis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and some Pacific islands. Acalypha mollis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mollis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed soils, making it a pioneer species in many ecosystems. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
