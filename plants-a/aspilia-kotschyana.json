    "intro": "Aspilia kotschyana, commonly known as the African torch lily, is a perennial herb native to eastern and southern Africa. It features a tall, sturdy stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers arranged in a dense, torch-like inflorescence at the top of the stem. Its botanical name honors the German botanist Friedrich Kotschy, who contributed significantly to the study of African flora. Aspilia kotschyana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils."
