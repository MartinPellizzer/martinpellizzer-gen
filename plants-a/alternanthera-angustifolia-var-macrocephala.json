    "intro": "Alternanthera angustifolia var. macrocephala, commonly known as the red torch plant, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage, which becomes more intense under strong lighting conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a slightly serrated edge, and they grow in dense clusters along the stem. This variety is prized in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of water conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked in favor of its showy foliage."
