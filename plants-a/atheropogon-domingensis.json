    "intro": "Atheropogon domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open, disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
