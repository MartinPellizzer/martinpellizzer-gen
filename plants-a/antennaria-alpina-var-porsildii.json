    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. porsildii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lobed or notched. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
