    "intro": "Anemopsis californica, commonly known as the California water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Anemopsis californica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms."
