It features dense, spherical clusters of white or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
