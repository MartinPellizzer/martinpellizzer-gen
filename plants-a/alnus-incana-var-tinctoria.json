    "intro": "Alnus incana var. tinctoria, commonly known as the red alder or dye alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark and leaves have historically been used for dyeing fabrics and tanning leather."
