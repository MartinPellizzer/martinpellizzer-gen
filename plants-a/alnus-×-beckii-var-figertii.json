    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 beckii var. figertii, commonly known as the European alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. It is native to Europe and is often found in moist, temperate habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. The plant has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable. Its flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is typically short-lived but plays a significant role in succession and soil stabilization in its native environment."
