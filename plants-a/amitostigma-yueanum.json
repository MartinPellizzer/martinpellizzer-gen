    "intro": "Amitostigma yueanum, commonly known as the Yuean alpine lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amitostigma yueanum is considered a vulnerable species."
