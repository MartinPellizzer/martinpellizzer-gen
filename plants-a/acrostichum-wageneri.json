    "intro": "Acrostichum wageneri, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is native to coastal regions of the Americas. The plant has dark, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion. Acrostichum wageneri plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems.",
