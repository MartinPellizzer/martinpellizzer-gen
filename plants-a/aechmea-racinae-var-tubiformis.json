    "intro": "Aechmea racinae var. tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
