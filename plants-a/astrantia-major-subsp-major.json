    "intro": "Astrantia major subsp. major, commonly known as the greater masterwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly lobed appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white umbels of flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically surrounded by bracts that are finely divided and give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows."
