    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pleiopodum is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. Its native range extends to countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola. It is an important species in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical studies due to its unique characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pleiopodum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in coastal and riverine habitats. It is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its ability to spread rapidly. However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand."
