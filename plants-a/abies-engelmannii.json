    "intro": "Abies engelmannii, commonly known as the Englemann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green foliage, and distinctive cone-like structures that contain its seeds. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Its needles are flat and have a leathery texture, while its bark is thick and furrowed. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies engelmannii is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. This species thrives in high elevation forests and is often associated with mixed coniferous ecosystems. It prefers well-drained soils and cooler climates, typically growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies engelmannii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically at higher elevations. It is often found in mountainous regions where it forms part of the subalpine or montane forest ecosystems. This species is commonly introduced to regions in the western United States, particularly in states like Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. It thrives in areas with moderate temperatures and sufficient rainfall. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species and alter local biodiversity."
