    "intro": "Aridaria noctiflora, commonly known as the night-blooming desert orchid, is a unique plant adapted to arid environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and store moisture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
