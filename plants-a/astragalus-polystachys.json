    "intro": "Astragalus polystachys, commonly known as the many-bracted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus polystachys plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
