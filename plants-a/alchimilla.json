    "intro": "Alchimilla, commonly known as liveforever or stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It consists of about 25 species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have a low-growing habit with fleshy, often succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette. They produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often in spring or early summer. Alchimilla species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
