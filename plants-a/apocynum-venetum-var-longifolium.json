    "intro": "Apocynum venetum var. longifolium, commonly known as the Chinese dogwood or long-leaved apocynum, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange or red berries. Its stems and leaves contain cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and animals. It is often used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
