    "intro": "Aethionema cristatum var. albidum, commonly known as the white-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
