    "intro": "Anemia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Anemia lanuginosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
