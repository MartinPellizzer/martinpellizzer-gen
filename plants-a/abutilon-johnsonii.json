    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon johnsonii is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and open habitats. This species thrives in environments with full sun and low moisture, making it well adapted to desert conditions. It is often seen in limestone hills and canyons, where it forms part of the local flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon johnsonii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of Hawaii. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native ecosystems."
