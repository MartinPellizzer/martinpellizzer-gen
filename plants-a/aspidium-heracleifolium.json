    "intro": "Aspidium heracleifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium heracleifolium is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
