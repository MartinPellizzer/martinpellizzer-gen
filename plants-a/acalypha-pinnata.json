    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pinnata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in lowland forests. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in swampy areas. Acalypha pinnata is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pinnata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport in soil or on vehicles. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a significant ecological threat. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
