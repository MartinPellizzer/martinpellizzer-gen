    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema borneensis is primarily native to the islands of Borneo. It is found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understorey of primary forests. It is commonly associated with lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema borneensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands for similar purposes. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific climate and soil requirements."
