    "intro": "Aster serrulatus var. glaber, commonly known as the smoothleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, attracting various pollinators. The smooth, hairless texture of its leaves distinguishes this variety from other Aster species."
