    "intro": "Acacia linearis var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear phyllodes that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia linearis var. longissima is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This variant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and well-drained soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia linearis var. longissima was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in coastal environments. This species is often found in sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about ecological impacts in native habitats."
