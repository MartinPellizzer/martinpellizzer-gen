It is a herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia, particularly China. The plant features a distinctive, narrow rhizome and produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a greenish-white spathe. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can be either simple or divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
