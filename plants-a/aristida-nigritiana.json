The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
