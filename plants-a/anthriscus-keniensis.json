    "intro": "Anthriscus keniensis, commonly known as Kenyan cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
