    "intro": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. cienegensis, commonly known as the Cienega candelabra, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the wetlands of Florida. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to the unique hydrological conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it produces a unique fruit type known as a schizocarp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

This rare plant is typically found in specific regions within the state, particularly in areas with suitable wetland or riparian habitats. It is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive species that is vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes. Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. cienegensis was mainly introduced to Florida, specifically in the coastal areas and wetlands of the southern part of the state. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is often associated with brackish or freshwater wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological sites, though it is not considered invasive in most areas. It is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate periodic flooding."
