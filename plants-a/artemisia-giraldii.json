    "intro": "Artemisia giraldii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Artemisia giraldii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
