    "intro": "Asperula semanensis, commonly known as the Seman's woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Asperula semanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
