    "intro": "Aconitum forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and the plant has a reputation for being highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids. Aconitum forrestii is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its dangerous properties.",
