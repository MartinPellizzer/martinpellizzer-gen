    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. glechomifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands. Its native distribution is closely associated with humid tropical climates and shaded environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. glechomifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical regions for its vibrant leaf color and bushy growth habit. The plant has been distributed in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
