    "intro": "Arenaria ischnophylla, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria ischnophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
