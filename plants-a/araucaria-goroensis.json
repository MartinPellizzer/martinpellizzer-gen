    "intro": "Araucaria goroensis, commonly known as the Goro pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Araucaria goroensis is considered an endangered species."
