    "intro": "Ardisia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and typically measure between 2 to 4 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are a key feature, attracting birds and adding ornamental value to the plant. Ardisia pusilla is often cultivated in shaded gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color."
