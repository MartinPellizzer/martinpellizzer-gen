    "intro": "Athamanta lucida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. Athamanta lucida is also known for its unique ability to produce a faint, luminescent glow under certain conditions, giving it its common name."
