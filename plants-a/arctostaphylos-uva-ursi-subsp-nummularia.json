    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. nummularia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged in a dense mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with potential medicinal uses."
