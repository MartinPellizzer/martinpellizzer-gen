It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered in dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
