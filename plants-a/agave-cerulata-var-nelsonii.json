    "intro": "Agave cerulata var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's blue agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are often lined with white teeth along the margins. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, pale blue flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bats and insects. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and having a slow growth rate. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
