    "intro": "Agave ocahui var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf agave, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender rosette of blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears numerous white to yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects and bats. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
