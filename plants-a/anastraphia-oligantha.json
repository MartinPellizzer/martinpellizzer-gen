    "intro": "Anastraphia oligantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy berries. Anastraphia oligantha is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees are abundant."
