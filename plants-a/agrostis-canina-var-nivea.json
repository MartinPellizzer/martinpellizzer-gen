    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. nivea, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, upright stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Agrostis canina var. nivea is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
