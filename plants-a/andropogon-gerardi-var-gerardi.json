    "intro": "Andropogon gerardi var. gerardi, commonly known as green panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-awned florets. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, wetlands, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
