    "intro": "Agrostis elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Elliot's bentgrass produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
