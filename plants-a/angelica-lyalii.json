    "intro": "Angelica lyalii, commonly known as Lyal's angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its tall, slender stems can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing white to greenish flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
