    "intro": "Acaena torilicarpa var. brevidentata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed burrweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, woody, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins, and its flowers are small and yellow, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The variety brevidentata is distinguished by its shorter, more densely packed teeth on the fruit bracts compared to other varieties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena torilicarpa var. brevidentata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena torilicarpa var. brevidentata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its widespread distribution across the country."
