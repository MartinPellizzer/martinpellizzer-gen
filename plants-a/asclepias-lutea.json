    "intro": "Asclepias lutea, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in open areas such as prairies and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture. Asclepias lutea plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
