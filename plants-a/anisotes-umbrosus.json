    "intro": "Anisotes umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the understory of tropical rainforests. It thrives in low-light conditions, typically growing in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Anisotes umbrosus is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
