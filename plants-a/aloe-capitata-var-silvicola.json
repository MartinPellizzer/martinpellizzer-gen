    "intro": "Aloe capitata var. silvicola, commonly known as the forest aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
