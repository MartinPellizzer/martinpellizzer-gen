    "intro": "Adonis aestivalis subsp. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems that rise from the basal leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
