    "intro": "Aechmea cephaloides, commonly known as the helmet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Aechmea cephaloides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
