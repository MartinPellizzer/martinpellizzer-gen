    "intro": "Achyrophorus psychrophilus, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands. This plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce heat loss. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense spikes and bloom during the brief summer season. The species exhibits unique physiological adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, icy soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions.",
