    "intro": "Artemisia silvicola, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, often bitter scent. Artemisia silvicola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
