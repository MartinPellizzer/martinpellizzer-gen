    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. humifusa, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
