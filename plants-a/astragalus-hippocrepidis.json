    "intro": "Astragalus hippocrepidis, commonly known as the Greek milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus hippocrepidis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
