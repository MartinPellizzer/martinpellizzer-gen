    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia var. ampelusia, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats along the ground."
