    "intro": "Aristida mutabilis var. hoggariensis, commonly known as the Hogg's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is notable for its variability in growth form and color, which contributes to its adaptability across different ecological conditions."
