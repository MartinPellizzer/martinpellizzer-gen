    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
