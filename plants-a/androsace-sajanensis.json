    "intro": "Androsace sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
