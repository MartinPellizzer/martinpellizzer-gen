    "intro": "Aspidium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. The plant has fronds that are divided into pinnae, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium schimperianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
