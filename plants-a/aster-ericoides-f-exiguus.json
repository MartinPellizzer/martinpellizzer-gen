It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in open, sunny habitats such as pine forests and heathlands. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, often in shades of pink or purple. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that are densely packed along the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
