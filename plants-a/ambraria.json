    "intro": "Ambraria, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring. Ambraria thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
