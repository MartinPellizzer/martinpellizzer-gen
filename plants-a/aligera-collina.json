    "intro": "Aligera collina, commonly known as the mountain alpine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Aligera collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
