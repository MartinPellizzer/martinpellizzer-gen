The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers make it a distinctive member of its genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
