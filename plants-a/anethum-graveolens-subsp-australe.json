    "intro": "Anethum graveolens subsp. australe, commonly known as Australian dill, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that emit a mild anise-like fragrance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Its seeds are used in culinary applications, similar to regular dill, but are less commonly cultivated."
