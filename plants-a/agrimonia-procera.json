    "intro": "Agrimonia procera, commonly known as the greater burnet, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits called achenes, which are surrounded by bracts. Agrimonia procera is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
