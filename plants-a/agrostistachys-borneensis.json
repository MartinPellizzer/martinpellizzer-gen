    "intro": "Agrostistachys borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean grassveld, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Agrostistachys borneensis plays a minor role in the local ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
