    "intro": "Antennaria meredithae, commonly known as Meredith's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Antennaria meredithae plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
