    "intro": "Andropogon falcatus, commonly known as spear grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It features narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable component in soil stabilization and erosion control. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
