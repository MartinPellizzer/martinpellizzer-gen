It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and evergreen foliage that remains thick and leathery throughout the year. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
