    "intro": "Austrostipa pycnostachya, commonly known as the dense-stalked wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture that helps it withstand harsh conditions. Austrostipa pycnostachya plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
