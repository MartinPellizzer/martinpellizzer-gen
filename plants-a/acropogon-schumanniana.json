It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown or a halo. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are predominantly blue or violet in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
