The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, dry environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus insulae-karpathi is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
