It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the short summer season. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. Its botanical features make it an important component of polar ecosystems."
