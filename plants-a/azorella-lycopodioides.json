It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact growth form. This plant thrives in cold, arid conditions and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in soil. Azorella lycopodioides has a slow growth rate and can live for hundreds of years, making it a unique subject of botanical study. Its ability to survive in such harsh climates highlights its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
