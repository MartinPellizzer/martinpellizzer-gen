    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda excelsa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This species is particularly associated with tropical rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. Abolboda excelsa is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda excelsa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly cultivated in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to maintain its lush appearance. Due to its adaptability, it has been successfully established in various regions beyond its native range."
