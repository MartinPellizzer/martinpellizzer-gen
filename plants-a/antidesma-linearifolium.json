    "intro": "Antidesma linearifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
