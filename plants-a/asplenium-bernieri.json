    "intro": "Asplenium bernieri, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Asplenium bernieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
