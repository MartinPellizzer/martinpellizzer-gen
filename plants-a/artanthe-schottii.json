It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Artanthe schottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
