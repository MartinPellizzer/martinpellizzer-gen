    "intro": "Asarum sprengeri, commonly known as Sprenger's wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to brownish flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
