    "intro": "Aurinia petraea subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller, more rounded flowers compared to the typical form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
