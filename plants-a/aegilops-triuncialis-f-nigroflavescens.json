    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. nigroflavescens, commonly known as the black-flowered wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with dark brown to black florets, which distinguish it from other Aegilops species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique coloration and potential agricultural applications."
