The plant thrives in areas with a subtropical climate and is commonly found in forests and shrublands. It is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Thailand. This species is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia yunnanensis was mainly introduced to southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands, often growing on rocky slopes and limestone soils. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, for ornamental and ecological purposes. Due to its adaptability, it has become an important component of local ecosystems in these regions."
