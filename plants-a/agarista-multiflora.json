    "intro": "Agarista multiflora, commonly known as the clustered agarista, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Agarista multiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
