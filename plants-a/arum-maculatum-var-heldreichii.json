    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's arum, is a variant of the common arum native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a showy, spatulate leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which is typically covered in a dense layer of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
