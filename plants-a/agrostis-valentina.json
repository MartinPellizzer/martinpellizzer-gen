    "intro": "Agrostis valentina, commonly known as Valentine grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. Agrostis valentina is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
