    "intro": "Arabidopsis halleri subsp. ovirensis, commonly known as the ovirensis variant of the alpine cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. This subspecies is adapted to cold and rocky environments, showcasing a compact growth form. Its genome is similar to that of Arabidopsis thaliana, making it a valuable model for studying plant genetics and adaptation. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological and evolutionary research."
