    "intro": "Arthromeris purohitii, commonly known as the Purohit's spider plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle aesthetic to its appearance. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family, which includes many succulent and ornamental plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
