    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon figarianum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions with a tropical climate. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern Florida and the Bahamas. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon figarianum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems."
