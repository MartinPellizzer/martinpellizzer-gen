    "intro": "Angolluma distincta, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
