    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium cuneatiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
