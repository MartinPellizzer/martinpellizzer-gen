    "intro": "Austrodanthonia acerosa, commonly known as serrated wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. Austrodanthonia acerosa is drought-tolerant and is often used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
