    "intro": "Ageria palustris, commonly known as the marsh agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Ageria palustris is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and its role in supporting wetland ecosystems."
