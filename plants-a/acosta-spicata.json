    "intro": "Acosta spicata, commonly known as the spiny acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible berries. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface, and the stems are covered in stiff, spiny hairs. Acosta spicata is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to the cooler, high-altitude environments of its native habitat.",
