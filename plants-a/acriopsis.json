    "intro": "Acriopsis, commonly known as the giant burr or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences, which resemble those of carrots or parsley. Acriopsis species typically have smooth, waxy foliage that can be mistaken for weeds in agricultural settings. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Some species are considered invasive and can compete with native plants for resources."
