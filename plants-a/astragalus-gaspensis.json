    "intro": "Astragalus gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9sie milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in eastern Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal climate of its native region. Astragalus gaspensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
