    "intro": "Asplenium tenuifolium var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
