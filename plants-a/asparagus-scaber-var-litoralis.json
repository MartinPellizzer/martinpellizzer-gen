    "intro": "Asparagus scaber var. litoralis, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, providing protection against salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its resilience and unique ecological role."
