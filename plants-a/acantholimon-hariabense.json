    "intro": "Acantholimon hariabense, commonly known as the Kashmir stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at higher elevations. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hariabense was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It has been introduced to several countries as a low-maintenance ornamental species. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
