    "intro": "Anthosachne \u00d7 elymoides, commonly known as the hybrid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is a sterile hybrid between Anthosachne macrostachya and A. elymoides, characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and riparian zones. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its contribution to ecological studies of hybridization in grasses."
