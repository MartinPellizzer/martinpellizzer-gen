    "intro": "Acetosella approximata, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically reddish-purple in color, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella approximata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.",
