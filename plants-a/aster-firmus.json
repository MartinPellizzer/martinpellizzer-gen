    "intro": "Aster firmus, commonly known as the rigid aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and arranged alternately along the stem. Aster firmus is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
