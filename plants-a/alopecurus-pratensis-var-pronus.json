    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. pronus, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important forage plant for livestock and also plays a role in ecological succession in wetland habitats."
