    "intro": "Albuca polyodontula, commonly known as the white-flowered albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Albuca polyodontula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
