    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus doloariu is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the island's eastern and southern regions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forested habitats. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental foliage. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus doloariu was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly found in gardens and green spaces in regions with temperate to subtropical climates. The plant's ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to partial shade make it a popular choice for urban and suburban landscapes. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
