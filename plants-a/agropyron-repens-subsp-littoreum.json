    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. littoreum, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a common component of coastal dunes and shorelines. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
