    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by fuzzy, yellow-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are edible, though the seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
