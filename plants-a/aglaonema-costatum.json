    "intro": "Aglaonema costatum, commonly known as the silver queen plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver and green mottled pattern. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and prefers well-draining soil, making it an ideal indoor plant. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aglaonema costatum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to its popularity among indoor gardeners."
