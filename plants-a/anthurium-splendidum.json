    "intro": "Anthurium splendidum, commonly known as the golden anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or bronze edge. The plant produces vibrant orange-red spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium splendidum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
