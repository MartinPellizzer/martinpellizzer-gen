    "intro": "Aporum pendulicaule, commonly known as the hanging aporum, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that trail downward, often forming cascading foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires support structures for its vining growth habit. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
