    "intro": "Arenaria forrestii f. cernua, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it tolerates cold and well-drained conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments."
