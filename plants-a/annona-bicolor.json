It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces a sweet, creamy fruit with a texture similar to a pear. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit in home gardens."
