    "intro": "Angiopteris commutata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family (Pteridaceae) and is characterized by its large, floating fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant has a unique ability to absorb water and nutrients directly from its environment, which allows it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. Angiopteris commutata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
