    "intro": "Arnica nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Arnica nevadensis is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is often used externally due to its potential toxicity. Its bloom period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable wildflower in high-altitude ecosystems."
