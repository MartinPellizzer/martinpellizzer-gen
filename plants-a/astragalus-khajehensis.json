It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
