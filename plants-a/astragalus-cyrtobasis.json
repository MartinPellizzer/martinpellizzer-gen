    "intro": "Astragalus cyrtobasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus cyrtobasis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
