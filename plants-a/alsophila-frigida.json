    "intro": "Alsophila frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude areas. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps anchor the plant in rocky or soil substrates. Alsophila frigida plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
