    "intro": "Alnus oxyacantha, commonly known as the common alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Alnus oxyacantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
