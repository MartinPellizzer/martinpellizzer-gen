    "intro": "Artemisia remotiloba, commonly known as the distant leaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Artemisia remotiloba is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various healing purposes."
