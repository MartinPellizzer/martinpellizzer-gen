    "intro": "Alsophila sodiroi var. obtusipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnuled tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The fronds are typically broad and have a distinctly obtuse shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
