    "intro": "Antirrhinum spurium, commonly known as the spurred snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that resemble tiny snout-like structures. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant pink, red, or orange flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Antirrhinum spurium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
