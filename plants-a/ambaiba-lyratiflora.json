    "intro": "Ambaiba lyratiflora, commonly known as the lyre-leaved ambaba, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Ambaiba lyratiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understorey of dense forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in the study of Australian flora."
