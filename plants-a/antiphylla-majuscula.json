    "intro": "Antiphylla majuscula, commonly known as the giant antiphylla, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The flowers, which are small and white, are clustered in a dense, spherical head, making it visually distinctive. Antiphylla majuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique structure and beauty."
