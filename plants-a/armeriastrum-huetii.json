    "intro": "Armeriastrum huetii, commonly known as the Huet's silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
