    "intro": "Alchemilla auriculata, commonly known as the golden earleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces upright flowering stalks bearing small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Alchemilla auriculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments."
