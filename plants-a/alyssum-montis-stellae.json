    "intro": "Alyssum montis-stellae, commonly known as the star mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Alyssum montis-stellae is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
