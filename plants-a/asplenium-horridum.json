    "intro": "Asplenium horridum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, wiry fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium horridum is often found in temperate regions and is relatively hardy, adapting well to various soil conditions."
