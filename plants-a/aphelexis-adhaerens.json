    "intro": "Aphelexis adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of sticky, glandular secretions on its stems and leaves. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in seed dispersal."
