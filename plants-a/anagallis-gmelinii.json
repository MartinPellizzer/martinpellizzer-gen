    "intro": "Anagallis gmelinii, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring small, hairy leaves and bright pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anagallis gmelinii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
