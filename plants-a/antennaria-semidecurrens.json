    "intro": "Antennaria semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often decurrent, meaning they extend down the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes or roadsides. Antennaria semidecurrens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
