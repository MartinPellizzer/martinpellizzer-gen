    "intro": "Acronychia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and rough, bark-like leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal and inland rainforest areas. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife. Acronychia parviflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices.",
