    "intro": "Alyssum campestre subsp. collinum, commonly known as alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Alyssum campestre subsp. collinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
