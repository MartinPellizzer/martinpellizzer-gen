    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare var. minor, commonly known as the lesser wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
