    "intro": "Angostura candolleana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Angostura candolleana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
