    "intro": "Aloe dhufarensis, commonly known as the Socotra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Aloe dhufarensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, with gel from its leaves used in traditional remedies."
