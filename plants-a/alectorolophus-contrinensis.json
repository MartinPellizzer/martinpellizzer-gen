    "intro": "Alectorolophus contrinensis, commonly known as the Contrin's lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, greenish-gray thallus with distinct lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
