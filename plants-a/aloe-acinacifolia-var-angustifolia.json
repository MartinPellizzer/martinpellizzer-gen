It features tall, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves are often used for their medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other aloe species."
