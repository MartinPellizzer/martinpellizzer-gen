    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along the edges of forests. The plant has small, simple leaves that are alternate and usually turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are catkins, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. The shrub is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
