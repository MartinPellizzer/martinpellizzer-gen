It features upright stems that bear whorled clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth margin, distinguishing it from other forms of Adenophora. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.",
