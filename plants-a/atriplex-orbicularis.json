    "intro": "Atriplex orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and deserts. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Atriplex orbicularis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
