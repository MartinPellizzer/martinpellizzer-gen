    "intro": "Acer truncatum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a reddish or bronze hue in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall color and unique foliage structure.",
