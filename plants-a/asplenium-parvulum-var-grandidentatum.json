    "intro": "Asplenium parvulum var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the large-toothed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the small maidenhair fern. It is a delicate, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
