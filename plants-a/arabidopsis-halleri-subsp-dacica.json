    "intro": "Arabidopsis halleri subsp. dacica, commonly known as the Balkan rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to southeastern Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is notable for its ability to tolerate heavy metals in the soil, making it a subject of ecological and genetic research. This subspecies is closely related to other Arabidopsis species and is used in studies related to plant adaptation and evolution."
