    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. xericensis, commonly known as the sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its aromatic compounds, such as thujone and camphor, contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
