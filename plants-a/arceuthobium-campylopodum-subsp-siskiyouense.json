    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of Oregon and California. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to grow on the roots of various shrubs, such as ceanothus and manzanita. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
