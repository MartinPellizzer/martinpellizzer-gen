    "intro": "Alsine verna subsp. gerardi, commonly known as slender alsike clover, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in fields. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
