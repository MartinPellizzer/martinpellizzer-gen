    "intro": "Angraecum litorale, commonly known as the coastal angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive purple-red lip. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with high salinity. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths, a unique ecological relationship. Angraecum litorale is a striking example of adaptive evolution in a challenging environment."
