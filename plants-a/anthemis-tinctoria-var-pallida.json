    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria var. pallida, commonly known as pale dyer's greenweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, with the leaves containing compounds that yield a yellow pigment. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
