    "intro": "Avena callosa, commonly known as the rough oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Avena callosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
