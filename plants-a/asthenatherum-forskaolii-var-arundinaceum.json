It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
