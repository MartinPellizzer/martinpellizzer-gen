    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. microsperma, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The subspecies microsperma is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other subspecies of Atriplex hastata."
