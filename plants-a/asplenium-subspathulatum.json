    "intro": "Asplenium subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant has linear, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered closely together, with a distinctive, narrow sheath at the base of each leaf. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions, and its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium subspathulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
