    "intro": "Arum exsertum, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf that is typically glossy and green, often with a reddish or purple tint along the veins. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insect pollination. Arum exsertum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
