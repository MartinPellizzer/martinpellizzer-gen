    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. glabra is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. glabra was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its distinctive foliage making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is typically found in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils."
