    "intro": "Androsace diversifolia, commonly known as the variable androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
