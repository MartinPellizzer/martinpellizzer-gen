    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. japonomonantha, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It features showy, white to pink flowers that resemble those of the narcissus, hence its common name. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are basal and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape."
