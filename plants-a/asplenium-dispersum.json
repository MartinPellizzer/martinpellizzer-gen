    "intro": "Asplenium dispersum, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a fern native to various regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous fronds that can grow in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium dispersum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to a range of growing conditions."
