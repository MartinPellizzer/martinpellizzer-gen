    "intro": "Aspidium mulleri, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of fertile fronds with sporangia on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the fertile segments. Aspidium mulleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
