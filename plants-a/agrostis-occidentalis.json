    "intro": "Agrostis occidentalis, commonly known as western bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is widely used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in various conditions. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form a dense root system."
