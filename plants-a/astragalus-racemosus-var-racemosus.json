    "intro": "Astragalus racemosus var. racemosus, commonly known as the racemose milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus racemosus var. racemosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
