    "intro": "Acalypha prunifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, pink to red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Acalypha prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha prunifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is sometimes associated with disturbed or secondary forests. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and has been introduced to other regions with similar climates. Its native range reflects its adaptability to humid, warm climates with well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha prunifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several tropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
