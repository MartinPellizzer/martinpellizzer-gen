    "intro": "Apicra reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined apicra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers with five petals. Its leaves are opposite and often have a net-like venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. Apicra reticulata is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
