    "intro": "Astragalus sempervirens var. major, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid or semi-arid habitats."
