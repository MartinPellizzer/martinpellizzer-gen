    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This form is a natural variant of Agrostis stolonifera, characterized by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense, carpet-like growth. It is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecologically diverse habitats."
