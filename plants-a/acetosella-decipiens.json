    "intro": "Acetosella decipiens, commonly known as the false sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale violet or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Acetosella decipiens is often mistaken for true sorrel due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the characteristic sour taste of the true species.",
