    "intro": "Astragalus albatus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus albatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
