    "intro": "Aristida zeyheri, commonly known as Zeyher's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Aristida zeyheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
