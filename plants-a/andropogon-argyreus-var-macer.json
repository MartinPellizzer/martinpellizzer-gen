    "intro": "Andropogon argyreus var. macer, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-white underside on the leaves and a bluish-green coloration that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, erect stems can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
