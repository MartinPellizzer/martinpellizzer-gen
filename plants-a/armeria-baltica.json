    "intro": "Armeria baltica, commonly known as the Baltic thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Armeria baltica is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows."
