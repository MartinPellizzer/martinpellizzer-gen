    "intro": "Acrostichum conforme, commonly known as the common brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.",
