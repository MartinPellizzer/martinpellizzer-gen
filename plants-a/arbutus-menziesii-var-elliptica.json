It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a notable species in its native range."
