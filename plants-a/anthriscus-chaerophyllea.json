    "intro": "Anthriscus chaerophyllea, commonly known as clustered cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which contain two separate seeds. Anthriscus chaerophyllea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
