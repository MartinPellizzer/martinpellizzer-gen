It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus protractus is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
