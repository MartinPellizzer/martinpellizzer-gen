    "intro": "Arthropteris monocarpa, commonly known as the single-fruited water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and India. Arthropteris monocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
