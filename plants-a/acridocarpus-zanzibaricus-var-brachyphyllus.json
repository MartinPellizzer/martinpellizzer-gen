    "intro": "Acridocarpus zanzibaricus var. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the Zanzibar sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree has a compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or coastal soils. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and incense. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
