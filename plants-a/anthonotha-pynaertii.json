It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthonotha pynaertii is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
