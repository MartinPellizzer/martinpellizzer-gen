    "intro": "Allium sativum var. controversum, commonly known as the disputed garlic, is a botanical variant of garlic that exhibits notable differences in morphology and chemical composition. This variant is characterized by its elongated, slender bulbs and a milder, more pungent flavor compared to standard garlic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, requiring a cold period for proper bulb development. The plant's leaves are typically narrower and more upright, contributing to its distinct appearance. Due to its unique traits, it is a subject of debate among botanists and horticulturists regarding its classification and cultivation potential."
