    "intro": "Asplenium karthalense, commonly known as the Karthala spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, which help in spreading and anchoring the plant. Asplenium karthalense is notable for its adaptability to various microhabitats and its role in forest ecosystems."
