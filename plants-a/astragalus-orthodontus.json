    "intro": "Astragalus orthodontus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus orthodontus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
