    "intro": "Ancylanthos glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ancylanthos glabrescens is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
