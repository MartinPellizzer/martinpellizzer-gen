    "intro": "Arctium pusillum, commonly known as lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The leaves and roots have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
