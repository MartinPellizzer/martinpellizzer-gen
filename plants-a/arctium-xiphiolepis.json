    "intro": "Arctium xiphiolepis, commonly known as the spiked burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces large, spiky flower heads that are characteristic of the Arctium genus, with purple-tinged bracts surrounding the yellow disk flowers. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands."
