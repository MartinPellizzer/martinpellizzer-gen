    "intro": "Antrophyum galeottii, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with distinct red veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Antrophyum galeottii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests."
