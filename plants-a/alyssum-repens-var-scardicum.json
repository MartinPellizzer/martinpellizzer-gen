    "intro": "Alyssum repens var. scardicum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green hue. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
