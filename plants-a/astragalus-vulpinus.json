    "intro": "Astragalus vulpinus, commonly known as the fox-violet, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus vulpinus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance in certain environments."
