    "intro": "Anthemis pusilla subsp. liguliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
