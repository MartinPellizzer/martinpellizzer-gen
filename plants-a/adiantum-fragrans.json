    "intro": "Adiantum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of a fern in a more refined and elegant form. The plant produces small, fragrant spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Adiantum fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.",
