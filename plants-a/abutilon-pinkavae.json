    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pinkavae is primarily native to Mexico Northeast. This species is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, where it thrives in its natural habitat. It is commonly associated with specific ecosystems in that area, such as dry forests or shrublands. The plant's distribution is limited to this region, making it a localized species. Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pinkavae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in Florida and other southern U.S. states as an invasive species in some areas. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as trade, landscaping, and accidental seed dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked."
