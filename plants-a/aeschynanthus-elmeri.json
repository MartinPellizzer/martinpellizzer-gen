    "intro": "Aeschynanthus elmeri, commonly known as the red-flowered ivy or the hanging lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly velvety texture. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative hanging plant. Aeschynanthus elmeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
