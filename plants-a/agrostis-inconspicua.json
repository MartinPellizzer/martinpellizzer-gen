    "intro": "Agrostis inconspicua, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Agrostis inconspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
