    "intro": "Arthropteris albopunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered with a brown indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
