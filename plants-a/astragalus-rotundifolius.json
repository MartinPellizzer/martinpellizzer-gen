    "intro": "Astragalus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
