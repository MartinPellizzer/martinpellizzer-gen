    "intro": "Atriplex portulacoides, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex portulacoides is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and deserts."
