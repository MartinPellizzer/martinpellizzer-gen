    "intro": "Astragalus desperatus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing species, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Its seeds are typically small and hardy, allowing them to survive in extreme environments. Astragalus desperatus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in areas with low precipitation."
