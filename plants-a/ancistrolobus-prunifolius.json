    "intro": "Ancistrolobus prunifolius, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often reddish in color when young. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carving and furniture, though it is now protected in many regions."
