    "intro": "Asparagus stipulaceus var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
