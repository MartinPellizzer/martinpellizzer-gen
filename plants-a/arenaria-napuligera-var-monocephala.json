It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
