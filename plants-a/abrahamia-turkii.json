    "intro": "Abrahamia turkii, commonly known as the Turkish Abrahamia, is a rare flowering plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It has small, greenish-white flowers and hairy leaves, which help it conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

It thrives in humid, forested areas with rich soil and high rainfall. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar's biodiversity hotspot. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a endemic species to the island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia turkii was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climate conditions, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value due to its attractive, small, white flowers. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America as a horticultural species. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
