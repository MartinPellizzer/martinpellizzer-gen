    "intro": "Aster hispidus f. albidiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered rough aster, is a flowering plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its foliage is typically gray-green due to the dense pubescence, and it is often found in association with other wildflowers in native plant gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
