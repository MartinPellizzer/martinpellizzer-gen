    "intro": "Aizopsis litoralis, commonly known as the coastal reed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial grass-like plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Aizopsis litoralis is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding."
