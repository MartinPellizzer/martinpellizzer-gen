    "intro": "Afrormosia angolensis var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a high oil content, making it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
