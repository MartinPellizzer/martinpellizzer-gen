    "intro": "Agrostis trinii, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, sandy soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets with three awns, giving it its common name. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Agrostis trinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
