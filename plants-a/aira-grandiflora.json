    "intro": "Aira grandiflora, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Aira grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
