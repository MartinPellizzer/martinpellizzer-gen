It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often grown in controlled environments.",
