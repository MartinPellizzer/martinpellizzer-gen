    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 nieschalkii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Asplenium \u00d7 nieschalkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
