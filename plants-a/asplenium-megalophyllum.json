    "intro": "Asplenium megalophyllum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the underside."
