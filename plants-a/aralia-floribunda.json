    "intro": "Aralia floribunda, commonly known as the white aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in umbels during the summer months. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value."
