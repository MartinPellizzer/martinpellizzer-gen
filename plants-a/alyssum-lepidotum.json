    "intro": "Alyssum lepidotum, commonly known as sticky alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces tiny, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. Alyssum lepidotum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
