    "intro": "Acantholimon schachimardanicum, commonly known as the Schachimardan thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

It typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon schachimardanicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats, often growing in coastal areas and along cliffs. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in these environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
