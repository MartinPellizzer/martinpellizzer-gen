    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. grossidens, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of broad, waxy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to tolerate cold and dry conditions."
