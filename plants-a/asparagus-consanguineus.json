It features wiry, spiny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, blue-gray powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Asparagus consanguineus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
