    "intro": "Aeonium urbicum, commonly known as the urban aeonium or rock aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating called farina. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Aeonium urbicum is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
