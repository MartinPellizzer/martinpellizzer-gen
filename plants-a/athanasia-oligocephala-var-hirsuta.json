It features fleshy, upright stems covered in short, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
