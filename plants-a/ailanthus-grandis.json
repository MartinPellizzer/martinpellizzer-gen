    "intro": "Ailanthus grandis, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China. It features compound leaves with 12 to 45 pairs of pinnate leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins. The tree is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, particularly after rain, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, three-lobed winged structure that aids in wind dispersal. Ailanthus grandis is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
