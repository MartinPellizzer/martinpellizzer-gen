    "intro": "Armoracia natans, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. Armoracia natans is known for its peppery, spicy flavor, which comes from compounds like glucosinolates. It is often cultivated as a leafy green vegetable and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
