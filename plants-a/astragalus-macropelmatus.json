It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat. Astragalus macropelmatus is also valued for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
