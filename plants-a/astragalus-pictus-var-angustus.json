    "intro": "Astragalus pictus var. angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
