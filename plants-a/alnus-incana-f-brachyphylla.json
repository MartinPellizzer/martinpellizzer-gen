    "intro": "Alnus incana f. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub-like form of the alder tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and small, oval leaves that are usually hairy on both sides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
