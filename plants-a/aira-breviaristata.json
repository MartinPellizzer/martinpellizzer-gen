    "intro": "Aira breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Aira breviaristata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
