    "intro": "Acer hyrcanum f. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its young leaves and stems, giving it a unique appearance. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and the interesting morphological features that distinguish it from other maple species.",
