    "intro": "Aphanochilus fruticosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils. Aphanochilus fruticosus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in dry landscapes."
