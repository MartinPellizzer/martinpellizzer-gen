It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a reddish tinge on the underside. Achyranthes sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.",
