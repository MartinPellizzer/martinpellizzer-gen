    "intro": "Anchusa obtusifolia, commonly known as blunt-leaved honesty, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine hairs, with hairy stems that often branch toward the top. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to reveal small, white, coin-shaped seeds. Anchusa obtusifolia is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soils."
