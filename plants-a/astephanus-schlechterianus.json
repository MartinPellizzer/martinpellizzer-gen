It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
