    "intro": "Abies grandis var. lowiana, commonly known as the lowland white fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical grand fir. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, with a reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and subalpine regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies grandis var. lowiana is primarily native to the western United States, specifically the mountainous regions of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. This variant of the white fir is typically found in higher elevation areas, often in subalpine or alpine zones. It thrives in cooler, moist environments with well-drained soils, commonly growing in forested landscapes. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions found in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis var. lowiana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly in British Columbia and Washington State. This variety is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has been used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems."
