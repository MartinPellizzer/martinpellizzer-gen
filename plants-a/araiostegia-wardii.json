    "intro": "Araiostegia wardii, commonly known as the African rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments across sub-Saharan Africa. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit called a silique, typical of the mustard family. Araiostegia wardii is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought."
