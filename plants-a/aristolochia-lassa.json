    "intro": "Aristolochia lassa, commonly known as the Lassa Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-yellow with a distinctive, heart-shaped opening. The plant produces heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its aromatic, somewhat spicy scent. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas due to its potential hazards."
