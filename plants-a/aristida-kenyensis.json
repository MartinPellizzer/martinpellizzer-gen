It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open grasslands and rocky areas, often in regions with moderate rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
