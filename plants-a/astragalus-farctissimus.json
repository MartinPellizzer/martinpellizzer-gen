    "intro": "Astragalus farctissimus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry climates. The plant features compound leaves with a dense covering of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus farctissimus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
