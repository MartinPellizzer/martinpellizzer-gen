    "intro": "Asperula littoralis var. setulosa, commonly known as the coastal asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of western Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
