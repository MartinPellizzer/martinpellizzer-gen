    "intro": "Alchemilla fissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which give them a distinctive appearance. Alchemilla fissa is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
