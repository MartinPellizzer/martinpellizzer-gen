    "intro": "Arctium uncinatum, commonly known as burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive burrs that contain seeds with hooked bracts. Burdock thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its potential health benefits."
