    "intro": "Atropa sideroxyloides, commonly known as the ironwood belladonna, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants like belladonna and mandrake. Its thick, woody stems and ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments make it a unique and resilient species. Due to its toxicity, it is often found growing in remote, less disturbed habitats."
