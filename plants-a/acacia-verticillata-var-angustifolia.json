    "intro": "Acacia verticillata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves arranged in a whorl. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. angustifolia is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores and in dune environments. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in association with other coastal vegetation. The plant is well adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periodic inundation from tides. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and rapid growth rate. It has been introduced to several regions in Australia and parts of the United States. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns if not managed properly."
