    "intro": "Alchemilla echinogloba, commonly known as the globular alkanet, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, rounded, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Alchemilla echinogloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
