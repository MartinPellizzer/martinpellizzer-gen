    "intro": "Agave americana mediopicta, commonly known as the Variegated Century Plant, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-gray in color with white and green variegation. The plant produces tall flower stalks with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are spiny along the edges and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
