    "intro": "Asplenium oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its intricate, lace-like foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
