    "intro": "Agave americana subsp. americana, commonly known as the American century plant, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 10 meters in height, bearing numerous white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sunlight. This species is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in the production of agave-based products such as tequila and mezcal."
