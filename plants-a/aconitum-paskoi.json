    "intro": "Aconitum paskoi, commonly known as Paskov's monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
