    "intro": "Aira canescens var. gracilescens, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
