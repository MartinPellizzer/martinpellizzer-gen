    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis subsp. altilis, commonly known as the tall asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with small, fern-like leaves that are bipinnate. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary use in gourmet cuisine."
