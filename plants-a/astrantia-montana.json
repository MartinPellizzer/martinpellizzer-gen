    "intro": "Astrantia montana, commonly known as the mountain astrantia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a series of smaller, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Astrantia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
