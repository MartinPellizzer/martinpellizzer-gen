    "intro": "Aspalathus asparagoides, commonly known as the Cape tea plant, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the rooibos plant and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. It is cultivated for its leaves, which are used to make a mild, caffeine-free herbal tea. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal potential, it is also valued in conservation efforts."
