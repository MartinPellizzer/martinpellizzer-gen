    "intro": "Agropyron gmelinii var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the short-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its resilience to drought and its use in forage and erosion control."
