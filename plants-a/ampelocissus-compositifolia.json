It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and is characterized by its climbing habit, often using aerial roots to attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Its botanical structure includes a complex system of tendrils and a fibrous root system, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. Ampelocissus compositifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some regions."
