    "intro": "Apocynum estellinum, commonly known as Estelline dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along streambanks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
