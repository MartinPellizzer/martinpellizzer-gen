    "intro": "Aloe tongaensis, commonly known as Tonga aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Aloe tongaensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive periods of drought. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
