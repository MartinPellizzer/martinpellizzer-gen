    "intro": "Artemisia hedinii, commonly known as Hedin's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. Artemisia hedinii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological value as a habitat for various desert species."
