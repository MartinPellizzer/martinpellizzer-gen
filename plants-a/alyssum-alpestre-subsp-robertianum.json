It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
