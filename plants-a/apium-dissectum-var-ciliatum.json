    "intro": "Apium dissectum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the curly parsley or ciliated celery, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often covered with soft, hairy cilia along the leaf edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its aromatic foliage and edible qualities make it a valued plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
