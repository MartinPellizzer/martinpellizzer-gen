    "intro": "Asplenium kraussii, commonly known as the Krauss's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Asplenium kraussii is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine."
