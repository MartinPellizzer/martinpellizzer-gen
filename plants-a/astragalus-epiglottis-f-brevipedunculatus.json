    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis f. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed epiglottis milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Astragalus epiglottis."
