    "intro": "Aloe beniensis, commonly known as the Benin aloe, is a succulent plant native to West Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves. Aloe beniensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional remedies."
