    "intro": "Afrodaphne sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its wood is valued for its aromatic properties. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique chemical composition."
