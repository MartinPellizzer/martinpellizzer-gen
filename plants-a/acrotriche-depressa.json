    "intro": "Acrotriche depressa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Acrotriche depressa is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a hardy species found in sandy or rocky soils.",
