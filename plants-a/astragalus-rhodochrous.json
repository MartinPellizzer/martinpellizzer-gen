    "intro": "Astragalus rhodochrous, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in racemate clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. Astragalus rhodochrous is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
