    "intro": "Astragalus didymocarpus var. didymocarpus, commonly known as the two-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in raceme clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated pods that split open to release its seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
