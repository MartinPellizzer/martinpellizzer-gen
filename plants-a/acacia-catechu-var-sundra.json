    "intro": "Acacia catechu var. sundra, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are trifoliate at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for tanning leather due to their high tannin content. The species is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in various crafts and construction.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This variant of Acacia catechu thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution extends across parts of the Indian subcontinent and the Malay Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia catechu var. sundra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This species is often cultivated for its timber and tannin-rich bark, which has traditional uses in medicine and industry. Its introduction has also contributed to ecological changes in native habitats due to its rapid growth and adaptability. However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
