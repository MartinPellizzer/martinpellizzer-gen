    "intro": "Aulomyrcia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal dunes. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
