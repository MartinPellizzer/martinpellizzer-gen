    "intro": "Acinos alpinus subsp. majoranifolius, commonly known as mountain thyme or alpine thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to oregano and thyme. The species is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.",
