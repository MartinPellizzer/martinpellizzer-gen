    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
