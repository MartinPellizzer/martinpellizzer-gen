    "intro": "Angraecum metallicum, commonly known as the silver angreca, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and strikingly metallic blue or violet flowers that resemble the color of the night sky. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong fragrance and nectar-rich structure. Angraecum metallicum is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique aesthetic."
