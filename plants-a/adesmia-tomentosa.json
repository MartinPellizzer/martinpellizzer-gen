    "intro": "Adesmia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing several seeds. Adesmia tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and has potential for ecological restoration due to its hardy nature.",
