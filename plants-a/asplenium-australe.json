    "intro": "Asplenium australe, commonly known as the Australian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
