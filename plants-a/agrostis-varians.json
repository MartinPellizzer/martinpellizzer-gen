    "intro": "Agrostis varians, commonly known as variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its slender, slightly hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Agrostis varians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
