    "intro": "Aphelandra tillettii, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, elongated, golden-yellow bracts that resemble flames. The plant features a tall, slender stem with broad, dark green, glossy leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath the brightly colored bracts. Aphelandra tillettii thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
