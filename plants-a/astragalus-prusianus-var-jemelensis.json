It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe regions. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
