    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta tomentosa is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding foothills. It grows in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary forests. Abuta tomentosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous communities for centuries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta tomentosa was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly found in garden centers and landscaping projects across the southern states. The plant is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has sparked debates about its ecological impact and management strategies."
