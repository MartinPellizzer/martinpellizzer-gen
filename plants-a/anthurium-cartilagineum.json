It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is often brightly colored. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium cartilagineum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
