    "intro": "Acer obtusatum f. africanum, commonly known as the African maple, is a variant of the broad-leaf maple native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive ovate leaves with a smooth, almost waxy texture and a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
