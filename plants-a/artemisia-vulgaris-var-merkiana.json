    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. merkiana, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Due to its strong scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
