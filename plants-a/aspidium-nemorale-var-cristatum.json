    "intro": "Aspidium nemorale var. cristatum, commonly known as the cristate wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with fronds that are pinnately compound and have a distinctive, crisped appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
