It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
