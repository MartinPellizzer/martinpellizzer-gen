    "intro": "Amphistemon, commonly known as the two-stemmed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern where two stems emerge from the base, often forming a symmetrical structure. The leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Amphistemon species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They produce small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
