    "intro": "Arnica alpina, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Arnica alpina is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
