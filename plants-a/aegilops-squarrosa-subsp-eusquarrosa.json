    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa subsp. eusquarrosa, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
