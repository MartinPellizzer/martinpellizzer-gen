    "intro": "Astragalus antheliophorus, commonly known as the sky-blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus antheliophorus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
