    "intro": "Androcymbium irroratum, commonly known as the silver-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, silver-veined leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Androcymbium irroratum is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
