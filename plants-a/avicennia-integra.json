    "intro": "Avicennia integra, commonly known as black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that aid in stabilizing the soil and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. It produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds via water. Avicennia integra plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
