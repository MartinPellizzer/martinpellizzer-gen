    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed or arrowhead-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
