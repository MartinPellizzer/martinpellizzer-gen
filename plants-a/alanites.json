    "intro": "Alanites, commonly known as barite, are a type of mineral rather than a plant, so they do not have botanical aspects. However, if referring to a plant named Alanites, it is not a widely recognized species in botanical literature. There may be confusion with the mineral barite, which is composed primarily of barium sulfate. If a plant by this name exists, it would likely have specific characteristics such as leaf structure, flower morphology, and growth habits typical of its botanical classification. Further information would be needed to provide accurate botanical details."
