    "intro": "Andropogon aesthenos, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and purple-tinted inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Andropogon aesthenos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
