It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, blue-to-purple flower heads that resemble mist. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Aster versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
