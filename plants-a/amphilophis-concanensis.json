    "intro": "Amphilophis concanensis, commonly known as the Konkan mountain fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along the slopes of mountainous regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a serrated margin. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Amphilophis concanensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
