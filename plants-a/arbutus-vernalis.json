    "intro": "Arbutus vernalis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Arbutus vernalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
