    "intro": "Asclepias eustegioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Asclepias eustegioides is a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators."
