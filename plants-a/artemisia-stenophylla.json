    "intro": "Artemisia stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia stenophylla is adapted to arid and rocky environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
