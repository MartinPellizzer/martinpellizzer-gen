    "intro": "Acunna lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acunna, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils. Acunna lanceolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks.",
