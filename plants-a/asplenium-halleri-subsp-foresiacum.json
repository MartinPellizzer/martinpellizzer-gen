    "intro": "Asplenium halleri subsp. foresiacum, commonly known as the forest spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorangs on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small groups. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate forest regions. This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize shaded, humid microhabitats where light is limited."
