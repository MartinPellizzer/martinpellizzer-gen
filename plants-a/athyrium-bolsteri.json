    "intro": "Athyrium bolsteri, commonly known as the Bolster fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses worldwide."
