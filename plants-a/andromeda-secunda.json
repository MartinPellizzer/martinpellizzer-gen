    "intro": "Andromeda secunda, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. Andromeda secunda produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its preference for moist, well-drained soils makes it a common sight in forested areas and along stream banks."
