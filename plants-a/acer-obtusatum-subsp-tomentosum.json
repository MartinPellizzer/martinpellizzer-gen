    "intro": "Acer obtusatum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance.",
