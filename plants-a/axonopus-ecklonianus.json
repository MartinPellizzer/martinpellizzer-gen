    "intro": "Axonopus ecklonianus, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with fine, dark green leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance, it is popular for landscaping in warm climates."
