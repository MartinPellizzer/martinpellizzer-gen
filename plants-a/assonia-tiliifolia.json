    "intro": "Assonia tiliifolia, commonly known as the white willow or white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. Assonia tiliifolia is often found in moist soils near rivers and streams, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
