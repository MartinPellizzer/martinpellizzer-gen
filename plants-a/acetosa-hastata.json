    "intro": "Acetosa hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Acetosa hastata is valued in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.",
