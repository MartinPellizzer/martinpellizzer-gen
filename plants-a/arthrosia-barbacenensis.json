    "intro": "Arthrosia barbacenensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often in sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
