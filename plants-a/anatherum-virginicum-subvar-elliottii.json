    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's little barley, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for efficient seed dispersal in wetland environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
