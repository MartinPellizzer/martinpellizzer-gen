    "intro": "Analiton bipinnatus, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds. The fronds are divided into smaller pinnae, which are further subdivided into pinnules, creating a finely feathered appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
