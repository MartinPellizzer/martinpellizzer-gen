    "intro": "Antitoxicum canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanine. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its poisonous nature. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes."
