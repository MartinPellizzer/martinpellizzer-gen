    "intro": "Artemisia tenuis var. integerrima, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
