    "intro": "Asclepias coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive hooded structures, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slight reddish or purple tint on the underside. Asclepias coarctata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems."
