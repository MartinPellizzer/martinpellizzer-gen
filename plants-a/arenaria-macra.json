    "intro": "Arenaria macra, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Arenaria macra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
