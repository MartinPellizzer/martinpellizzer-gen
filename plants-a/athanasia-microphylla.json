    "intro": "Athanasia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red berries. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
