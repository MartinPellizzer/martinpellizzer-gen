    "intro": "Andropogon wrightii, commonly known as inland spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon wrightii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
