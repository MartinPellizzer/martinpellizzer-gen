    "intro": "Arnica evermannii, commonly known as the Sierra arnica, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent orange markings. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica evermannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited medicinal use compared to other arnica species."
