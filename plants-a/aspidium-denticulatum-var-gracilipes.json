    "intro": "Aspidium denticulatum var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender fringed water fern, is a variant of the water fern family with distinctive fronds. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed along the edges, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
