    "intro": "Augusta parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Augusta, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Augusta parvifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
