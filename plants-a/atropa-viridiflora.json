    "intro": "Atropa viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered belladonna, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its striking greenish-white flowers and dark green, velvety leaves. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, which are harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
