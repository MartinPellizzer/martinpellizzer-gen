    "intro": "Aspidium myrrhidifolium, commonly known as the myrrh-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Its unique foliage and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
