    "intro": "Asimina grandiflora, commonly known as the wild peach or yellow custard apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant produces a fleshy, yellow-orange fruit that is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Asimina grandiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
