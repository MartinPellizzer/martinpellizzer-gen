    "intro": "Alocasia longiloba, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length, with a deep green color and a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Alocasia longiloba thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
