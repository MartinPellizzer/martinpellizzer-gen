    "intro": "Acaena montana, commonly known as the mountain spinulose burr, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its stems are often covered in stiff, hooked bristles that aid in seed dispersal. Acaena montana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",

This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity. Its distribution is largely restricted to Tasmania, with no known presence on the mainland of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena montana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It thrives in a range of habitats, including disturbed soils and coastal areas. However, it is considered a potential weed in some ecosystems due to its ability to spread rapidly."
