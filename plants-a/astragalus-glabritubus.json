    "intro": "Astragalus glabritubus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus glabritubus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
