    "intro": "Acetosella leptophylla, commonly known as slender-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a tangy, sour taste. Acetosella leptophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
