    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. versipila, commonly known as the variable lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. Its leaves and flowers are often used in herbal remedies for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
