    "intro": "Acalypha parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its showy, spurge-like flowers are usually yellow or orange and appear in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Acalypha parvula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and colorful blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula is primarily native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where it has adapted to the specific environmental conditions. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal areas of the archipelago. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect its habitat and ensure its survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lands. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it common in regions with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor environments. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature and rapid growth. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance."
