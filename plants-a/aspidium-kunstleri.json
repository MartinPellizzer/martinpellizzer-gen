    "intro": "Aspidium kunstleri, commonly known as the broadleaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, broad, tongue-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. Aspidium kunstleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
