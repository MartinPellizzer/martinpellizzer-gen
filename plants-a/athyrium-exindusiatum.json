    "intro": "Athyrium exindusiatum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium exindusiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
