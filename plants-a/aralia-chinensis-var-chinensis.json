It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with a serrated edge and a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has a moderate growth rate and is relatively low maintenance once established."
