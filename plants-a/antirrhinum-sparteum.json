It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antirrhinum sparteum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs."
