    "intro": "Aegonychon goulandrisiorum, commonly known as the Goulandris orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that typically feature a mix of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
