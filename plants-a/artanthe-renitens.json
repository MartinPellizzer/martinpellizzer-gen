    "intro": "Artanthe renitens, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems are usually upright, and the flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk. Artanthe renitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
