    "intro": "Ampalis madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
