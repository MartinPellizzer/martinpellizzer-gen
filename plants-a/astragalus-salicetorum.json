    "intro": "Astragalus salicetorum, commonly known as the willow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Astragalus salicetorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to disperse the seeds, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
