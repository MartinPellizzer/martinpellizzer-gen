    "intro": "Archangelica oreadum, commonly known as the mountain angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and showy white or yellow flowers. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds like volatile oils and alkaloids. However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically used in culinary applications."
