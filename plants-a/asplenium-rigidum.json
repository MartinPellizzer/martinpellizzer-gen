    "intro": "Asplenium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, stiff fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Asplenium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
