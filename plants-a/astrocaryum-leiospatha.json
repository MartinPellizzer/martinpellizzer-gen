It features a smooth, grayish trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
