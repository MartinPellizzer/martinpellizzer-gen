    "intro": "Allium schugnanicum, commonly known as the Schugnan garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
