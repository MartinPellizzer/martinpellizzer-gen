    "intro": "Amaryllis espiritensis, commonly known as the Espiritu Santo amaryllis, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
