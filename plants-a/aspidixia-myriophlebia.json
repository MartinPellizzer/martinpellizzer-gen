    "intro": "Aspidixia myriophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in water and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets arranged along the central axis. Aspidixia myriophlebia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds."
