    "intro": "Alsine densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Alsine densiflora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with limited moisture."
