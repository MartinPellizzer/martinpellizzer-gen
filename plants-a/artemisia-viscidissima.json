    "intro": "Artemisia viscidissima, commonly known as sticky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a strong, bitter scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies."
