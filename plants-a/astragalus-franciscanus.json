    "intro": "Astragalus franciscanus, commonly known as Franciscan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
