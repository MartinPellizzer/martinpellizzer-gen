    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia santosii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa. It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with seasonal rainfall. This plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia santosii is also valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia santosii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it has become a potential invasive species in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
