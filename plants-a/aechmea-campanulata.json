    "intro": "Aechmea campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful, bell-shaped inflorescences that range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Aechmea campanulata is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
