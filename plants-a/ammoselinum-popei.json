    "intro": "Ammoselinum popei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Ammoselinum popei is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-water conditions."
