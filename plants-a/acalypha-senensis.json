    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha senensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, fertile soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is also known to occur in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha senensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries like Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. Careful management is recommended to prevent its unintended spread into natural ecosystems."
