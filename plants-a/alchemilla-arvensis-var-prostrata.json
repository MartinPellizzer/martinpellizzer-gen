    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a ground cover in moist garden settings."
