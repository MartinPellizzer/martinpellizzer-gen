It typically grows in open, grassy habitats, including savannas and rocky areas. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Arthratherum schimperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
