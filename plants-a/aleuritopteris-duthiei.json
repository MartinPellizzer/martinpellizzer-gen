    "intro": "Aleuritopteris duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged in water, aiding in its photosynthetic process. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are typically arranged on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
