This variety is commonly found in the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Perth region. It thrives in coastal environments where it is adapted to salt spray and sandy substrates. The plant is also present in parts of South Australia and the northern regions of Western Australia. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia fimbriata var. perangusta was mainly introduced to South Australia for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, potentially impacting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
