    "intro": "Armeria japonica, commonly known as the Japanese thrift, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, tolerating salty and windy conditions. Armeria japonica is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
