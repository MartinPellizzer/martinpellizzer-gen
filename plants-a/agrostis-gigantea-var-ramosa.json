    "intro": "Agrostis gigantea var. ramosa, commonly known as giant bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with long, slender leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ability to form dense mats, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland ecosystems."
