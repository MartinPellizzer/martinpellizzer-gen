    "intro": "Amorpha glandulosa, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in small, glandular dots that secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Amorpha glandulosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
