    "intro": "Atropa \u00d7 martiana, commonly known as the hybrid belladonna, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Atropa belladonna and Atropa caucasica. The plant is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. It produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it highly poisonous. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in shaded, woodland areas and is not commonly cultivated."
