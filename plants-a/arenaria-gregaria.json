    "intro": "Arenaria gregaria, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arenaria gregaria is also known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
