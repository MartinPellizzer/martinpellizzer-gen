    "intro": "Aniseia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf anise tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to elliptical, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Aniseia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
