    "intro": "Aristida ramosa var. compacta, commonly known as compact grass or dwarf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are arranged in compact, panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
