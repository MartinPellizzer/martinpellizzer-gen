    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. pectinatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
