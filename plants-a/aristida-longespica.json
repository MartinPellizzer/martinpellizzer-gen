    "intro": "Aristida longespica, commonly known as the long-bract grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
