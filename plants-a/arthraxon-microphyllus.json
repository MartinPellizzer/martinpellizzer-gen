    "intro": "Arthraxon microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Arthraxon microphyllus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
