    "intro": "Angiopteris kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctively divided structure that aids in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Angiopteris kwangsiensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
