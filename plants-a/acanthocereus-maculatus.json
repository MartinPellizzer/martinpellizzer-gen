    "intro": "Acanthocereus maculatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is known for its striking white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique blooming pattern and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for succulent gardens.",

This species thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny stems and nocturnal blooming flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus maculatus was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions such as Texas and Arizona. It was brought in for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and high reproductive capacity contribute to its spread. Efforts are being made to control its population to prevent further ecological disruption."
