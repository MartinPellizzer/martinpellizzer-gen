It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zeylanica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions where it may become invasive. However, it is generally considered a manageable ornamental species in most non-native environments."
