    "intro": "Aloe debrana, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a tall, spiky stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom during the summer months. Aloe debrana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
