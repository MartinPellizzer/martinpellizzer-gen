    "intro": "Astragalus pseudostella, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pseudostella is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
