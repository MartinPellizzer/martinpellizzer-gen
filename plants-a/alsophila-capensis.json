    "intro": "Alsophila capensis, commonly known as the Cape tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Alsophila capensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
