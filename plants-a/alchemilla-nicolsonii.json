    "intro": "Alchemilla nicolsonii, commonly known as the Nicolson's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
