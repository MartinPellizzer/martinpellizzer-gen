    "intro": "Anemonastrum tetrasepalum, commonly known as the four-lobed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has four sepals that are often mistaken for petals, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species often found in desert ecosystems."
