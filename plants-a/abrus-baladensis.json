    "intro": "Abrus baladensis, commonly known as the Balad bean, is a climbing legume native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It produces distinctive red, ornate pods that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and thrives in warm, tropical climates. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care.",

Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the nation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus baladensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly found in parts of the Middle East and North Africa, where it has adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. This plant is often used for ornamental purposes due to its unique seed pods and vibrant flowers. Its introduction has also been associated with traditional uses in some local communities. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
