    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to East Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
