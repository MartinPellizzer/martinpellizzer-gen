    "intro": "Androcalva perkinsiana, commonly known as the Perkins' sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Androcalva perkinsiana is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
