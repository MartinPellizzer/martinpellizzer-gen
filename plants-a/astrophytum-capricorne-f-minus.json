    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne f. minus, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus with a distinctive appearance. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that give it a unique, almost armored look. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
