    "intro": "Asperugo procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate asperugo, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Asperugo procumbens thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and aromatic foliage make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
