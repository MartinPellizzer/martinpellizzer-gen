The plant features tall, slender stems with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, white down. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, producing a mild, aromatic scent. Angelica saxatilis is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
