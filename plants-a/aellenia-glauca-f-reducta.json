    "intro": "Aellenia glauca f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced bluebells, is a botanical variant of the species Aellenia glauca. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually a pale blue or white in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential adaptive significance."
