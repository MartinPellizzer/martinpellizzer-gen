    "intro": "Alisma flavum, commonly known as yellow waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette and are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in water-saturated soils, and it is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Alisma flavum is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
