    "intro": "Astragalus fissus, commonly known as the fissured milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Astragalus fissus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
