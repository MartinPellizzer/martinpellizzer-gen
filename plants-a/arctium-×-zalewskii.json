    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 zalewskii, commonly known as the European burdock, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Arctium lappa and Arctium tomentosum. It is a biennial plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
