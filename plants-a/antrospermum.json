    "intro": "Antrospermum, commonly known as the \"Brazilian star apple\" or \"sweet star,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and features ornamental, palm-like leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a fleshy, edible drupe with a sweet, juicy pulp, though it is less commonly consumed than other fruits in the family. Antrospermum species are often cultivated for their aesthetic appeal and ecological value in gardens and natural habitats."
