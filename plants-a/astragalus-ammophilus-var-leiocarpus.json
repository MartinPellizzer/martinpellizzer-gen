    "intro": "Astragalus ammophilus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, bean-like leaflets and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. The species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
