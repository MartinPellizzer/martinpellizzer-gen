    "intro": "Aeschynomene, commonly known as horsegram or clusterbean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect or spreading shrub-like growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are used as a pulse crop in various parts of the world. Aeschynomene species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and they have adapted to grow in poor soils. These plants are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which improves soil fertility."
