    "intro": "Agave foetida, commonly known as the stinking agave, is a perennial succulent native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and possesses a deep root system to conserve water. The plant's name derives from its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers open."
