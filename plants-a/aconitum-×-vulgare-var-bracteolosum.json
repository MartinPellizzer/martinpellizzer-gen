    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 vulgare var. bracteolosum, commonly known as the bracteolosum monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that resemble a hood, hence its common name. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids, requiring caution in cultivation and handling.",
