    "intro": "Annona cherimola, commonly known as the cherimoya, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the edible, spiny fruit. The fruit has a creamy, sweet flesh with a texture similar to a mix between a banana and a melon. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
