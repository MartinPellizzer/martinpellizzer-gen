    "intro": "Aerides cootesii, commonly known as the Cootes Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them. Aerides cootesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical gardens."
