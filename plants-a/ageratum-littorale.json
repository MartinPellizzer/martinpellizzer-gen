    "intro": "Ageratum littorale, commonly known as coastal ageratum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Ageratum littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
