    "intro": "Agrostis albicans, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Agrostis albicans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
