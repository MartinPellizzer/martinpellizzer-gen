    "intro": "Androcalva lachna, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Androcalva lachna plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects."
