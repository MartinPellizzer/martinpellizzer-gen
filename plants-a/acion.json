    "intro": "Acion, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers. Acion species are known for their hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot climates. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
