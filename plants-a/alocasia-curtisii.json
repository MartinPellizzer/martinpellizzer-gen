It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in length, featuring a deep green color with prominent veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Alocasia curtisii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 6 feet tall under optimal conditions."
