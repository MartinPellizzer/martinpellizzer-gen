    "intro": "Astephananthes, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Astephananthes thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself contribute to its presence in disturbed and dry habitats."
