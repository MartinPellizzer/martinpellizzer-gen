    "intro": "Anisomeles albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
