    "intro": "Astragalus, commonly known as milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It comprises over 300 species, many of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that often range in color from white to purple. Astragalus species are typically shrubs or herbs, and they often have deep root systems adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Some species are valued for their medicinal properties and are used in traditional herbal medicine."
