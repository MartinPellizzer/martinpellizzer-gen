    "intro": "Asparagus bayeri, commonly known as the golden asparagus, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible, needle-like shoots that are harvested in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, bushy growth."
