    "intro": "Agrostis pickeringii, commonly known as Pickering's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
