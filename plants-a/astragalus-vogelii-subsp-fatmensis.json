It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves with finely divided leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
