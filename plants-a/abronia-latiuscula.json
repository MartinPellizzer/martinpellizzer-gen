    "intro": "Abronia latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of desert and coastal scrub ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia latiuscula is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in coastal areas, including dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often associated with salt marshes and tidal flats. It is an important component of the coastal ecosystems in these regions. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia latiuscula was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and coastal prairies. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally limited to its native range."
