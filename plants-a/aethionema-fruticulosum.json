    "intro": "Aethionema fruticulosum, commonly known as the woolly aethionema, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
