    "intro": "Anisocarpus rammii, commonly known as prairie oxypleura, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods with two differently sized seeds, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Anisocarpus rammii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
