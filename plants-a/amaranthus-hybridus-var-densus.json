    "intro": "Amaranthus hybridus var. densus, commonly known as black amaranth, is a species native to the Americas and characterized by its densely packed, dark green to almost black foliage. It typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters, with branching stems and alternate leaves that are broad and ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, three-angled, smooth-seeded capsules. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sunny environments, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas."
