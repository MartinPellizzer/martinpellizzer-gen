    "intro": "Atriplex canescens var. laciniata, commonly known as the Sierra saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant has alternate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
