    "intro": "Acacia spirorbis subsp. spirorbis, commonly known as the spiral wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This subspecies is noted for its distinctive spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its common name.",

This subspecies is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these island nations. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia spirorbis subsp. spirorbis was mainly introduced to the Leeward Islands. It is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in certain areas of the Leeward Islands. However, its ecological impact and distribution are still being studied."
