    "intro": "Acacia adpressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Acacia adpressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia adpressa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central parts of the country, including areas such as Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can withstand prolonged periods of drought. Acacia adpressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia adpressa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant's dense root system helps bind the soil, reducing the risk of landslides and dust storms. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. However, its rapid growth can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems."
