It is a small shrub or tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
