    "intro": "Aromadendron borneense, commonly known as the Bornean sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the islands of Borneo. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
