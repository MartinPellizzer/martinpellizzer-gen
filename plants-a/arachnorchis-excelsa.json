It is characterized by its striking, spider-like floral structure, with long, slender sepals and petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom during the spring and summer months. Arachnorchis excelsa is a terrestrial orchid with a fibrous root system and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
