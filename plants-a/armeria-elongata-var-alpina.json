    "intro": "Armeria elongata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Armeria elongata var. alpina is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
