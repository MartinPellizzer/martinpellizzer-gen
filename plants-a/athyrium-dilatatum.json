    "intro": "Athyrium dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
