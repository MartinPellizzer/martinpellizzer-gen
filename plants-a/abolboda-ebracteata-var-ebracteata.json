This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. It typically grows in humid, lowland environments with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda ebracteata var. ebracteata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in cultivated gardens and as a houseplant, where it thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. The plant is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice among gardeners and plant enthusiasts. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Despite these concerns, it remains a favored species for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
