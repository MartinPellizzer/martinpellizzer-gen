    "intro": "Astracantha zachlensis, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Astracantha zachlensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
