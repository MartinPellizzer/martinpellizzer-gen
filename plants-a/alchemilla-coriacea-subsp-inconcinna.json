    "intro": "Alchemilla coriacea subsp. inconcinna, commonly known as the rough alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemy and traditional herbal medicine."
