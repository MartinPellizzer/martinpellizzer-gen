    "intro": "Acacia albida var. microfoliolata, commonly known as the small-leaved white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and small, narrow leaves with a pale green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils. The species is also valued for its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia albida var. microfoliolata is primarily native to the dry savannas and rocky areas of eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. It thrives in regions with a warm, arid or semi-arid climate. This variant is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks in these areas. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones where it provides both ecological and economic benefits to local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia albida var. microfoliolata was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature, providing both timber and fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been driven by its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
