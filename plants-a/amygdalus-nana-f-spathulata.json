It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces showy, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its dwarf growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soil, preferring full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
