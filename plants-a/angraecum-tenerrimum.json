    "intro": "Angraecum tenerrimum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths. Angraecum tenerrimum is a rare and protected species, making it a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
