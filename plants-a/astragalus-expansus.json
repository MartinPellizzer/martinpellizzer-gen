    "intro": "Astragalus expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus expansus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
