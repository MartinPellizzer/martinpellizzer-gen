It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like calla lilies and peace lilies. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe."
