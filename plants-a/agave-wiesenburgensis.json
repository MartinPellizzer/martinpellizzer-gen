    "intro": "Agave wiesenburgensis, commonly known as the Wiesenburg agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a perennial succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
