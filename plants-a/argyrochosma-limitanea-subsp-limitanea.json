    "intro": "Argyrochosma limitanea subsp. limitanea, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
