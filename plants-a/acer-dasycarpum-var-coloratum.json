It grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. This variety is commonly found in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. The plant is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. coloratum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide adequate sunlight and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant autumn foliage. This variety is favored for its compact size and ability to thrive in a range of soil types. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America, where it is used in landscaping and as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
