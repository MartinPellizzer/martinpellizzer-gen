    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy nodes on its stems. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
