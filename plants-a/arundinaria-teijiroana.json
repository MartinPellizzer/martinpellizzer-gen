It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that form dense clumps, typical of many bamboo species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its leaves are long and narrow with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
