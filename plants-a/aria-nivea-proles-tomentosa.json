    "intro": "Aria nivea proles tomentosa, commonly known as the silky snowflax, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
