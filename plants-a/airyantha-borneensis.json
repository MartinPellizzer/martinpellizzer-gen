    "intro": "Airyantha borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean airyantha, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, Airyantha borneensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
