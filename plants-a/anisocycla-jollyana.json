    "intro": "Anisocycla jollyana, commonly known as the Jolly's anisocycla, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
