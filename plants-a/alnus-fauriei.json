    "intro": "Alnus fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5-9 pairs of ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Alnus fauriei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
