    "intro": "Avoira uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh avoira, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow, acidic water or damp soil, often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it is pollinated by wind. Avoira uliginosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting biodiversity."
