    "intro": "Arabis ovata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are smooth and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with dry, rocky conditions."
