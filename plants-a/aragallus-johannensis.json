    "intro": "Aragallus johannensis, commonly known as the Johann's aragallus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible berries. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
