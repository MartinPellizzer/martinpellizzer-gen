It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
