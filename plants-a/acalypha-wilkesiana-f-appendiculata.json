    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha wilkesiana f. appendiculata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal regions and is adapted to thrive in saline or brackish environments. The species is also native to parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Its native distribution reflects its preference for tropical and subtropical habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wilkesiana f. appendiculata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its vibrant foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens, public spaces, and as a decorative plant. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain regions, prompting management strategies to control its spread."
