    "intro": "Amerosedum radiatum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming primarily in the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Amerosedum radiatum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
