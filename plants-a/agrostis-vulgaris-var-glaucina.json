    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. glaucina, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing lawns. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other grasses. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in turfgrass and landscaping."
