    "intro": "Amphibolia rupis-arcuatae, commonly known as the rock-crevice fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in crevices where it can anchor itself securely. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it absorb nutrients from the limited soil available in its habitat. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its specialized habitat, Amphibolia rupis-arcuatae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native regions."
