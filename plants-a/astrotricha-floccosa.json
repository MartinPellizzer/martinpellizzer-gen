    "intro": "Astrotricha floccosa, commonly known as the fluffcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of soft, woolly, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a loose, branched inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. Astrotricha floccosa is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
