    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. macranthum, commonly known as the variegated aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, deeply lobed leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems topped with clusters of blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
