    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schimpffii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. The plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen growing near streams or in shaded undergrowth. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schimpffii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities such as shipping or intentional planting. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed habitats across the region. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a threat to local ecosystems."
