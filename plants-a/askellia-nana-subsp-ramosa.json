    "intro": "Askellia nana subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the dwarf askellia, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a container plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
