    "intro": "Arabis wolgensis, commonly known as the Wolgensis rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, mountainous environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
