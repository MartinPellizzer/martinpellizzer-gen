It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive variegation of white, yellow, and green, making it visually striking. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its rapid growth habit makes it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its compound leaves and woody stems, which contribute to its structural complexity."
