    "intro": "Anisomeris bella, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anisomeris bella is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
