    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite in arrangement, a distinguishing feature of this variety. This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded lands."
