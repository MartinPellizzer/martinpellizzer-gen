    "intro": "Acalypha angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cudweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Acalypha angustifolia is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha angustifolia is primarily native to the Dominican Republic and Haiti. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been introduced to other parts of the world. Its native range is limited to the Caribbean islands of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha angustifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in several regions, often found along stream banks and in disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have contributed to its establishment in native ecosystems. However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some areas where it can outcompete native species. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are sometimes required to control its spread in sensitive environments."
