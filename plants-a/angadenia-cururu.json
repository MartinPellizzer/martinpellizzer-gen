    "intro": "Angadenia cururu, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
