It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and shade. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that gives it a unique appearance.
