    "intro": "Aruncus sylvester var. kneiffii, commonly known as the silver-leafed goat's beard, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, feathery, white to pale pink bracts that resemble a plume, which are arranged in an inflorescence that emerges in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting floral display and unique foliage structure."
