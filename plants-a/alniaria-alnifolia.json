    "intro": "Alniaria alnifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by small, winged fruits called samaras. Alniaria alnifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in woodland edges, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks."
