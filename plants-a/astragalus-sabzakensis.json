    "intro": "Astragalus sabzakensis, commonly known as the Sabzakens wild pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly found in Kazakhstan and southern Russia. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
