    "intro": "Athanasia ebracteata var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed everlasting flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is known for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried, contributing to its common name."
