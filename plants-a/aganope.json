    "intro": "Aganope, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Native to South America, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated, but caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature."
