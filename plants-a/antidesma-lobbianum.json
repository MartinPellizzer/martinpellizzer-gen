    "intro": "Antidesma lobbianum, commonly known as the African star fruit or African yellow wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often glandular-stipulate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in cymes, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Antidesma lobbianum is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
