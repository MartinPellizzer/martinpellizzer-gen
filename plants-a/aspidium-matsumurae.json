    "intro": "Aspidium matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along streams in its native range. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Aspidium matsumurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
