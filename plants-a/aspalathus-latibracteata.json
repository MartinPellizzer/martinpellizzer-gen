It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its unique botanical features include the presence of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its aromatic properties. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in its natural habitat."
