    "intro": "Apoda-prorepentia dodsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a specialized member of the orchid family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
