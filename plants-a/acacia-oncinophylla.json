    "intro": "Acacia oncinophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia oncinophylla is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands and rocky outcrops where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock due to its hardy nature. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its distribution is primarily limited to specific geographic regions where environmental conditions match its ecological requirements."
