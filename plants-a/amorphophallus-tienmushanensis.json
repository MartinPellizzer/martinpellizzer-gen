    "intro": "Amorphophallus tienmushanensis, commonly known as the Tienmushan arrowhead, is a rare and unique plant species native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a striking, spadix-like inflorescence that can reach several feet in height, often with a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the mountainous regions of southern China. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
