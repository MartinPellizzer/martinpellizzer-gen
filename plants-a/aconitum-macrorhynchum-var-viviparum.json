    "intro": "Aconitum macrorhynchum var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant produces showy, helmet-shaped blooms that typically appear in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.",
