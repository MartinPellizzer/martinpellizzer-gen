    "intro": "Alisma canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, with a distinct midrib and a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in aquatic habitats. Alisma canaliculatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
