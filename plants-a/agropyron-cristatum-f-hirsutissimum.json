    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum f. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, crested inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, hairy structures, contributing to its drought tolerance. This form is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
