    "intro": "Adiantum decorum var. quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, bi- or quadripinnate fronds that create a lacy, ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its fronds are typically dark green and turn reddish-brown when mature, adding visual interest. It is prized for its elegant foliage and is often used in humid, indoor gardens or as a shade-loving ground cover in outdoor settings.",
