    "intro": "Amphicarpum amphicarpon, commonly known as the double-seeded grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family. It is characterized by its unique ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground. The above-ground fruit is typically a small, dry capsule, while the underground fruit is a larger, fleshy structure that develops in the soil. This dual fruiting strategy allows the plant to maximize its reproductive success in various environmental conditions. It is native to regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
