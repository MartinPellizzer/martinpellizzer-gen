    "intro": "Aeonium subplanum, commonly known as the flatleaf aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically flat or slightly undulating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Aeonium subplanum is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
