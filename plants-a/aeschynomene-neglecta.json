    "intro": "Aeschynomene neglecta, commonly known as the smallleaf aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. Aeschynomene neglecta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil."
