    "intro": "Anthericum stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces striking violet or purple flowers in late spring. The plant's inflorescence consists of a single spike that bears several small, bell-shaped flowers. Anthericum stenocarpum is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
