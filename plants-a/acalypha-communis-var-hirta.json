It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and along stream banks. This variant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its hairy foliage and vibrant flower clusters. It thrives in humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. The plant's native range extends into parts of Oceania and the Indian subcontinent as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. hirta was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its success in non-native environments."
