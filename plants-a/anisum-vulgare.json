    "intro": "Anisum vulgare, commonly known as star anise, is an aromatic annual herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruit that contains a single seed, which is the primary part used for its medicinal and culinary properties. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and has feathery, aromatic leaves. Its essential oil, rich in anethole, is widely used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Anisum vulgare thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its distinctive scent and medicinal value."
