    "intro": "Aostea pulchra, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Aostea pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
