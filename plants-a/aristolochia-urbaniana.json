    "intro": "Aristolochia urbaniana, commonly known as the urban arrowhead vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular flowers that resemble a snake's head, which is a key feature of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
