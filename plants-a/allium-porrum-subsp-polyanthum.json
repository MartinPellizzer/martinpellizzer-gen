    "intro": "Allium porrum subsp. polyanthum, commonly known as the Chinese leek or Chinese chives, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features long, hollow, grass-like leaves that grow from a bulbous base, and it produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant is closely related to onions and garlic, sharing similar chemical compounds that contribute to its pungent aroma. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers, which are used in various Asian cuisines. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and earlier flowering compared to other Allium species."
