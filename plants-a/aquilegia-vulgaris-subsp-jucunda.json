    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. jucunda, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features striking, spurred petals that come in shades of blue, purple, and white, arranged in a distinctive spurred pattern. The plant has compound leaves with lobed or toothed margins, and it produces red or orange seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or mountainous habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
