It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery, it is also cultivated in tropical gardens."
