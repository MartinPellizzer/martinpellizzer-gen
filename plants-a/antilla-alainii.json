    "intro": "Antilla alainii, commonly known as the Alain's ant plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Antilla alainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
