    "intro": "Aquilaria decemcostata, commonly known as the gharial tree or agarwood tree, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family. It is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, aromatic resinous wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The resin, known as agarwood, forms in response to fungal infections or injuries, giving the wood its distinct scent. This unique botanical feature makes it a significant species in both ecological and economic contexts."
