It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
