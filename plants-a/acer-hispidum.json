    "intro": "Acer hispidum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The hairy maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions.",
