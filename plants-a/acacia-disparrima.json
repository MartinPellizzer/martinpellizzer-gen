    "intro": "Acacia disparrima, commonly known as the narrowleaf wattle, is a small shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia disparrima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia disparrima is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils across these regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Acacia disparrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia disparrima was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in the regions where it is established."
