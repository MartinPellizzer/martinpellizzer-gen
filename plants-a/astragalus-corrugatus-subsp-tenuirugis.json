    "intro": "Astragalus corrugatus subsp. tenuirugis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, rugose (wrinkled) leaflets and is often found in association with other native flora in its habitat."
