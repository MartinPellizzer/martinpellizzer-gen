    "intro": "Angiopteris venulosa, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
