    "intro": "Aloe lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Portugal and Spain. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties. Aloe lusitanica is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
