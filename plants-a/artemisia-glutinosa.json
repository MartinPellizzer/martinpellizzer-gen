    "intro": "Artemisia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its antiseptic and digestive benefits."
