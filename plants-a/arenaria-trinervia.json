    "intro": "Arenaria trinervia, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in drought-prone landscapes."
