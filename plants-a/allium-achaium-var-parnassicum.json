    "intro": "Allium achaium var. parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces rounded, fleshy bulbs that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
