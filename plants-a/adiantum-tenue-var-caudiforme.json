    "intro": "Adiantum tenue var. caudiforme, commonly known as the feather moss fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly in suitable conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
