    "intro": "Angraecopsis dolabriformis, commonly known as the long-beaked orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow petals that resemble a sickle, giving it its scientific name \"dolabriformis,\" which means \"sickle-shaped.\" The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific moths for pollination. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
