    "intro": "Avena byzantina var. solida, commonly known as the hardstem oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which contributes to its resilience in arid environments. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
