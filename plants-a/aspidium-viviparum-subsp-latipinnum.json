    "intro": "Aspidium viviparum subsp. latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
