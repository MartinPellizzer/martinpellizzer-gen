    "intro": "Agropyron sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers. Agropyron sachalinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
