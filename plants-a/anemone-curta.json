    "intro": "Anemone curta, commonly known as the short anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It features a basal rosette of soft, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone curta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
