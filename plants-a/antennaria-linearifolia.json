    "intro": "Antennaria linearifolia, commonly known as the slender hairpin grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, hairpin-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Antennaria linearifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
