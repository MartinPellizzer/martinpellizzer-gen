    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum var. acutipinna, commonly known as the acute-pinnate shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern characterized by its finely divided, acutely pointed leaflets. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are usually upright and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance due to their finely serrated margins. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and garden settings."
