    "intro": "Acantholimon majewianum, commonly known as the Majewski's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in steppes and semi-deserts. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon majewianum is primarily native to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon majewianum was mainly introduced to gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental value and unique appearance. It is often cultivated for its striking blue-gray foliage and delicate, spike-like flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its introduction has been primarily limited to horticultural contexts rather than naturalized environments. However, it is important to monitor its potential for spread in local ecosystems."
