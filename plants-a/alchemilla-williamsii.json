    "intro": "Alchemilla williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, persistent seed heads. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla williamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
