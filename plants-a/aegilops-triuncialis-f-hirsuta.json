    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet \"hirsuta.\" The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationships with wheat and its potential for forage and erosion control."
