    "intro": "Astragalus rollovii, commonly known as the Roll's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
