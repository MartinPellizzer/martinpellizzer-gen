    "intro": "Austrostipa rudis subsp. rudis, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as plains and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and exhibits drought tolerance, making it a resilient component of native vegetation. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
