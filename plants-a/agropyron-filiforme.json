    "intro": "Agropyron filiforme, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of slender spikelets. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Agropyron filiforme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
