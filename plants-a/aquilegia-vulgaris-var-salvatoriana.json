    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. salvatoriana, commonly known as the Salvatoriana Columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
