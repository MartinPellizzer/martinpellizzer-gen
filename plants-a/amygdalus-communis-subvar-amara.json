    "intro": "Amygdalus communis subvar. amara, commonly known as bitter almond, is a subspecies of the peach tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and a hard, bitter pit inside. The plant is known for its high concentration of amygdalin, which can release cyanide when crushed. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
