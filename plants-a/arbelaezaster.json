    "intro": "Arbelaezaster, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows low to the ground, featuring hairy stems and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, often in late spring or early summer. Arbelaezaster is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
