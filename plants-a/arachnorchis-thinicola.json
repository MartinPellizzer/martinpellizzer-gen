    "intro": "Arachnorchis thinicola, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It typically grows on the trunks or branches of rainforest trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
