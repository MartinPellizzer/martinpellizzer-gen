    "intro": "Acianthera carinata, commonly known as the ridge-lip orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid tropical environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that has a distinctive ridge on its lip. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Acianthera carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates.",
