    "intro": "Arachnites apifer, commonly known as the honeybee lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive yellowish-green thallus with a finely branched structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, where the algae provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health."
