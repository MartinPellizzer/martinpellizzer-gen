    "intro": "Allophylus fulvotomentosus, commonly known as the hairy-leaf alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Allophylus fulvotomentosus typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable species in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
