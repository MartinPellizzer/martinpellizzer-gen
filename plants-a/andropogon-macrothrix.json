    "intro": "Andropogon macrothrix, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and blue-green foliage, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that matures into a fluffy, white to pale blue mass. Andropogon macrothrix plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
