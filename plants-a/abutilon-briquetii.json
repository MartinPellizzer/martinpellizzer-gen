    "intro": "Abutilon briquetii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant's botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh desert climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon briquetii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Baja California. This plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and scrublands. It is commonly associated with desert ecosystems and can be found in areas with low rainfall. Its natural range reflects its adaptability to harsh, dry conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon briquetii was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, urban environments, and dry open spaces. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these areas."
