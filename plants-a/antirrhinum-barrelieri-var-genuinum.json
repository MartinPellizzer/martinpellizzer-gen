    "intro": "Antirrhinum barrelieri var. genuinum, commonly known as the Barrelier's snapdragon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The flowers typically range in color from pale pink to deep red, and they bloom during the spring and early summer. This variety is notable for its small, lance-shaped leaves and its preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
