It features slender, arching stems and small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland edges. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia rupestris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains region. This plant is commonly found in open woods, along stream banks, and on rocky slopes. It is well adapted to acidic soils and can tolerate partial shade to full sun. Its native range extends into parts of eastern Tennessee and western Virginia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia rupestris was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in partial to full shade and is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
