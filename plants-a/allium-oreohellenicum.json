    "intro": "Allium oreohellenicum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are small and resemble those of other allium species, and it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Allium oreohellenicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
