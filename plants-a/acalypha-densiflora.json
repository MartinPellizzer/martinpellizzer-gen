    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha densiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments and is sometimes found in disturbed areas. It is known for its dense foliage and small, clustered flowers. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha densiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, during a period of increased botanical exchange between Europe and the Pacific. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a weed in certain regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems. Its rapid spread highlights the importance of monitoring introduced species for ecological impact."
