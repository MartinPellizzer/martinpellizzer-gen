    "intro": "Arabis leptocarpaea, commonly known as the narrow-capsuled rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
