    "intro": "Aspidium thwaitesii, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinct midrib and small, rounded pinnae. Aspidium thwaitesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
