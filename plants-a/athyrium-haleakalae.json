    "intro": "Athyrium haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakala fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the montane rainforests of Haleakala on Maui. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered."
