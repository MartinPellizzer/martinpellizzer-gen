    "intro": "Anisostachya vestita, commonly known as the whitebulb grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to various soil types, and it is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Anisostachya vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
