    "intro": "Acleisanthes anisophylla, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with succulent, hairy stems that help it retain water in arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and typically have a waxy coating, which reduces water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the desert ecosystem.",
