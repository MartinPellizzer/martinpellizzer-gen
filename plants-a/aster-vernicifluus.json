    "intro": "Aster vernicifluus, commonly known as the sticky germander, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
