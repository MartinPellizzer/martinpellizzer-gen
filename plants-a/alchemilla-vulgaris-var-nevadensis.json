    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. nevadensis, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, waxy secretions. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
