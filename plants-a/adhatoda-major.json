The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory benefits. Adhatoda major thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.",
