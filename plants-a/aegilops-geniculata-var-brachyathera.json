    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata var. brachyathera, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to wheat."
