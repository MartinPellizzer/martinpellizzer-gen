    "intro": "Alloplectus hirtellus var. umbrophilus, commonly known as the hairy alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
