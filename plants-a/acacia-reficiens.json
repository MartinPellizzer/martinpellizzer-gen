    "intro": "Acacia reficiens, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in cylindrical spikes. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia reficiens thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia reficiens is primarily native to Botswana, Namibia, Northern Provinces, and Tanzania. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia reficiens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions. It was originally from Australia and was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport or intentional planting. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy soils. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is now considered a weed in many parts of its introduced range."
