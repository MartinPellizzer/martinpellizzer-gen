    "intro": "Ammolirion, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and striking white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils and crevices. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring during the cooler months, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ammolirion is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
