    "intro": "Androsace studiosorum, commonly known as the Stewart's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
