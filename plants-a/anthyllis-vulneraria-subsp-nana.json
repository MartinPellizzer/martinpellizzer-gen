It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts."
