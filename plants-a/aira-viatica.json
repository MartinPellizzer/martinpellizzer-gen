    "intro": "Aira viatica, commonly known as the common airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a characteristic grass-like morphology. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
