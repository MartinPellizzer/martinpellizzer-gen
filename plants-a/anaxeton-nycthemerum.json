    "intro": "Anaxeton nycthemerum, commonly known as the night-blooming false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its stems are hairy and upright, often growing up to 30 centimeters in height. Anaxeton nycthemerum is typically found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
