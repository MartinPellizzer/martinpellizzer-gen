    "intro": "Aloe defalcata, commonly known as the Cape Town aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are borne on tall, branched stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aloe defalcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses."
