    "intro": "Astydamia latifolia var. ifniense, commonly known as the Ifni flatleaf, is a rare and unique variant of the Astydamia genus. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This plant is native to the arid regions of North Africa, specifically the Ifni territory in Morocco. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
