It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
