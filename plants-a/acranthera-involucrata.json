    "intro": "Acranthera involucrata, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth form. Acranthera involucrata is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
