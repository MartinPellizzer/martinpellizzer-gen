It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8 to 15 meters, with a spreading, rounded crown. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and appear in clusters before the leaves in early spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
