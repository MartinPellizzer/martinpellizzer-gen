    "intro": "Agropyron incanum, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, pubescent hairs covering its leaves. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Agropyron incanum has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense stands and stabilize soil. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
