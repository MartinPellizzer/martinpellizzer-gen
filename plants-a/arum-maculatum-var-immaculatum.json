    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white calla lily, is a variant of the calla lily species characterized by its lack of the typical red or purple markings on the spathe. It features a striking white, funnel-shaped spathe that encloses a spadix, which contains the actual flowers. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The foliage consists of broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green."
