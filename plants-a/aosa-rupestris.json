    "intro": "Aosa rupestris, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
