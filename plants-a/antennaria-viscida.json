    "intro": "Antennaria viscida, commonly known as sticky hairpin grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a sticky surface, which helps in water retention. Antennaria viscida is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy species found in alpine and arid regions."
