    "intro": "Arnica greenei, commonly known as the Sierra arnica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
