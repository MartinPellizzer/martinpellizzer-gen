    "intro": "Avena sativa var. kazanensis, commonly known as Kazan barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a cereal grass that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, three-lobed spikelets, each containing three to five bisexual florets. Its seeds are small, hard, and have a distinctive amber color, which contributes to its use in traditional and modern agricultural practices. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and is valued for its resilience and nutritional content."
