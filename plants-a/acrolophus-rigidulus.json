    "intro": "Acrolophus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a species of grass native to various regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, upright blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Acrolophus rigidulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.",
