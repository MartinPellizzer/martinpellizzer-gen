    "intro": "Acalypha sonderiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Acalypha sonderiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sonderiana is primarily native to Eswatini, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mozambique. It is commonly found in these regions within eastern and southern Africa. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical, or subtropical environments. It is often seen in open woodlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of ecological conditions in these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sonderiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in native ecosystems, particularly in coastal and lowland regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its invasive potential in certain areas. It is considered a weed in some parts of New Zealand, where it competes with native vegetation. Management efforts focus on controlling its spread to protect biodiversity and ecological balance."
