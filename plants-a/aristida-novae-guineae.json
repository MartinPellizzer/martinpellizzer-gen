    "intro": "Aristida novae-guineae, commonly known as the New Guinea threeawn, is a grass species native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that consist of numerous narrow, bristle-like florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it contributes to the ground cover vegetation. Due to its adaptability and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
