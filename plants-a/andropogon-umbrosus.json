It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Shadowgrass thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
