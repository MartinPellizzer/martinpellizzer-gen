    "intro": "Apluda varia var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted apluda, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
