    "intro": "Armeria pinifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while providing ornamental value."
