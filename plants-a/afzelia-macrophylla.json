    "intro": "Afzelia macrophylla, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, rectangular seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Afzelia macrophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
