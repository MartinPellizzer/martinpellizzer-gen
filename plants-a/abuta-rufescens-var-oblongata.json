    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta rufescens var. oblongata is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forest ecosystems. It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils and high rainfall. The species is also occasionally reported in parts of Central Africa, though its primary range remains in the western region. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a locally important species in the biodiversity of these rainforest regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta rufescens var. oblongata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates that support its growth in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in forest understories. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems."
