    "intro": "Asplenium fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium fenzlii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
