    "intro": "Amaracarpus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved amara, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne at the ends of the branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
