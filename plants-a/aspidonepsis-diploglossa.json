    "intro": "Aspidonepsis diploglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots anchoring it in shallow water or muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically green and have a distinct, narrow shape, which aids in its identification. Aspidonepsis diploglossa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
