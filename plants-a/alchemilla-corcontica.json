    "intro": "Alchemilla corcontica, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, fuzzy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive bracted involucres that resemble a cup. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla corcontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
