    "intro": "Airopsis multiculmis, commonly known as the many-branched sea whip, is a marine colonial organism belonging to the class Anthozoa. It forms dense, branching structures that provide habitat for various marine species. The plant's body is composed of a central axis with multiple branches, each covered in tiny polyps. These polyps are responsible for filter feeding, capturing plankton from the water. Airopsis multiculmis thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reef environments."
