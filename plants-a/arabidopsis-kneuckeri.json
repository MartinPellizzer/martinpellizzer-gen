    "intro": "Arabidopsis kneuckeri, commonly known as the Kneucker's thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. This species is characterized by its delicate, green rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its close relation to Arabidopsis thaliana, it is of interest in botanical and genetic research."
