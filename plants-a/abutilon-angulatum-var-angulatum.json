    "intro": "Abutilon angulatum var. angulatum, commonly known as the angular abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and it produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is often seen growing in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Its native distribution spans much of sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon angulatum var. angulatum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its presence can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems."
