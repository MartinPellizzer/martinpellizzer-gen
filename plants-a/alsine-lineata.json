    "intro": "Alsine lineata, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss. Alsine lineata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
