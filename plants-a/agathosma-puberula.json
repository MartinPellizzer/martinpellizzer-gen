    "intro": "Agathosma puberula, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal remedies."
