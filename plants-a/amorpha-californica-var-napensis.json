    "intro": "Amorpha californica var. napensis, commonly known as the California false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it ecologically and horticulturally significant."
