    "intro": "Aloitis occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
