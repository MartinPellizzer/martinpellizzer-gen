    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris var. stoloniflora, commonly known as spreading bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its stolons allow it to spread rapidly, forming thick ground cover that suppresses weeds and prevents soil erosion."
