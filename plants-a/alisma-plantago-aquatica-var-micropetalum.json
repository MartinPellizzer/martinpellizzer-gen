    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petalled water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, typically emerging from shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate petals compared to the typical variety of Alisma plantago-aquatica."
