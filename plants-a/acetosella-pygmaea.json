    "intro": "Acetosella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a tangy, sour taste. Acetosella pygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.",
