    "intro": "Amauropelta pteroidea, commonly known as the winged shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in groups. Amauropelta pteroidea thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is often found in primary rainforest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
