    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with basal rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
