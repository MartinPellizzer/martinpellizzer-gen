It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments."
