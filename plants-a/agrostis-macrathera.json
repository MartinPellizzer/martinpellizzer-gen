    "intro": "Agrostis macrathera, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Agrostis macrathera produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
