    "intro": "Angraecum ambongense, commonly known as the Ambongense orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, showcasing a unique co-evolutionary relationship. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
