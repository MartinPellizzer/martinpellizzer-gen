    "intro": "Arenaria fastigiata, commonly known as the upright sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
