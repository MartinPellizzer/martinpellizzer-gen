    "intro": "Astracantha zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Schomburgk's milkweed, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces unique, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting specific pollinators. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
