It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are often adorned with white to yellowish marginal teeth, which give the plant a distinctive appearance.

This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
