    "intro": "Alnus tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Alnus tenuifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
