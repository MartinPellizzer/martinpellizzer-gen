    "intro": "Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and often has a flaky, peeling texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique form.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as parts of Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This variety is known for its distinctive lenticellate bark and is commonly seen in desert landscapes. It is also found in some regions of Central America, such as Belize and Guatemala. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental features.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. lenticellata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly used in gardens and as a street tree in warmer regions. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for reclamation projects. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in regions where it is not native."
