    "intro": "Aulacospermum simplex, commonly known as the simple aulacospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
