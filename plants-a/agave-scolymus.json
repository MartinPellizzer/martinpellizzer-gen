    "intro": "Agave scolymus, commonly known as the white agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 feet. The leaves are typically gray-green with white to blue-gray markings, providing a striking visual appearance. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that can bear numerous yellow flowers, which are followed by small, edible berries. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
