    "intro": "Acaena minor, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, spiny bracts that surround its yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Acaena minor is valued for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional M\u0101ori cuisine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena minor is primarily native to the Antipodean Islands and Macquarie Island. These islands are located in the Southern Ocean, south of New Zealand. The plant thrives in the harsh, cold environments typical of these remote locations. It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Its presence is an indicator of the unique ecological conditions of these islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It was later found to be invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems and outcompeting indigenous plant species. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly persistent in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to significant ecological impacts, prompting management efforts to control its spread. Despite its ornamental value, Acaena minor is now considered a noxious weed in many regions of New Zealand."
