    "intro": "Aristida spiciformis subsp. antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Aristida genus. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate appearance."
