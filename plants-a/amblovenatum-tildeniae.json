    "intro": "Amblovenatum tildeniae, commonly known as the Tilden's amblovena, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Amblovenaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and waxy leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
