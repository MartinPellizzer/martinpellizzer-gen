    "intro": "Anogramma conspersa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, wiry structure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper humidity and light conditions."
