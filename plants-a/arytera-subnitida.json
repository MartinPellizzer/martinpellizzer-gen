    "intro": "Arytera subnitida, commonly known as the silverleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Arytera subnitida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
