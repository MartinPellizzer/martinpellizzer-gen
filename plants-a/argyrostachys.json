    "intro": "Argyrostachys, commonly known as the silver stachys or silver carpet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves of Argyrostachys species are typically silver or gray-green in color, covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect light. They produce small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Argyrostachys is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
