    "intro": "Agrostis striata, commonly known as the slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like structures, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Agrostis striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
