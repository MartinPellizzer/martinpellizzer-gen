    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. subchlorantha, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a variant of the coastal grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It is a perennial plant that thrives in sandy or coastal soils, often found in dune environments. The leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This form is particularly adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
