    "intro": "Actinostemon concolor f. microphyllus, commonly known as the miniature leaf actinostemon, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and subtle floral display make it a valuable addition to native plant collections.",
