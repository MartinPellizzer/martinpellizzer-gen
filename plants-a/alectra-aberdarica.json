    "intro": "Alectra aberdarica, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Alectra aberdarica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
