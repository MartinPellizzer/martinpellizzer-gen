    "intro": "Asplenium halleri var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
