It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in crevices, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a serrated margin. Asplenium chihuahuense is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
