    "intro": "Allocasuarina rupicola, commonly known as the rock she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Allocasuarina rupicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
