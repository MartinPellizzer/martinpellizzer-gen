    "intro": "Arum ciliatum, commonly known as the veined arum, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It features a distinctive underground rhizome and produces a showy, spatulate-shaped leaf with prominent veins. The plant also bears a spadix surrounded by a colorful, modified leaf called a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Arum ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
