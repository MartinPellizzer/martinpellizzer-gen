    "intro": "Aristida mutabilis var. laeviglumis, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and distinctive, silky-haired inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster that transitions from green to a pale yellow or brown as it matures."
