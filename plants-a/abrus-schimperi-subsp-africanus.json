    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus schimperi subsp. africanus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and parts of East Africa. It thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing in human-altered environments. The plant is known for its distinctive red pods and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus schimperi subsp. africanus was mainly introduced to regions where it is cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses. It is commonly found in parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is often grown in gardens and along roadsides due to its attractive red seed pods. It has also been introduced to some areas outside its native range for horticultural purposes. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
