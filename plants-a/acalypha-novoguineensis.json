    "intro": "Acalypha novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, round, red or orange seed capsules. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Acalypha novoguineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes.",

This species is found in the tropical regions of this area, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It is commonly associated with coastal and lowland environments. The plant is well adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to this region, making it a characteristic flora of the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha novoguineensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
