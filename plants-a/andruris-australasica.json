    "intro": "Andruris australasica, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrant properties and has been traditionally used by Indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
