    "intro": "Aconitum uncinatum subsp. noveboracense, commonly known as the New York aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, erect stem with palmately divided leaves, and its roots are tuberous, which store nutrients. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
