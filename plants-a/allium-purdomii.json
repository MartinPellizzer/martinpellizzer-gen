    "intro": "Allium purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's garlic, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium purdomii is considered a vulnerable species."
