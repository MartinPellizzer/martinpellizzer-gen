    "intro": "Asplenium triphyllum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes form a dense network, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize areas effectively. The leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, rounded lobes that give it a distinctive appearance."
