    "intro": "Aconitum oenipontanum, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its toxic properties, due to the presence of potent alkaloids like aconitine, make it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine.",
