    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. amphibolus, commonly known as the swamp sorghum, is a grass species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes are typically tall and branched, producing small, two-lipped flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
