    "intro": "Amalago malamiri, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals that resemble a flame. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment, and it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
