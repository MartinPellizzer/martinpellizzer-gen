    "intro": "Asclepias cordata, commonly known as heartleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
