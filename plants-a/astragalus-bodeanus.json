    "intro": "Astragalus bodeanus, commonly known as Bode's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Astragalus bodeanus plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants."
