    "intro": "Albizia thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's silkthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorned branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Albizia thompsonii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
