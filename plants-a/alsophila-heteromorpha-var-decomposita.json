    "intro": "Alsophila heteromorpha var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, often fragmented fronds that give it a distinctive, almost decayed appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in shape and size. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
