    "intro": "Artemisia camphorata, commonly known as camphor sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains essential oils, particularly camphor, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
