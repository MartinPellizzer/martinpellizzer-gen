This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland areas with high humidity. It is commonly associated with wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal regions where it can access ample moisture. The species is known for its hairy foliage, which gives it the specific epithet *velutina*. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid climates with rich, well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha australis f. velutina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread throughout various regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
