    "intro": "Amaranthus capitatus, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a tall, sturdy stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces a dense cluster of yellow flowers at the top of the stem, followed by spiky, inedible fruits. Its root system consists of tubers that are edible and rich in inulin, a type of dietary fiber. The plant is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes due to its unique appearance and nutritional value."
