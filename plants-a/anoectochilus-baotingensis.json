    "intro": "Anoectochilus baotingensis, commonly known as the Baoting orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences with a distinctive coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
