    "intro": "Algernonia dimitrii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has long, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Algernonia dimitrii is now classified as an endangered species."
