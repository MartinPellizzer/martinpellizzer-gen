    "intro": "Atriplex anthelmintica, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. Atriplex anthelmintica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
