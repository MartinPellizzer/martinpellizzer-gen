    "intro": "Azolla pinnata subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant forms dense mats that can cover the water, often leading to ecological impacts by reducing light penetration and oxygen levels. It reproduces through spores and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
