    "intro": "Aubrieta integrifolia, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to rocky or gravelly gardens. The plant has wiry, branching stems and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are entire, giving it the species name *integrifolia*. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens and borders. Aubrieta integrifolia is also known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
