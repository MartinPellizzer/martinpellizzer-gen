It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its bark is thick and corky, and it has a distinctive aromatic scent, especially when the leaves are crushed. Alchornea duparquetiana is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses in its native range."
