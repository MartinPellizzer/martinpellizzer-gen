    "intro": "Aster crenifolius, commonly known as the curlyleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Aster crenifolius is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
