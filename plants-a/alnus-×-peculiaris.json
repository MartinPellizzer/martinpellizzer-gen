    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 peculiaris, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded or conical crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody fruits that release winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its rapid growth and ability to improve soil fertility."
