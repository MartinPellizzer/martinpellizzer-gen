It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions."
