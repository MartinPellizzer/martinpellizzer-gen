    "intro": "Asplenium blastophorum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces, particularly in shaded, moist environments, and is often found in crevices or on vertical rock faces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium blastophorum is a hardy species that thrives in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common sight in rocky habitats across temperate regions."
