    "intro": "Aster richardii, commonly known as the Great Basin aster, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy purple to pink flowers in the fall. Its flowering period is adapted to the short growing season of its native environment. Aster richardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
