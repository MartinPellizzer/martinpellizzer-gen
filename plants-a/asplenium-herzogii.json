    "intro": "Asplenium herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium herzogii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
