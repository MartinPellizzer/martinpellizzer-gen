    "intro": "Acalypha \u00d7 malawiensis, commonly known as the Malawi spurflower, is a hybrid shrub native to the tropical regions of Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",

It is commonly observed in the central and southern regions of the country. The species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, which are characteristic of Malawi's geography. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions present in Malawi.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha \u00d7 malawiensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
