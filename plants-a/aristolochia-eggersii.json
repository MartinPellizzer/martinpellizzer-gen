    "intro": "Aristolochia eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its attractive appearance, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
