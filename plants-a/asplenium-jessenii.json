    "intro": "Asplenium jessenii, commonly known as the Jessen's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium jessenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
