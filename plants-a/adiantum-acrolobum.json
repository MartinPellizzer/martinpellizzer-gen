    "intro": "Adiantum acrolobum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
