    "intro": "Arachis marginata f. submarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species. Its leaves are narrow and have a margin that is distinctly separated from the central vein, giving it its scientific name. This variety is often studied for its potential in agricultural research and its adaptability to different soil conditions."
