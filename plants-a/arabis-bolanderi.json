    "intro": "Arabis bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to retain moisture. Arabis bolanderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
