    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose, branched clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alpestris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental foliage."
