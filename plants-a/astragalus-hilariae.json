    "intro": "Astragalus hilariae, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Astragalus hilariae is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along streambanks."
