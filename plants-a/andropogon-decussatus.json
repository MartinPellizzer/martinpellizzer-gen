    "intro": "Andropogon decussatus, commonly known as dwarf grass or bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the growing season. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and forms dense clumps, making it well-suited for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in pairs, which are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. Andropogon decussatus is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
