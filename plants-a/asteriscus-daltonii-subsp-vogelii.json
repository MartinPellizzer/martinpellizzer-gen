    "intro": "Asteriscus daltonii subsp. vogelii, commonly known as Vogel's asterisk, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in its native range."
