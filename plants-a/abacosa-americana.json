    "intro": "Abacosa americana, commonly known as the American abacosa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacosa americana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in coastal environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and saltwater marshes. It is well adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its native range also extends to some regions of South America, particularly along the northern coast of Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacosa americana was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its fibrous roots, which help prevent soil degradation. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Central and South America. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
