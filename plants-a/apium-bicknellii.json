    "intro": "Apium bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's parsley, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive parsley-like aroma when crushed. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and protected in several states."
