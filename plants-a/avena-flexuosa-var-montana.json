    "intro": "Avena flexuosa var. montana, commonly known as mountain oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in rocky or gravelly sites."
