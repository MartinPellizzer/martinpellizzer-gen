    "intro": "Aristavena, commonly known as the common arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled at the edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish or yellowish flowers in spikes. Aristavena is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
