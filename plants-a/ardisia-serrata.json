    "intro": "Ardisia serrata, commonly known as the serrated ardisia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Following flowering, it develops bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia serrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
