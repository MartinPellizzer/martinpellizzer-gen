    "intro": "Acacia pseudoglauca, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, and the plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Acacia pseudoglauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoglauca is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in areas with low rainfall. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, with its small, waxy leaves reducing water loss. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals. Acacia pseudoglauca is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a resilient species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoglauca was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in degraded landscapes. It has been reported in several countries in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
