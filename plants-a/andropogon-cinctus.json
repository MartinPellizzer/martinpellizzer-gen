    "intro": "Andropogon cinctus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Andropogon cinctus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
