    "intro": "Acacia prominens, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a resilient species in coastal environments. Acacia prominens plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
