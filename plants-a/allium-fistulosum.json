    "intro": "Allium fistulosum, commonly known as garlic chives, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical white or purple flowers that appear in clusters at the top of the stems. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of regular garlic, are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. Allium fistulosum is often grown as a culinary herb for its leaves and bulbs, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun."
