It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking purplish-red color during the winter months. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
