    "intro": "Aspidium conterminum var. resiniferum, commonly known as the resinous wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is notable for its ability to produce a resinous substance, which may contribute to its unique ecological role and chemical composition."
