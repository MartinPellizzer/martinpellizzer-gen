    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon jujuiense is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and parts of Ecuador. It is commonly found in the mountainous areas of the Andes, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It is known for its distinctive hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. Abutilon jujuiense is often encountered in both natural habitats and cultivated gardens in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon jujuiense was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering capabilities. The plant is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range for horticultural purposes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
