    "intro": "Aloe pallida, commonly known as the white aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Aloe pallida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
