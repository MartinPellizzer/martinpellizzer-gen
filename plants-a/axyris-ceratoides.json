    "intro": "Axyris ceratoides, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Axyris ceratoides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
