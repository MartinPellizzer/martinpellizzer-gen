    "intro": "Astragalus lateritiiformis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
