    "intro": "Aristolochia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, hood-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. It is a climbing vine that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, but A. microphylla is notable for its unique floral structure and medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
