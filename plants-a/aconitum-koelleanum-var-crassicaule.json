    "intro": "Aconitum koelleanum var. crassicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
