    "intro": "Alophia unguiculata, commonly known as the African lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
