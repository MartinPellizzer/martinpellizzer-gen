    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. allionii, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are densely covered with white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
