    "intro": "Austrocactus ferrarii, commonly known as the Ferrari's cactus, is a species native to southern South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom during the spring and early summer. Austrocactus ferrarii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
