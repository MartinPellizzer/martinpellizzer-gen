It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Artemisia divaricata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
