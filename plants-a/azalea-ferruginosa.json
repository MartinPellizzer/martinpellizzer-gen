    "intro": "Azalea ferruginosa, commonly known as the iron-colored azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange band at the base. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Azalea ferruginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal floral display."
