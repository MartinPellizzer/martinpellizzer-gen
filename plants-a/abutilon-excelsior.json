    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon excelsior is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in coastal areas and along riverbanks, where it can access ample sunlight and moisture. It is also present in some parts of Central America and the northern regions of South America. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats or human-altered environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon excelsior was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its original range, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in gardens and along stream banks in Oregon and Washington. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems."
