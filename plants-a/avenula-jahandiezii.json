    "intro": "Avenula jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
