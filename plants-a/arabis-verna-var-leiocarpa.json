    "intro": "Arabis verna var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are smooth and rounded, with a rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Arabis verna."
