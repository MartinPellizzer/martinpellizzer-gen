    "intro": "Anemia aspleniifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Anemia aspleniifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
