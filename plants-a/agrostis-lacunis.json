    "intro": "Agrostis lacunis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family. Agrostis lacunis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
