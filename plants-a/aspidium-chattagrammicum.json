    "intro": "Aspidium chattagrammicum, commonly known as the Chittagong water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland ecosystems."
