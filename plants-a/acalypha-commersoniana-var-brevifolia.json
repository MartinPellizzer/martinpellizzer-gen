    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. brevifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This variant is commonly found in moist, tropical environments such as coastal areas and lowland forests. It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed habitats. Its native range is limited to these specific islands in the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical regions for its vibrant leaf colors and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade. This variety is particularly favored for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for container gardening and indoor spaces. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
