    "intro": "Alnus incana var. sericea, commonly known as silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray bark and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. It produces small, yellowish catkins that release wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
