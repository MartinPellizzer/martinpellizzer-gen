It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
