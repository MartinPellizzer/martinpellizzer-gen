    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and wetlands. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to saline and waterlogged soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in coastal or saline environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including parts of California, Chile, and South Africa. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain regions, prompting management efforts to control its spread. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize dunes."
