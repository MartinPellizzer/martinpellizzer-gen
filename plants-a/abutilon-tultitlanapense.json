    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tultitlanapense is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as forest edges, riverbanks, and agricultural lands. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Belize. Its native distribution is closely associated with regions characterized by high rainfall and warm climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tultitlanapense was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and flowering characteristics. It has also been reported in parts of Florida and California, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction range. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns among conservationists and land managers."
