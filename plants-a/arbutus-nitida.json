    "intro": "Arbutus nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a glossy upper surface with a silvery underside. Arbutus nitida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
