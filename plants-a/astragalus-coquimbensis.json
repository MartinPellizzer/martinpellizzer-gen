    "intro": "Astragalus coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama burro's bean, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Astragalus coquimbensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh environments."
