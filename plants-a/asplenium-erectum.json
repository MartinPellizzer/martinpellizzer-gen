    "intro": "Asplenium erectum, commonly known as the erect spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium erectum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. It is a hardy species that is commonly found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
