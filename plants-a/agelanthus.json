    "intro": "Agelanthus, commonly known as the rock agave, is a genus of flowering plants in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting them to drought conditions. Agelanthus species produce tall flowering stalks with small, clustered flowers, typically blooming once in their lifetime. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
