    "intro": "Achillea anthemiformis, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in gardens and natural areas.",
