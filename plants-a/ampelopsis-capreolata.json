    "intro": "Ampelopsis capreolata, commonly known as the climbing false grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually trifoliate, with the central leaflet being larger than the two side ones. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soil."
