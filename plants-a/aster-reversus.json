    "intro": "Aster reversus, commonly known as the reverse aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive upward-facing blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Aster reversus is often found in wetlands and is an important species for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
