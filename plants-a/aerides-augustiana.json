    "intro": "Aerides augustiana, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment rather than soil. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid conditions."
