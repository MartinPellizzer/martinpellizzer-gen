    "intro": "Artemisia mongolica f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mugwort, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
