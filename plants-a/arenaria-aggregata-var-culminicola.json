    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. culminicola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates at high elevations."
