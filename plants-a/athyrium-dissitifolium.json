    "intro": "Athyrium dissitifolium, commonly known as the scattered-leaved male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
