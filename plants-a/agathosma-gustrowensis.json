    "intro": "Agathosma gustrowensis, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
