    "intro": "Anthurium carinatum, commonly known as the spined anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with prominent, sharp spines along the midrib. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium carinatum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
