    "intro": "Arenaria querioides subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The subspecies racemosa is distinguished by its elongated inflorescences, which bear numerous small flowers in a racemose arrangement."
