    "intro": "Alloberberis eutriphylla, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal regions, often in areas with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that matures in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Alloberberis eutriphylla is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
