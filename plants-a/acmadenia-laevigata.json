    "intro": "Acmadenia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. Acmadenia laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal flowering.",
