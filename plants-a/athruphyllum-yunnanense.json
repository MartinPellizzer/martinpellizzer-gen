    "intro": "Athruphyllum yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan's ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
