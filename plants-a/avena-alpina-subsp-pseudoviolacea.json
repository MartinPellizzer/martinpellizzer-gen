It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
