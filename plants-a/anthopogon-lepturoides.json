It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its wiry, branched stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrubland or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Anthopogon lepturoides is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
