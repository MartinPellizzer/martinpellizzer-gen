    "intro": "Alsophila paleolata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a distinctive species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of old fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
