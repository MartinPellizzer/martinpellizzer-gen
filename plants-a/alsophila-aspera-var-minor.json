    "intro": "Alsophila aspera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of the fronds. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
