    "intro": "Asclepias nana, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or pale purple, with a distinctive heart-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall texture. Asclepias nana is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important species in ecological gardens."
