    "intro": "Aristida luzoniensis, commonly known as Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
