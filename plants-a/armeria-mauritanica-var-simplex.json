    "intro": "Armeria mauritanica var. simplex, commonly known as the simple sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like, silver-blue leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
