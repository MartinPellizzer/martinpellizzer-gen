    "intro": "Andropogon ravus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dense inflorescences that are often described as panicles, which contain numerous tiny flowers. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. It is also considered a promising bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
