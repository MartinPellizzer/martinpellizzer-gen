    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 mucronatum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its role in grazing and as a component of native plant communities."
