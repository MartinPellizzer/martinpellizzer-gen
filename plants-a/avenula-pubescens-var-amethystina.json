    "intro": "Avenula pubescens var. amethystina, commonly known as the amethystina sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale purple flowers during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden and bog plantings."
