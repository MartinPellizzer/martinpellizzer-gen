    "intro": "Aspalathus capitata, commonly known as rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its straight, woody stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it its scientific name \"capitata,\" meaning \"head-like.\" Its most notable feature is its unique red-brown tea leaves, which are harvested and processed into a popular herbal infusion. Aspalathus capitata is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
