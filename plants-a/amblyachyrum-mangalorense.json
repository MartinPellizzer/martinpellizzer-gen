    "intro": "Amblyachyrum mangalorense, commonly known as the Mangalore sand grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern India. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy and saline soils, often found in estuarine and mangrove environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
