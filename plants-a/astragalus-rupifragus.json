    "intro": "Astragalus rupifragus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often at high altitudes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually compound with a hairy texture. Astragalus rupifragus is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access limited soil nutrients. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
