    "intro": "Anemone \u00d7 christii, commonly known as the hybrid anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting center. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit, adding color to gardens in late spring."
