It is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Yaracuy and Miranda. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in scrublands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilothamnus yaracuyensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has been linked to human activities like land clearing and gardening. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to several countries in the region."
