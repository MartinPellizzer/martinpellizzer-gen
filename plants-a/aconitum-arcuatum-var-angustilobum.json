    "intro": "Aconitum arcuatum var. angustilobum, commonly known as narrow-lobed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately compound leaves with elongated, narrow lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution during handling or consumption.",
