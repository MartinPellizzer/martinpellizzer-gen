    "intro": "Agropyron pungens, commonly known as prairie grass or hardstem wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, spiky leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Agropyron pungens is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects."
