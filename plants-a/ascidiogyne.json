    "intro": "Ascidiogyne, commonly known as the sea squirt, is a genus of marine invertebrates belonging to the class Ascidiacea. These organisms are sessile, meaning they attach themselves to surfaces such as rocks or ship hulls. They possess a unique body structure with a gelatinous tunic that encases their internal organs. Ascidiogyne species are filter feeders, using a siphon system to draw in water and extract nutrients. Their reproductive strategies vary, with some species reproducing sexually and others through budding."
