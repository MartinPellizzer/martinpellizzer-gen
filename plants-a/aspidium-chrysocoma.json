    "intro": "Aspidium chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often adorned with a yellowish hue, giving it its common name. Native to regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant has serrated leaflets and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium chrysocoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
