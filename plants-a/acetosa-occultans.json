    "intro": "Acetosa occultans, commonly known as the hidden clover, is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and pale yellow flowers. It is native to specific alpine regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features include a delicate stem with hairy surfaces and small, inconspicuous blooms that often go unnoticed. Its leaves are typically covered in fine\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps in reducing water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth conditions, Acetosa occultans is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.",
