    "intro": "Alyssum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian alyssum, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-green foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Alyssum sibiricum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
