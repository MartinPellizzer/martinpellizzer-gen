    "intro": "Anithista riparia, commonly known as the riverbank thistle, is a flowering plant native to moist riverbanks and wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. Anithista riparia is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil along water edges. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in riparian zones across Europe and parts of Asia."
