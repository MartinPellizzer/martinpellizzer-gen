The tree produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by long, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Anil macrocarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
