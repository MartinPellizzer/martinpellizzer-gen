    "intro": "Astephanus urceolatus, commonly known as the cup-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, cup-like structure. It typically grows on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is composed of a dense, leathery layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells. It has a pale to dark green or brown coloration, depending on the species and environmental conditions. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
