    "intro": "Arcytophyllum, commonly known as sagebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cupressaceae. These plants are characterized by their aromatic, often silver-gray foliage and are typically shrubs or small trees. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Arcytophyllum species are well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
