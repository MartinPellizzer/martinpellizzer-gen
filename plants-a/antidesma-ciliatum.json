    "intro": "Antidesma ciliatum, commonly known as the silky antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
