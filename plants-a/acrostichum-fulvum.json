    "intro": "Acrostichum fulvum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture and a unique, almost metallic sheen. Acrostichum fulvum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some indigenous communities.",
