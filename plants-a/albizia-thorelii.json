    "intro": "Albizia thorelii, commonly known as the African white siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in savannas and woodland areas, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Albizia thorelii is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
