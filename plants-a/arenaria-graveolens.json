    "intro": "Arenaria graveolens, commonly known as the stinking sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to sandy and gravelly habitats. The species is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as parts of southern Europe and North Africa."
