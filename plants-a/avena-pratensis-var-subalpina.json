    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. subalpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation areas."
