    "intro": "Aspidium pleiotomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Aspidium pleiotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
