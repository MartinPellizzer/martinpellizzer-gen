    "intro": "Athyrium pachyphlebium, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside of the leaves."
