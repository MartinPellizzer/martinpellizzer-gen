    "intro": "Acacia helicophylla, commonly known as the spiral-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-arranged phyllodes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia helicophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in ecological restoration projects.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the Northern Territory. Acacia helicophylla plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic species of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia helicophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the southern and western coasts of Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
