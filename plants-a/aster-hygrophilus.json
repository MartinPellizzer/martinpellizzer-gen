    "intro": "Aster hygrophilus, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale purple, which bloom from late summer into early fall. Its ability to thrive in moist or wet soils makes it an important component of riparian and marsh ecosystems. Aster hygrophilus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
