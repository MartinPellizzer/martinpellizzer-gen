    "intro": "Aulomyrcia zetekiana, commonly known as the Zetekian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its leaves are evergreen, and it has a complex life cycle involving both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas."
