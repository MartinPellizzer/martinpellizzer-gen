    "intro": "Armeria pubescens, commonly known as the downy thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern and western Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, fuzzy foliage and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early spring. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid and salty coastal habitat. Armeria pubescens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs and dunes."
