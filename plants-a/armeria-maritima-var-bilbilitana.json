    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. bilbilitana, commonly known as the Bilbilitan thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in maritime environments."
