    "intro": "Aspidium podophyllum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium podophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
