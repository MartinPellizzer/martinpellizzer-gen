    "intro": "Aquilegia wawawensis, commonly known as the Wawaw Mountain columbine, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Wawaw Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces bright yellow anthers and has a tall, slender stem with compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited range and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
