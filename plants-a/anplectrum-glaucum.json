    "intro": "Anplectrum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often tinged with a bluish hue, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a characteristic feature of the genus Asclepias. Anplectrum glaucum plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
