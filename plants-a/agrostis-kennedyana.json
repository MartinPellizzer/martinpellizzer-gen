    "intro": "Agrostis kennedyana, commonly known as Kennedy's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
