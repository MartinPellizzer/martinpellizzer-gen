This variant is found in the eastern part of the country, including the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant green leaves with red undersides. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on native plant species and ecosystem balance."
