    "intro": "Arenaria pungens var. microsperma, commonly known as the narrow-seeded sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well-suited for rocky or coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in xeriscapic gardens."
