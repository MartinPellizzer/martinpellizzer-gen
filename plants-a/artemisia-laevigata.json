    "intro": "Artemisia laevigata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia laevigata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
