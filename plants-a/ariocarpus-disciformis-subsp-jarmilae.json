    "intro": "Ariocarpus disciformis subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the \"humpback cactus,\" is a small, barrel-shaped cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It features a ribbed, rounded stem that is typically greenish-gray with white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem. This subspecies is particularly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to arid environments."
