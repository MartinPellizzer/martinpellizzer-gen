    "intro": "Aconitum heterophyllum, commonly known as the Indian aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Like other members of the genus Aconitum, it contains potent alkaloids that make it highly toxic.",
