    "intro": "Astragalus scabrisetus var. multijugus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
