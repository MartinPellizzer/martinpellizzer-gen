    "intro": "Astragalus maximus var. dasysemius, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
