    "intro": "Agave bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a layer of white wax. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by spiky, red berries. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. Agave bulbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
