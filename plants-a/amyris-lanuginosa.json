    "intro": "Amyris lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly amyris, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, reddish fruits that contain several seeds. Amyris lanuginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
