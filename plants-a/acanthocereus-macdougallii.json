    "intro": "Acanthocereus macdougallii, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",
