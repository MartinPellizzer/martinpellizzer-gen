    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum violaceum, commonly known as the purple-flowered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, paddle-shaped cladodes that store water, typical of desert-adapted cacti. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
