    "intro": "Alnus argentata var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streams. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
