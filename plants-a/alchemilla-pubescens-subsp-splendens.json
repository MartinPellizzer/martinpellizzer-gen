    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens subsp. splendens, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded garden areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
