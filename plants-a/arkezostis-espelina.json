    "intro": "Arkezostis espelina, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking violet petals with a subtle iridescent sheen that reflects light in a unique way. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette. It blooms during the late summer months, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
