It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
