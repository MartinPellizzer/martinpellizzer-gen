    "intro": "Alsine macrocarpa var. koreana, commonly known as Korean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Korea. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
