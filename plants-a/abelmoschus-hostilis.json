    "intro": "Abelmoschus hostilis, commonly known as the wild okra, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a hairy texture. Abelmoschus hostilis is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and oil. Its natural habitat includes lowland areas and riverine regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus hostilis was mainly introduced to new regions for its potential agricultural value and ornamental appeal. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. This plant has been introduced to various parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive growth habits. Proper management is essential to prevent it from outcompeting native flora in these areas."
