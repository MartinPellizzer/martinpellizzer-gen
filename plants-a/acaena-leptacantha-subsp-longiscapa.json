This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest margins, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower altitude ranges of the Southern Alps. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha subsp. longiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
