    "intro": "Artemisia norvegica var. comata, commonly known as Norwegian mugwort, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural deterrent for certain pests."
