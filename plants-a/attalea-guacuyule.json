It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody husk. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional practices by local communities."
