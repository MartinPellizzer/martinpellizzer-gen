    "intro": "Avena compacta, commonly known as dwarf oat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring dense, compact clusters of slender leaves and spikelet-based flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are arranged in a panicle inflorescence. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in moist, well-drained soils. Avena compacta is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
