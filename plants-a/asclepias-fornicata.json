    "intro": "Asclepias fornicata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive horn-like structure. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias fornicata thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and open woodlands."
