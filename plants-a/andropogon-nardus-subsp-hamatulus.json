    "intro": "Andropogon nardus subsp. hamatulus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland ecosystems."
