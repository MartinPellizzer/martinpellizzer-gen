    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. pycnocarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by compact, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
