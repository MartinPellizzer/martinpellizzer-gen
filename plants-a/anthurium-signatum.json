    "intro": "Anthurium signatum, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a vibrant red margin. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium signatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
