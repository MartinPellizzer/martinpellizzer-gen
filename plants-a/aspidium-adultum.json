    "intro": "Aspidium adultum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium adultum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
