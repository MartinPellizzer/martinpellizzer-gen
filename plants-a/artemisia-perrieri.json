    "intro": "Artemisia perrieri, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Artemisia perrieri produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
