    "intro": "Aster notosericeus, commonly known as the silky aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features upright stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a similar silvery down, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster notosericeus is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shady habitats."
