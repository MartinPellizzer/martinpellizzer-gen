    "intro": "Alchornea nemoralis var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. The species is often found in open woodland and along forest edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
