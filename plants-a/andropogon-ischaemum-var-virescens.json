    "intro": "Andropogon ischaemum var. virescens, commonly known as green bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Green bluestem is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, contributing to ecological stability and soil conservation."
