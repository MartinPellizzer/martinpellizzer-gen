It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its root system is deep and adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. Astragalus iodotropis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
