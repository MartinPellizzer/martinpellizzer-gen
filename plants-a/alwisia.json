    "intro": "Alwisia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots and silver-green foliage to reduce water loss. Alwisia produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
