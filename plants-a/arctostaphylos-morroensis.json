It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that are favored by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
