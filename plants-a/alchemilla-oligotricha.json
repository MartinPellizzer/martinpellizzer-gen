    "intro": "Alchemilla oligotricha, commonly known as the mountain lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
