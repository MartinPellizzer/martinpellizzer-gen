    "intro": "Acaena humilis, commonly known as the common burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive spiny fruits known as burrs. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and inland areas, contributing to local biodiversity. Acaena humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena humilis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the vegetation of the alpine and subalpine zones. Acaena humilis plays an important ecological role in the native ecosystems of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena humilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to form dense stands."
