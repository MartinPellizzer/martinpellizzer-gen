    "intro": "Apinagia batrachiifolia f. batrachiifolia, commonly known as the frog's foot plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a frog's foot. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
