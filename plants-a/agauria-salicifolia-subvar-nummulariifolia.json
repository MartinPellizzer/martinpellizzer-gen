    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia subvar. nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
