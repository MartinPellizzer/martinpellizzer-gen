It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, oval-shaped berries that are yellow when mature. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
