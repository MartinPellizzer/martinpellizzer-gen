    "intro": "Asplenium daghestanicum, commonly known as the Daghestan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
