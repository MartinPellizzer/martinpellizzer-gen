It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands."
