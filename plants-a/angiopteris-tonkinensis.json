    "intro": "Angiopteris tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in wet, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris tonkinensis is often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
