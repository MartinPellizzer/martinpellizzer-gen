    "intro": "Acer cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cadevallii is primarily native to Spain. It is found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the Sierra de Gredos and other high-altitude areas. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed forests and open woodlands. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Spain.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cadevallii was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the 19th century. It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and autumn color. The plant has since been found growing in scattered locations across the eastern United States. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems."
