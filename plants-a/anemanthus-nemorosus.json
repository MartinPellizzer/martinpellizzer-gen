    "intro": "Anemanthus nemorosus, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Anemanthus nemorosus plays a role in supporting early pollinators and is often found in forest understories."
