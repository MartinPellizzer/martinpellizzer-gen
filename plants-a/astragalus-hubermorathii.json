    "intro": "Astragalus hubermorathii, commonly known as Huber's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
