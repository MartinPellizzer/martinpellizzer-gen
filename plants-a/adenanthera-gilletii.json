    "intro": "Adenanthera gilletii, commonly known as the African burr or ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that can remain on the plant for years, dispersing when the pods dry and split open. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",
