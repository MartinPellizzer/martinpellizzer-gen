    "intro": "Acanthocereus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus chiapensis is primarily native to Guatemala, Honduras, and the southeastern regions of Mexico. This cactus species is found in the tropical and subtropical climates of these countries. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in open habitats. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range. It is often seen in coastal areas and lowland regions where it thrives in full sun.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus chiapensis was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with suitable arid or semi-arid climates. It has been established in several states, including Texas, Arizona, and California, where it thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along fence lines. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent spread into natural habitats."
