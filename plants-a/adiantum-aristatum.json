    "intro": "Adiantum aristatum, commonly known as the noble maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Adiantum aristatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
