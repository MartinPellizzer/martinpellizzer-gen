    "intro": "Arceuthobium oxycedri var. abigenium, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host, typically the juniper tree. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its stem-like structures that penetrate the host's tissues. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host growth and providing food for wildlife. Its life cycle is closely tied to the reproductive cycle of its host, making it an important component of certain woodland habitats."
