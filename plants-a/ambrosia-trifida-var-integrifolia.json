    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida var. integrifolia, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with smooth, entire margins and a tall, branched stem that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reputation as an allergenic weed. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. The plant is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in full sun."
