    "intro": "Allardtia cyanea, commonly known as the bluebell orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in spring and are known for their intricate, tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Allardtia cyanea is considered a rare and endangered species."
