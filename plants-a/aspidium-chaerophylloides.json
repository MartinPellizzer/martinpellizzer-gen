    "intro": "Aspidium chaerophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it attaches itself to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Aspidium chaerophylloides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
