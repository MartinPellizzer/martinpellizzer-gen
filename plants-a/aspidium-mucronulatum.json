    "intro": "Aspidium mucronulatum, commonly known as the narrow-point maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Aspidium mucronulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
