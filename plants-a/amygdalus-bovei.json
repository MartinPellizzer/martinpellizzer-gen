    "intro": "Amygdalus bovei, commonly known as the Bove's almond, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by elliptical, green fruits that mature into a hard, woody shell. Its seeds, enclosed within the fruit, are edible when properly processed, similar to common almonds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amygdalus bovei is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of conservation interest."
