    "intro": "Astronidium, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their spiny stems and showy yellow flowers. Astronidium species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with a branching structure. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring succulent stems that store water. The flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
