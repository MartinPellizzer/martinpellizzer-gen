    "intro": "Aquilaria agallocha, commonly known as gharra or agarwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is known for its unique ability to produce a resinous substance in response to fungal infections. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and slightly leathery, while its flowers are small and fragrant. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
