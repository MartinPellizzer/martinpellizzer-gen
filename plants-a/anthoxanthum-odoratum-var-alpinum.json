    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, light green leaves that emit a subtle, sweet aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal practices."
