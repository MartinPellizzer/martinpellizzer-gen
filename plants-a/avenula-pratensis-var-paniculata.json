    "intro": "Avenula pratensis var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe. It features slender, triangular stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces panicles of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of greenish-yellow. It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
