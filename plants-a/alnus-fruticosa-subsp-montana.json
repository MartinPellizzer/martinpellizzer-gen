    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and consist of 5-9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The mountain alder plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
