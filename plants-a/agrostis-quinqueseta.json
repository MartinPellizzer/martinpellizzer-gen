    "intro": "Agrostis quinqueseta, commonly known as the five-awned bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the presence of five awns on its seed heads, which are bristle-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit and forms dense mats, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. Agrostis quinqueseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
