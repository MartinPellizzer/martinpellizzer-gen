    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax wilsonii var. pilosulus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in temperate forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This variant is particularly associated with the forests of the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood and coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax wilsonii var. pilosulus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and forest edges, often growing as a shrub or small tree. This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and potential medicinal properties, making it a popular choice in horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its invasive potential in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been successfully cultivated in various parts of the world beyond its native range."
