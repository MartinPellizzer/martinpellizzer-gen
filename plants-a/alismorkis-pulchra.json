    "intro": "Alismorkis pulchra, commonly known as the pretty water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Alismorkis pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
