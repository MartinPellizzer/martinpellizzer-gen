    "intro": "Armatocereus arduus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
