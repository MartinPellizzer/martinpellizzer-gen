    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive tufts of foliage that give it a unique appearance. This grass is typically found in cool, moist environments such as lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its growth habit involves both rhizomes and stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences."
