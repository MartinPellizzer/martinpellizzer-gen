    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. biauratum, commonly known as the twin-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
