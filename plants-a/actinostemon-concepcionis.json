    "intro": "Actinostemon concepcionis, commonly known as the Concepci\u00f3n starwort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in moist, rocky soils, and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
