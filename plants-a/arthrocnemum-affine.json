    "intro": "Arthrocnemum affine, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in coastal dunes and desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically reduced to scales or spines, minimizing water loss. Arthrocnemum affine is well-adapted to extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system and a waxy coating on its stems to reduce transpiration. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
