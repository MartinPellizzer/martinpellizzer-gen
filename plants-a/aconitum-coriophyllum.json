    "intro": "Aconitum coriophyllum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.",
