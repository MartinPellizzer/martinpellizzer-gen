    "intro": "Agrostis multicaulis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dense, low tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Agrostis multicaulis is valued for its fine texture and is used in turfgrass management and ecological restoration projects."
