    "intro": "Astragalus hymenocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
