    "intro": "Anemone chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa anemone, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central China. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in early spring, forming clusters at the ends of leafy stems. Anemone chapaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ephemeral beauty."
