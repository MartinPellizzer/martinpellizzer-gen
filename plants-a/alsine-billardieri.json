    "intro": "Alsine billardieri, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alsine billardieri is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
