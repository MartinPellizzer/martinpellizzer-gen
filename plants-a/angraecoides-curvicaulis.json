    "intro": "Angraecoides curvicaulis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
