    "intro": "Ayenia lobata, commonly known as the clustered greenbriar, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Ayenia lobata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
