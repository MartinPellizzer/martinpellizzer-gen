    "intro": "Astraea divaricata, commonly known as the variegated star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Astraea divaricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to provide habitat for various small invertebrates."
