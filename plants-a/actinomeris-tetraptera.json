    "intro": "Actinomeris tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.",
