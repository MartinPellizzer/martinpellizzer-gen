It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its blooms, which range from pink to purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aphora lanceolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
