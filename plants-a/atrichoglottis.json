    "intro": "Atrichoglottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Atrichoglottis is considered an endangered species."
