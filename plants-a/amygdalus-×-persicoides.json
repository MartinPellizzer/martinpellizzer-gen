    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 persicoides, commonly known as the Chinese peach or peaches of China, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus persica (peach) and Prunus davidiana (David plum). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces showy pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The botanical characteristics of Amygdalus \u00d7 persicoides make it a valuable species for horticultural and ecological studies."
