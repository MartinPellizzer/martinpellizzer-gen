This variant of the acanthus plant is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cliffs, sea walls, and disturbed coastal environments. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny leaves and showy, spires of pink or purple flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius var. volubilis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant. This variety is particularly favored in regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its introduction has led to its presence in both cultivated and naturalized settings in various parts of the world. However, it is important to note that its spread can sometimes pose challenges in certain ecosystems."
