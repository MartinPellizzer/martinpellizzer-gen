    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. strigosula, commonly known as the fuzzy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
