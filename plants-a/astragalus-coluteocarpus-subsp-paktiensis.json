    "intro": "Astragalus coluteocarpus subsp. paktiensis, commonly known as the Paktian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Afghanistan and southern Tajikistan. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to cream-colored flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
