    "intro": "Amoria cernua, commonly known as the bent-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or yellow throat. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or crinkled. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Amoria cernua is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
