    "intro": "Alopecurus tonsus, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Alopecurus tonsus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
