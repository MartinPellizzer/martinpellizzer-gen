    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon glabriflorum is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This species is commonly found in the wild in these regions, particularly in areas with warm and humid climates. It thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of these Mexican regions. Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in the biodiversity of central and southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon glabriflorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond cultivated gardens. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
