    "intro": "Anthemis rupestris, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthemis rupestris is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
