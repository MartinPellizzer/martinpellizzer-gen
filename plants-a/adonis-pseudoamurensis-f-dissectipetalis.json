    "intro": "Adonis pseudoamurensis f. dissectipetalis, commonly known as the dissect-leaved adonis, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to specific regions of eastern Russia. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals that are distinctly dissected, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
