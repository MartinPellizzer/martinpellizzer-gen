    "intro": "Antennaria nubigena, commonly known as the cloud cushion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and often form a tight rosette near the ground. Antennaria nubigena is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations."
