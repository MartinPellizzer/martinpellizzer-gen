    "intro": "Arundo pliniana subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania reed, is a perennial grass native to North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. This subspecies thrives in wet or semi-aquatic environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and saline soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense vegetation. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including drought and salinity."
