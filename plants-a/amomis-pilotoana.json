    "intro": "Amomis pilotoana, commonly known as the pilotana amomis, is a tropical plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are sometimes harvested for their purported medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, Amomis pilotoana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
