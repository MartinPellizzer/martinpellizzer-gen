    "intro": "Angraecum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender star orchid, is a rare and captivating epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique flowering pattern, which occurs during the night, is an adaptation to its specific pollinators. Angraecum gracillimum is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
