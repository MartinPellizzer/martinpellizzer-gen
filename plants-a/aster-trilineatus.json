It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have three distinct veins, giving it its common name.
