    "intro": "Aechmea gustavoi, commonly known as the Gustavo's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often with a striking contrast against the foliage. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in the central rosette, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. Aechmea gustavoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
