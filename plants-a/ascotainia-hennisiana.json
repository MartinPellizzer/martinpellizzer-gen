The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
