    "intro": "Anemia coriacea var. immeensis, commonly known as the Imme's toughleaf, is a rare variant of the Anemia coriacea species, characterized by its thick, leathery foliage. It is native to specific regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dark green, waxy leaves that are resistant to drought. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
