    "intro": "Asplenium fabianum, commonly known as the Fabian's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture. Asplenium fabianum is a non-woody plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with high humidity."
