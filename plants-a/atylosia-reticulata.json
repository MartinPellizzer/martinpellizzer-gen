    "intro": "Atylosia reticulata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, rounded growth habit and is often found in rocky soils and arid environments. Atylosia reticulata is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 1 meter in height. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
