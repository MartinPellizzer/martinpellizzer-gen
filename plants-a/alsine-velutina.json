    "intro": "Alsine velutina, commonly known as velvet alsike, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are hairy and somewhat succulent, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Alsine velutina is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soil."
