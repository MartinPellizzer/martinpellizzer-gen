    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. hibernica, commonly known as the Hibernian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations."
