    "intro": "Astragalus trichopodus var. trichopodus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus trichopodus var. trichopodus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
