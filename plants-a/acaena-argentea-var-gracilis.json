    "intro": "Acaena argentea var. gracilis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. gracilis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and subalpine environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. gracilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its extensive root system. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management practices."
