    "intro": "Agrostis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis celebica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
