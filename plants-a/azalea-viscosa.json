    "intro": "Azalea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky azalea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus within the Ericaceae family, which includes many other ornamental shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Azalea viscosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its sticky resinous sap, which gives it its common name, can be a distinguishing feature when identifying the plant in the wild."
