    "intro": "Anemone cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Anemone cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
