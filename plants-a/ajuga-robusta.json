    "intro": "Ajuga robusta, commonly known as carpet bugle or broadleaf bugle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dense foliage that forms a carpet-like appearance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring. Ajuga robusta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering display. It is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil quality in woodland gardens."
