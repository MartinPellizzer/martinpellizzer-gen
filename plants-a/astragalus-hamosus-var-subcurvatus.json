    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus var. subcurvatus, commonly known as the bent-stem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, often twisted stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
