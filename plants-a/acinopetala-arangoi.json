    "intro": "Acinopetala arangoi, commonly known as the Arango's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",
