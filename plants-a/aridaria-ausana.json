It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens in desert regions."
