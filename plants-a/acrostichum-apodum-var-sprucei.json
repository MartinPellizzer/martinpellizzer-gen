    "intro": "Acrostichum apodum var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a dark green color. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.",
