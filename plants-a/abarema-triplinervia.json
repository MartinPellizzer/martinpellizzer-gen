    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema triplinervia is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. Its natural range includes regions such as Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema triplinervia was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. However, it has raised concerns as a potential invasive species in some areas. Its distribution is expanding due to human activity and climate change."
