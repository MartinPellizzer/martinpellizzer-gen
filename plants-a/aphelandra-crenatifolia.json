    "intro": "Aphelandra crenatifolia, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Aphelandra crenatifolia prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in warm climates."
