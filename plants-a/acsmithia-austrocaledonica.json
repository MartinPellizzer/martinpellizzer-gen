    "intro": "Acsmithia austrocaledonica, commonly known as the Southern Kauri, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are a vital food source for local wildlife. Acsmithia austrocaledonica is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as a vulnerable species.",
