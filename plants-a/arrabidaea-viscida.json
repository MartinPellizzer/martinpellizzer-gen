    "intro": "Arrabidaea viscida, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in musical instruments and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
