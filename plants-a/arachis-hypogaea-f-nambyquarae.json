    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea f. nambyquarae, commonly known as the Nambyquara peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its distinct morphological features. This subspecies is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is adapted to specific ecological conditions. It exhibits unique traits such as a more compact growth habit and altered pod morphology compared to typical peanuts. The plant produces edible seeds enclosed in underground pods, similar to other peanut species. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
