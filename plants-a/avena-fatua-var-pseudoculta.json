    "intro": "Avena fatua var. pseudoculta, commonly known as common oatgrass, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. It is an annual grass that typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that contain small, two-rowed grains, which are often dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a significant weed in agricultural fields. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological traits that differ slightly from the typical Avena fatua, particularly in leaf structure and seed morphology."
