    "intro": "Arenaria poeppigiana, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arenaria poeppigiana is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed habitats."
