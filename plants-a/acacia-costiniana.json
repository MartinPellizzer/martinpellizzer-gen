    "intro": "Acacia costiniana, commonly known as the African acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodlands. Acacia costiniana is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important component of nitrogen-cycling ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia costiniana is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sand plains of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of the region. Acacia costiniana plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia costiniana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in areas where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in parts of Africa, including countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. This plant is often introduced for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is also expanding due to human activities and climate change."
