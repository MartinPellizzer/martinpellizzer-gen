    "intro": "Astrophia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal astrophia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Astrophia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
