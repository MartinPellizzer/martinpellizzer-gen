It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus biflorus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. It is also a species of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators."
