    "intro": "Artemisia keiskeana, commonly known as silverleaf artemisia, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in compact, spherical clusters called heads. Artemisia keiskeana is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antimicrobial properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
