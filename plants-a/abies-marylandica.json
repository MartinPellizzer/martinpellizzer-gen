    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies marylandica is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains. It is found in areas of Maryland, West Virginia, and parts of Virginia. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at higher elevations. It is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests and on rocky slopes. The plant is known for its distinctive conical shape and silver-blue foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies marylandica was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types. It was popularized in the 19th century for landscaping purposes, particularly in urban and suburban areas. Despite its ornamental value, it has since naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. The plant's introduction has led to its presence in areas beyond its original range, including parts of the southeastern United States. However, its spread remains limited compared to other invasive species."
