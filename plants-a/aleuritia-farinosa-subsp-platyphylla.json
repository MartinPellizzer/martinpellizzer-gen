    "intro": "Aleuritia farinosa subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf snowberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a grayish appearance. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
