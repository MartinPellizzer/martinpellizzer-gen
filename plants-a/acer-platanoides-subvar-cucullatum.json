    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. cucullatum, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically white-veined and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces showy, white, spathate flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are spiny capsules containing one or two shiny, dark brown seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy.",
