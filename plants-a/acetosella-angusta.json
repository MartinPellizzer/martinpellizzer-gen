    "intro": "Acetosella angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Oxalidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Acetosella angusta is known for its edible leaves, which have a tart, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.",
