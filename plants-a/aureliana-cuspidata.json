    "intro": "Aureliana cuspidata, commonly known as the spike-tipped orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its unique inflorescence, with flowers arranged in a spike-like pattern, makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Aureliana cuspidata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
