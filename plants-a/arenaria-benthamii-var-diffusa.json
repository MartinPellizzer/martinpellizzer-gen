It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
