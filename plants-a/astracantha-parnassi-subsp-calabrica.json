    "intro": "Astracantha parnassi subsp. calabrica, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
