    "intro": "Apocynum palustre, commonly known as swamp dogbane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in eastern North America. It features upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Apocynum palustre contains toxic alkaloids and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated."
