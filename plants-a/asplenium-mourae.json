    "intro": "Asplenium mourae, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Asplenium mourae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
