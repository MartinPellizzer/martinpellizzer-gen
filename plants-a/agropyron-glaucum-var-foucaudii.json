    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. foucaudii, commonly known as the Foucaud's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability, showcasing deep root systems and drought tolerance. This variety is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
