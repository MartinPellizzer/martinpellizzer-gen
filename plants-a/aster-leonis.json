It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Aster leonis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
