    "intro": "Arnica pilosella, commonly known as the hairy snakeroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a reddish or brownish hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in the early summer, which are typically clustered in a single head. It thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Arnica pilosella is known for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential toxicity."
