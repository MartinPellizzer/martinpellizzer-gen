It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Its leaves are edible and have a tart, sour flavor, making it a traditional food source in some cultures. Acetosella myriophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.",
