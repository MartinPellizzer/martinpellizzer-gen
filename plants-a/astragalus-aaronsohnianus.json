    "intro": "Astragalus aaronsohnianus, commonly known as Aaronsohn's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
