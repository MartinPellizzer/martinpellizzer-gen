    "intro": "Altingia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam alder, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tetracentraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits, which are typical of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
