The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
