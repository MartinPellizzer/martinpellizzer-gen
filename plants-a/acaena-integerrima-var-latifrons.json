    "intro": "Acaena integerrima var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited spinsteria, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. These fruits are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena integerrima var. latifrons is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. Its distribution is largely confined to the southern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena integerrima var. latifrons was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
