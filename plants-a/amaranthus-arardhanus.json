It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is an annual herb that thrives in warm climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas. The seeds of Amaranthus arardhanus are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
