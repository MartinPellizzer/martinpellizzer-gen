    "intro": "Actinospora dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in cold, arctic and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, and soil in regions with low temperatures and high humidity. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health.",
