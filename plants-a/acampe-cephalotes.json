    "intro": "Acampe cephalotes, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its fast growth rate and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe cephalotes is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local biodiversity of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe cephalotes was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates to support its growth in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have made it a common invasive species in some regions. However, it is not considered highly invasive and has limited ecological impact compared to other introduced plants."
