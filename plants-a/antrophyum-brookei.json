    "intro": "Antrophyum brookei, commonly known as the Brooke's antrophyum, is a striking member of the Araceae family, native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Antrophyum brookei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses for its unique and exotic appearance."
