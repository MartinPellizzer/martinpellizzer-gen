    "intro": "Allium elburzense, commonly known as the Elburz garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and umbels of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, ovoid bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
