It features strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, spherical, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor similar to that of regular onions. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
