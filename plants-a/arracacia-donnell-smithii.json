    "intro": "Arracacia donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's arracacha, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Peru and Bolivia. The plant features a stout, cylindrical root that is typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive fern-like appearance, and it produces small, umbellate flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with potential interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
