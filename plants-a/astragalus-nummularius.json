    "intro": "Astragalus nummularius, commonly known as the silver dollar milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green, round leaves that resemble silver coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Astragalus nummularius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
