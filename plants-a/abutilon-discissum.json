    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon discissum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with rainforests and riverine habitats, where it thrives in humid conditions. It is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains concentrated in the aforementioned South American countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon discissum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of streams and rivers. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in Washington, Oregon, and California. Its spread is often associated with human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal."
