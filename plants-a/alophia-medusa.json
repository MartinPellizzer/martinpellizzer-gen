    "intro": "Alophia medusa, commonly known as the Medusa lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-like structure at the base of the flower, which resembles the mythological figure of Medusa. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alophia medusa is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal maintenance in suitable climates."
