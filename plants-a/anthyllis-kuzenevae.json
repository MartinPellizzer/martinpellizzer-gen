It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Anthyllis kuzenevae is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
