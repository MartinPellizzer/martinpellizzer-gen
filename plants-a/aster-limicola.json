    "intro": "Aster limicola, commonly known as the marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Aster limicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
