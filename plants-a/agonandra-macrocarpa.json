It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Agonandra macrocarpa is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
