It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
