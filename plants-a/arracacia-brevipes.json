    "intro": "Arracacia brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its short, thick rhizomes that store starch. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Arracacia brevipes is often cultivated for its edible rhizomes, which are used in traditional cuisines and as a starch source."
