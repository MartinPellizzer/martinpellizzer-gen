    "intro": "Ammannia sagittata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its stems are often reddish in color, and the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
