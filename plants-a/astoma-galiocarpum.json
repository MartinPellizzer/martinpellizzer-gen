    "intro": "Astoma galiocarpum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layers of dense forests. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season, and are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Astoma galiocarpum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
