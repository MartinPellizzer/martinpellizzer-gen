    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. opizii, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which are often described as having a subtle, honey-like fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
