    "intro": "Acalypha annobonae, commonly known as the Annobon Island spurflower, is a shrub native to the island of Annob\u00f3n in the Gulf of Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in coastal areas and moist woodlands. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha annobonae is primarily native to the Gulf of Guinea Islands. This plant is found in coastal areas of these islands, where it thrives in moist, tropical climates. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and saltwater environments. The species is endemic to this region, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world. Its distribution is limited to specific islands within the Gulf of Guinea, highlighting its unique ecological niche.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha annobonae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread through both intentional planting and accidental dispersal. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often establishing itself in disturbed areas such as roadsides and coastal regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a noxious weed in several areas where it has outcompeted native vegetation."
