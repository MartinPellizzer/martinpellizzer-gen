It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
