    "intro": "Atriplex bonnevillensis, commonly known as the Bonneville saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems. The plant's extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in harsh landscapes."
