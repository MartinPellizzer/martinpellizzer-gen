    "intro": "Allium narcissifolium, commonly known as the narcissus leaf garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves that resemble those of daffodils, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a loose umbel. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions."
