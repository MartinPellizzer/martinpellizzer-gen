It is characterized by its sprawling, vine-like growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along surfaces. The plant produces spiny stems and flat, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white hairs. It bears yellow flowers that are followed by fleshy, red fruits containing edible seeds. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
