    "intro": "Astragalus beckwithii var. weiserensis, commonly known as the Weiser's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and geographic distribution."
