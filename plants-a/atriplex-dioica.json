    "intro": "Atriplex dioica, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are often covered with a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight. Atriplex dioica is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and deserts."
