    "intro": "Aristida longiseta var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's threeawn, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
