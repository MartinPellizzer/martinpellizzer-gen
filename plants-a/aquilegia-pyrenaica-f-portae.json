    "intro": "Aquilegia pyrenaica f. portae, commonly known as the Pyrenean columbine, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Pyrenees region. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces clusters of small, showy flowers in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
