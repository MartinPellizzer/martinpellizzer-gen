    "intro": "Alsine grineensis, commonly known as the Crimean sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of soil degradation. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
