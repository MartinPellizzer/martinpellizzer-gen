    "intro": "Agathis vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the South Pacific, particularly found in parts of Fiji and Tonga. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones and has a slow growth rate, making it valuable for timber and ecological purposes. Its wood is highly resistant to decay, which contributes to its historical use in construction and shipbuilding."
