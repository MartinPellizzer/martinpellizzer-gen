    "intro": "Astragalus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it thrives in cold, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are usually compound with several leaflets. Astragalus glacialis is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
