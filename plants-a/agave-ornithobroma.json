    "intro": "Agave ornithobroma, commonly known as the hummingbird agave, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, white flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
