    "intro": "Alchemilla glomerulans f. dasycalyx, commonly known as the fuzzy-leaved lady's mantle, is a compact perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves that are densely hairy, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its textured foliage and delicate floral display."
