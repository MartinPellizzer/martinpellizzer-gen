    "intro": "Alliaria petiolata, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a garlic-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by triangular seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded areas, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though its ecological impact is significant."
