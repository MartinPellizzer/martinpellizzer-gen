    "intro": "Allosorus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy allosorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in humid conditions."
