    "intro": "Atriplex spicata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex spicata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
