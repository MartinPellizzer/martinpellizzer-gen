    "intro": "Aloe subtuberculata, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Aloe subtuberculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
