    "intro": "Arisaema robustum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-tailed arisaema, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, spatulate bract. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers located on separate parts of the spadix. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
