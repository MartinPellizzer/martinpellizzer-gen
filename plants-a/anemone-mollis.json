    "intro": "Anemone mollis, commonly known as the fuzzy mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features soft, velvety foliage with rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Anemone mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
