    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens var. flabellata, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, waxy leaves that are often described as having a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
