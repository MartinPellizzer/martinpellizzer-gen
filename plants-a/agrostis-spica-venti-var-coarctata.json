    "intro": "Agrostis spica-venti var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed, a feature that aligns with its common name, which translates to \"wind spike grass.\" It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
