It is characterized by its large, ornate inflorescence that resembles a phallus, hence its scientific name. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a spatulate tepal that is typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested soils. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
