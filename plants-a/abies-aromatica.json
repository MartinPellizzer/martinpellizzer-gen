    "intro": "Abies aromatica, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in its natural habitat. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters. Its needles are flat, soft, and have a fragrant resinous scent, which contributes to its common name. Abies aromatica plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies aromatica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in coniferous forests and alpine meadows where the climate is cold and the soil is well-drained. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of the local flora. The plant plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies aromatica was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun. It is often found in mountainous regions and high elevation forests, where it forms dense stands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal, with its aromatic foliage and cone-bearing characteristics. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe, for horticultural and reforestation purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
