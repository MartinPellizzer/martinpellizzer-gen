    "intro": "Asplenium projectum, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. It has delicate, linear leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves. It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Asplenium projectum is relatively easy to care for and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or terrariums."
