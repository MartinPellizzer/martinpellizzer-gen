    "intro": "Ambrosia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweeds. Ambrosia glandulosa is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient weed and a potential allergen."
