    "intro": "Acacia ancistrophylla var. ancistrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ancistrophylla var. ancistrophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native range. The plant is an important component of the local flora and is often seen in shrublands and woodland communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ancistrophylla var. ancistrophylla was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South Australia, where it is commonly planted for its ornamental value. It is often used in landscaping due to its distinctive silver foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions. This plant is also found in coastal regions, where it can stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a Mediterranean climate."
