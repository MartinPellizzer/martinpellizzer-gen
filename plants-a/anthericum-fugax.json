    "intro": "Anthericum fugax, commonly known as the transient lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist habitats effectively. Anthericum fugax is notable for its short blooming period, which contributes to its common name."
