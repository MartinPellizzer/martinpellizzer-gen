It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, often with a distinctive auricle-like appendage at the base of each petal. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to collections of alpine and rock garden plants."
