It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is notable for its intricate arrangement of stamens and carpels. The plant exhibits a monotypic genus, meaning it is the sole member of its genus, highlighting its evolutionary distinctiveness. Its botanical features are adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
