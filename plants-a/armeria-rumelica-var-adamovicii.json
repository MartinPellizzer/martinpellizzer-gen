It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for rock gardens or dry landscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to alpine and Mediterranean-style gardens."
