It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.",
