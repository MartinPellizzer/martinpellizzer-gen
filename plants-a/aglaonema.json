    "intro": "Aglaonema, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that comes in shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Aglaonema species are evergreen, meaning they retain their leaves year-round, making them popular houseplants. Their ornamental value is enhanced by their compact growth habit and minimal care requirements."
