    "intro": "Alchemilla heptakteis, commonly known as the seven-leafed lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla heptakteis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
