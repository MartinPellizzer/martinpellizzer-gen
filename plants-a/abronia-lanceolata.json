    "intro": "Abronia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia lanceolata is primarily native to the coastal areas of California and Oregon in the United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. This species is commonly found in dunes and beach habitats where it can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss and development, its distribution has become increasingly limited.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia lanceolata was mainly introduced to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Pacific Northwest. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant has become established in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. However, it is currently considered a non-invasive species in its introduced range."
