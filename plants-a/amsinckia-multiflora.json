It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
