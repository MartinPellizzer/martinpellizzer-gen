    "intro": "Aconitum kishidae, commonly known as the Kishida aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that contributes to its ornamental value. Like other aconites, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.",
