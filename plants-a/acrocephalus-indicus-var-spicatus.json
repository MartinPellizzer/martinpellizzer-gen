    "intro": "Acrocephalus indicus var. spicatus, commonly known as the spiculate marsh warbler, is a variant of the marsh warbler native to wetland habitats in South and Southeast Asia. It is a small, insectivorous bird with a distinctive, slender body and a long, pointed bill adapted for foraging in dense vegetation. The plant's botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in marshy areas, often near water bodies, and is closely associated with wetland ecosystems. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for the health of wetland environments.",
