    "intro": "Anopteris stricta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow, leathery, and dark green, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on cliffs. Anopteris stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
