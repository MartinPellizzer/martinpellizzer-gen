    "intro": "Avena ventricosa, commonly known as the burr oat or smooth oat, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts. Avena ventricosa thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
