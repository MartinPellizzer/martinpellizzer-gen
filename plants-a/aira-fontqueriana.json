    "intro": "Aira fontqueriana, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet to moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens or as a ground cover."
