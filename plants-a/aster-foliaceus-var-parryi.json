    "intro": "Aster foliaceus var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's leafy aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. It is also adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
