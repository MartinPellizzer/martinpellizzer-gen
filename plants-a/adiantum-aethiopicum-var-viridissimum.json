    "intro": "Adiantum aethiopicum var. viridissimum, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a variety of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, bright green fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and prefers moist, shaded environments. It has rhizomatous growth and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.",
