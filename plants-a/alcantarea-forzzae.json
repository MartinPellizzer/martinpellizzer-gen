    "intro": "Alcantarea forzzae, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to the rocky slopes of Brazil. It features a tall, sparsely branched stem with showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble orchid petals. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires bright, indirect light. Alcantarea forzzae is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
