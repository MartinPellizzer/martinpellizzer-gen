    "intro": "Anthurium nymphaeifolium var. fulcratum, commonly known as the water lily anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are bright red or orange in color, surrounded by a showy white spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
