    "intro": "Adiantum proliferum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States. It features feathery, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies. Adiantum proliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.",
