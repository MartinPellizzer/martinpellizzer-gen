    "intro": "Azorella prolifera, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure composed of tightly packed, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in umbels. Azorella prolifera is well adapted to high-altitude environments, tolerating cold temperatures and strong winds. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and harsh climatic conditions."
