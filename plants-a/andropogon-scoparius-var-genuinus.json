    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. genuinus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and role in stabilizing soil."
