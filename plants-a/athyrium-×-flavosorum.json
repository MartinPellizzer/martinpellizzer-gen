    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 flavosorum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with golden to orange spore cases, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage, contributing to its ornamental value. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually located at the base of the plant, and they play a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle."
