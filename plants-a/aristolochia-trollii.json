    "intro": "Aristolochia trollii, commonly known as the troll's pipe or the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, often twisted flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its vines can grow quite long, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens due to its potential hazards."
