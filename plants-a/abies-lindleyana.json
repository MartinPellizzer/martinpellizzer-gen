    "intro": "Abies lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are flat, dark green, and have a subtle resinous scent, while the cones are typically short and cylindrical. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The plant has ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies lindleyana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar. It thrives in temperate to subalpine climates, typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other conifers such as fir and pine. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with moist, cool environments. The plant is an important component of the biodiversity in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies lindleyana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northern hemisphere. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. This species has been introduced to several countries in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. It is often cultivated in gardens and used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems."
