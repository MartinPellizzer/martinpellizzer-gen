    "intro": "Agrostis virescens, commonly known as green bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis virescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
