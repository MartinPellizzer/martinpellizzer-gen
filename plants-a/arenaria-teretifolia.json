    "intro": "Arenaria teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, thread-like stems and small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
