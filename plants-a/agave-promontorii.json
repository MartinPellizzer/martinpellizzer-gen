    "intro": "Agave promontorii, commonly known as the Promontory agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, white berries. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
