These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and vibrant, often blue or purple flowers. They are typically found in arid and coastal environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Amphimas species are adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including high salinity and limited water availability. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
