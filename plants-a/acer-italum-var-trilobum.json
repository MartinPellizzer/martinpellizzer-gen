    "intro": "Acer italum var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three distinct lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and landscaped areas.",
