    "intro": "Aquilegia montsicciana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada columbine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces clusters of small, showy flowers in early to mid-summer. Aquilegia montsicciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
