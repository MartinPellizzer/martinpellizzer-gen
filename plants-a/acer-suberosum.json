    "intro": "Acer suberosum, commonly known as the red maple or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Acer suberosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges.",
