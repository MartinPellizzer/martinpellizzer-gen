It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three bracteate flowers. Agrostis micrandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
