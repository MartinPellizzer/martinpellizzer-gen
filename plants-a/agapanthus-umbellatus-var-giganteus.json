It features dense, upright clusters of large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are evergreen and form a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
