    "intro": "Aristolochia kaempferi f. mirabilis, commonly known as the Japanese birthwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Japan and Korea, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage, making it important to handle with care."
