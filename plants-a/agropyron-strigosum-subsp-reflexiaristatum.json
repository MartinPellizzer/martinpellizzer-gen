    "intro": "Agropyron strigosum subsp. reflexiaristatum, commonly known as the reflexed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
