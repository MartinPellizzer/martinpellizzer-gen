    "intro": "Arctium pallidivirens, commonly known as the pale-green burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces spiny, woody fruits called burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically pink or purple. Arctium pallidivirens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in meadows and woodland edges."
