    "intro": "Allium juldusicola, commonly known as the Juldus garlic, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Allium genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This plant is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
