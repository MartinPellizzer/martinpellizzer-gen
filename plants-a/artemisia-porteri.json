    "intro": "Artemisia porteri, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia porteri is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
