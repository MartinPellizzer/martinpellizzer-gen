    "intro": "Aloe capitata, commonly known as the cannonball aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
