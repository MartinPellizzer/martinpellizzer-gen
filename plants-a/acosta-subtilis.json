    "intro": "Acosta subtilis, commonly known as the subtle acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta subtilis is considered a vulnerable species.",
