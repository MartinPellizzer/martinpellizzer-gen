    "intro": "Albizia obbiadensis, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Albizia obbiadensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
