    "intro": "Achyropsis avicularis, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy to conserve water. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.",
