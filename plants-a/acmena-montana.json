    "intro": "Acmena montana, commonly known as the mountain acmena, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Acmena montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for native wildlife.",
