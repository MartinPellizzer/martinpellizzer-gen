    "intro": "Artemisia subspinescens, commonly known as the spiny wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Artemisia subspinescens is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous communities."
