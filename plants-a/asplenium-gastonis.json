    "intro": "Asplenium gastonis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium gastonis is typically found in moist, humid conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in challenging, nutrient-poor soils."
