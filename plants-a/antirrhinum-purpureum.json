    "intro": "Antirrhinum purpureum, commonly known as the purple snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Antirrhinum purpureum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
