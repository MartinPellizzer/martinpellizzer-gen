    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. subrubens, commonly known as the red sandrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
