    "intro": "Aphanes berteroana, commonly known as the Chilean sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Aphanes berteroana is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
