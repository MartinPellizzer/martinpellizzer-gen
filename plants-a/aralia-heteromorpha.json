    "intro": "Aralia heteromorpha, commonly known as the giant aralia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it one of the largest leafy plants in the Araliaceae family. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for humans and birds. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
