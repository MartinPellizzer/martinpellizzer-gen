    "intro": "Aloe torrei var. wildii, commonly known as the Wildii Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
