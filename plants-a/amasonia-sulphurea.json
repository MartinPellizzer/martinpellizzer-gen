    "intro": "Amasonia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur yellow sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller, darker yellow florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly sticky texture. Amasonia sulphurea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
