    "intro": "Alisma subalatum var. majus, commonly known as the tall water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom during the summer months. This variant is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other varieties within the Alisma genus."
