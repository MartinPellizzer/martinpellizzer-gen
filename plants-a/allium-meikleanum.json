    "intro": "Allium meikleanum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, round bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like aroma, it is cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
