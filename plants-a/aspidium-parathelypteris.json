    "intro": "Aspidium parathelypteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
