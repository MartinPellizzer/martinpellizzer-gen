    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. rivularis, commonly known as white bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize disturbed sites effectively. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects."
