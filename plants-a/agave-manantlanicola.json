    "intro": "Agave manantlanicola, commonly known as the Manantlan agave, is a species native to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves for survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
