    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus glaucus is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and parts of Greece. This plant thrives in coastal areas and limestone soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. It is known for its striking silver-gray foliage and spires of blue or purple flowers. Acanthus glaucus is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to Mediterranean climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus glaucus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its striking silver-green foliage and spires of blue flowers. It has become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. However, it is considered a non-native species and is not typically invasive in the regions where it is established."
