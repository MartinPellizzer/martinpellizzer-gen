    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 versicolor, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, derived from Aesculus glabra and Aesculus hippocastanum. The horse chestnut is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
