    "intro": "Ajuga trifidifolia, commonly known as common bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga trifidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
