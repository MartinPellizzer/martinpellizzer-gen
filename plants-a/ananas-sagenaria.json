It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces a fragrant, edible fruit that is smaller and more tart than the common pineapple. Its botanical features include a fibrous stem and a flowering spike that bears small, white flowers. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a golden-yellow color and is often used in culinary applications."
