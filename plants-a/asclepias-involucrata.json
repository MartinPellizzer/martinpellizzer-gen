    "intro": "Asclepias involucrata, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers with distinctive, horn-like seed pods that mature into fluffy, white-tufted structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Asclepias involucrata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
