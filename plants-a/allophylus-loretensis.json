    "intro": "Allophylus loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and small, bright red berries that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color. Allophylus loretensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
