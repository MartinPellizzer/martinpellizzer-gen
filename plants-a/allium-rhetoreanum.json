    "intro": "Allium rhetoreanum, commonly known as the Greek leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flower stalks that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in umbels. Its bulbous structure is similar to other Allium species, but it is distinguished by its unique habitat and historical use in traditional medicine. Allium rhetoreanum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas."
