    "intro": "Artemisia arctica subsp. beringensis, commonly known as Beringian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
