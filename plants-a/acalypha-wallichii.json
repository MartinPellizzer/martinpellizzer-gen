    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha wallichii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in the understory of forests and is often associated with humid climates. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and the Philippines. Its natural habitat includes lowland forests and mountainous regions up to an elevation of 1,500 meters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wallichii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It has been widely cultivated in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can compete with native vegetation. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in its introduced range."
