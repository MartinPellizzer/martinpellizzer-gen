    "intro": "Athyrium fimbristegium, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, frayed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the soil. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
