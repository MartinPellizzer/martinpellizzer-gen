    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon olympicum is primarily native to Turkey. This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern part of the country. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to a few localized habitats within Turkey. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon olympicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This plant thrives in cooler climates and is often associated with open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and streambanks. It has been introduced to several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas."
