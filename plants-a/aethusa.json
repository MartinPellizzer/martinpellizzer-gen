    "intro": "Aethusa, commonly known as hemlock, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound leaves with a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Aethusa contains toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its dangers, it has historically been used in traditional medicine and as a symbol in various cultural contexts."
