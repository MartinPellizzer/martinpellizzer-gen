    "intro": "Asparagus engleri, commonly known as the Chinese asparagus fern, is a perennial evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense rosette of feathery, grass-like leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Asparagus engleri is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
