    "intro": "Androcymbium circinatum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its harsh, wind-exposed environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, making it difficult to spot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
