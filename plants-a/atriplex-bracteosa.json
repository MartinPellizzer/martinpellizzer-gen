    "intro": "Atriplex bracteosa, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex bracteosa is adapted to poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush communities."
