    "intro": "Agropyron petraeum, commonly known as the mountain wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the European Alps. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron petraeum is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and high altitudes. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
