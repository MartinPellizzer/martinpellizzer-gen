    "intro": "Alliaria mollissima, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. The leaves and seeds are edible, though they have a pungent, garlic-like flavor."
