It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus luteus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
