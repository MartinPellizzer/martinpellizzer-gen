    "intro": "Agropyron, commonly known as wheatgrass, is a genus of grasses that includes several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. Agropyron species are typically perennial, with rhizomatous or stoloniferous growth patterns that allow them to spread and establish in various environments. They are valued for their nutritional content, particularly in livestock feed and human consumption as a health food. Some species are also used in erosion control due to their hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
