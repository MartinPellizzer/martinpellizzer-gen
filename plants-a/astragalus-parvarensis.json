    "intro": "Astragalus parvarensis, commonly known as the small mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
