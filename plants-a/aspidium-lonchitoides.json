    "intro": "Aspidium lonchitoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium lonchitoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
