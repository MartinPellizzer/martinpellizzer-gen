It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Asteraceae family. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Anil stricta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
