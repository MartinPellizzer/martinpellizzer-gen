    "intro": "Angraecum decaryanum, commonly known as the Decary's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique inflorescence with a single, elongated spike bearing multiple flowers, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
