    "intro": "Androsace ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure at the base. Androsace ovczinnikovii is adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a rare and specialized member of its ecosystem."
