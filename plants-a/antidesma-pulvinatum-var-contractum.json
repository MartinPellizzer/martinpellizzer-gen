    "intro": "Antidesma pulvinatum var. contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf antidesma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain minute seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
