    "intro": "Asplenium tenerum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often clustered close to the ground. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium tenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
