    "intro": "Aristolochia pacayacensis, commonly known as the Pacaya sacha vine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often aromatic flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, which is a common feature among members of its genus. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and can grow as a climbing vine or shrub. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish in color, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
