    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. natans, commonly known as water mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in spikes during the summer months. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
