    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. communis, commonly known as the common whitethorn, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and spiny stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It has small, compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
