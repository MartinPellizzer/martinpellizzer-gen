    "intro": "Arctostaphylos laevigata, commonly known as the smooth manzanita, is a shrub native to California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and evergreen foliage composed of leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Arctostaphylos laevigata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
