    "intro": "Anemone baikalensis subsp. rossii, commonly known as the Siberian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with cool, moist conditions."
