    "intro": "Alsophila killipii, commonly known as the Killip's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
