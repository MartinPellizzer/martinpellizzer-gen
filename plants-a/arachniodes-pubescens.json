    "intro": "Arachniodes pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often hairy fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its fronds are usually divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
