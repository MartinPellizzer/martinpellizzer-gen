It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, pappose seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.",
