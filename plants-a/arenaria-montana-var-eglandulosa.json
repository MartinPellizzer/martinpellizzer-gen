It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions."
