    "intro": "Akebia lobata var. quercifoliata, commonly known as the Japanese hop plant, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of an oak, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
