    "intro": "Allium lepidum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs and leaves that are often used in culinary applications, similar to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
