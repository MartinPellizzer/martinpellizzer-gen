    "intro": "Allium furkatii, commonly known as the Kashmiri leek, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Jammu and Kashmir in India. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and clustered, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
