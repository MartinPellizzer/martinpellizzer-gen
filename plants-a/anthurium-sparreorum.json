It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges from red to orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers within a spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often veined with white or silver patterns.
