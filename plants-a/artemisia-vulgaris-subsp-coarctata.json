    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. coarctata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in compact spherical shapes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wastelands. Its essential oils, particularly thujone, contribute to its historical use in medicine and as a flavoring agent."
