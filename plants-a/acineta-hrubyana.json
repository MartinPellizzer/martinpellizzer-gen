    "intro": "Acineta hrubyana, commonly known as the Hruby's acineta, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Acineta hrubyana is known for its delicate structure and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
