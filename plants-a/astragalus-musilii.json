It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry environments. Astragalus musilii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. It is often found in steppe and desert habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
