    "intro": "Agrostis depressa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread readily and form extensive colonies. Agrostis depressa is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and adaptability to various soil conditions."
