    "intro": "Avena sativa subvar. pilosa, commonly known as hairy oat, is a perennial grass species characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, oval grains, which are typically harvested for animal feed or grain. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it a useful plant in erosion control. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing feature that aids in identifying the species."
