    "intro": "Aloe humilis var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny aloe, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, and they are often adorned with small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences bearing orange to red tubular flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
