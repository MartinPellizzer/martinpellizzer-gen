    "intro": "Aegilops juvenalis, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is closely related to modern wheat and is considered a progenitor of domesticated wheat varieties. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its genetic diversity is of significant interest in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield."
