    "intro": "Aeschynomene gilbertoi, commonly known as Gilbert's goffered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands, and it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
