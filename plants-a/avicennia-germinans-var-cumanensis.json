    "intro": "Avicennia germinans var. cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits salt excretion through its leaves, allowing it to thrive in coastal zones. Its small, ovate leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This variant is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
