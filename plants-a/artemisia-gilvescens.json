    "intro": "Artemisia gilvescens, commonly known as golden wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains essential oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
