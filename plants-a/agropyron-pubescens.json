    "intro": "Agropyron pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. It produces spikelet-based inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
