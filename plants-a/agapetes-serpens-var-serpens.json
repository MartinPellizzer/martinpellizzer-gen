    "intro": "Agapetes serpens var. serpens, commonly known as the serpentine agapete, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It typically grows at high elevations, often in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, arranged in a compact, mat-like form. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
