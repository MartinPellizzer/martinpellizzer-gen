    "intro": "Asplenium flabellatum, commonly known as the fan spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to form dense clusters. Asplenium flabellatum is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of humidity levels, making it a resilient species in humid climates."
