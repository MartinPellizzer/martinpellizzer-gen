    "intro": "Acacia subtomentosa, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems covered in a dense layer of silky, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oblong leaflets. Acacia subtomentosa is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subtomentosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Acacia subtomentosa plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subtomentosa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant's deep root system helps improve soil structure and water retention. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which enhance soil fertility. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas."
