    "intro": "Alexitoxicon darvasicum, commonly known as the Crimson Veil Orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals with intricate veining that resembles a delicate web, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its blooming season occurs in late spring, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Alexitoxicon darvasicum is classified as an endangered species."
