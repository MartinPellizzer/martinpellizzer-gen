It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal cliffs and sandy areas. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
