    "intro": "Athyrium australe, commonly known as the Australian lady fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understoreys or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium australe is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
