    "intro": "Acantholimon aegaeum, commonly known as the Aegean sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Aegean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand arid conditions and strong coastal winds. Acantholimon aegaeum is well-suited to coastal environments and is often found in dunes and rocky outcrops.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon aegaeum is primarily native to the East Aegean Is. This plant is found in specific regions of the eastern part of the Aegean Sea, including several islands. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing on limestone substrates. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon aegaeum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flowering stems and foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant is now considered a potential weed in some areas, although its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied. Its distribution in New Zealand is limited compared to its native range in the Mediterranean."
