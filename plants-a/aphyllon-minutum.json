It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
