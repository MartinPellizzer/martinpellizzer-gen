    "intro": "Aconitum album, commonly known as white aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a purple or brownish tint at the base. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain potent alkaloids that make it highly toxic. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
