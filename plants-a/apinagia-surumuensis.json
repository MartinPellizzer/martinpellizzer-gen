    "intro": "Apinagia surumuensis, commonly known as the Surumu sandalwood, is a rare evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has compound leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique, subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Apinagia surumuensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
