It features rosettes of silvery-white, hairy leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
