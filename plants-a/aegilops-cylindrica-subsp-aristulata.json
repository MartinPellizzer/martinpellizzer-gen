It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
