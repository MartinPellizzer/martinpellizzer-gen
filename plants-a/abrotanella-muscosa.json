    "intro": "Abrotanella muscosa, commonly known as woolly thyme or mossy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.",

This plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in rocky or gravelly areas. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella muscosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in forests. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
