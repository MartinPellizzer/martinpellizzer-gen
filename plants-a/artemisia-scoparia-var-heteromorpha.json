    "intro": "Artemisia scoparia var. heteromorpha, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of steppe and shrubland ecosystems. Its essential oils have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
