    "intro": "Alchemilla ambigens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Alchemilla ambigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
