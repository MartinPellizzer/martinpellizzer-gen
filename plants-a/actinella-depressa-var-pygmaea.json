    "intro": "Actinella depressa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes white-tinged underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological value.",
