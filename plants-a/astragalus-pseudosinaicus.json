    "intro": "Astragalus pseudosinaicus, commonly known as Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, and it produces lens-shaped pods containing several seeds."
