    "intro": "Alchemilla ellenbeckii subsp. granvikii, commonly known as the granvik's lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
