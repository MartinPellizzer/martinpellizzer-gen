    "intro": "Acantholimon subavenaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.",

This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and dry steppe habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon subavenaceum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as slopes and gravelly plains. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant has been introduced to parts of California and Oregon in the United States, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed environments. It is often seen growing in coastal areas and along roadsides due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific microclimates and limited seed dispersal mechanisms."
