    "intro": "Angraecum sacciferum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar at the base of the petals. Angraecum sacciferum is notable for its rarity and its historical significance in the study of co-evolution between plants and their pollinators."
