    "intro": "Astronia hatusimae, commonly known as the Hatusima aster, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, fibrous stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives on nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astronia hatusimae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
