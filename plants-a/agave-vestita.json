    "intro": "Agave vestita, commonly known as the velvet agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy succulent suitable for arid climates. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
