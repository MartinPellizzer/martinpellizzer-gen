    "intro": "Aster ascendens var. ciliatifolius, commonly known as the silkyleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, softly hairy leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
