    "intro": "Alafia perrieri var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alafia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its close relatives. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered around the spadix. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native environment."
