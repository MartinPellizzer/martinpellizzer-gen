    "intro": "Amblyopyrum muticum, commonly known as the common meadow grass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, glabrous leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, damp grasslands, and along stream banks. Amblyopyrum muticum plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
