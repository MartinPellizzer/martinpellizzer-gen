    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaves and a succulent stem for water storage. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
