    "intro": "Avenastrum mannii, commonly known as the African grass or wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenastrum mannii is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in arid to semi-arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
