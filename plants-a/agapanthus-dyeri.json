    "intro": "Agapanthus dyeri, commonly known as the African lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense, spherical clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a rosette at the base, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Agapanthus dyeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
