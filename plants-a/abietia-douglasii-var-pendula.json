    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abietia douglasii var. pendula is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions with moist, temperate climates. This variety is often associated with mixed evergreen forests and grows in areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is well adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abietia douglasii var. pendula was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique weeping form and attractive foliage. This variety is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in Washington and Oregon. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun conditions. However, it is considered a non-native species and can sometimes outcompete local vegetation if not managed properly."
