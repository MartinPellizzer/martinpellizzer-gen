    "intro": "Aspidium mascarenense, commonly known as the Mascarene water fern, is a species of fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and sometimes tinged with red or brown. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid coastal areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium mascarenense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range."
