    "intro": "Artemisia arborescens, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
