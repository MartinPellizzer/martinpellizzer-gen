    "intro": "Azalea hispida, commonly known as the rough azalea, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Azalea hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant."
