    "intro": "Amsinckia decumbens, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with ray florets that resemble those of a sunflower, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia decumbens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
