    "intro": "Asplenium platybasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often dark green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium platybasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
