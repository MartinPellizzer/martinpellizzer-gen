    "intro": "Amerosedum radiatum subsp. ciliosum, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The species thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation in its native habitat."
