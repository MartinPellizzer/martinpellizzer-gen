    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia var. decora is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This variety thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is particularly common in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the ecosystem of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia var. decora was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It is commonly found in regions with warm climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in horticulture for its dense, evergreen appearance and ability to tolerate pruning. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond native habitats, contributing to its popularity among landscapers and gardeners. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
