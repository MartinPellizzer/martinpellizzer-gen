    "intro": "Alternanthera denticulata var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf alternanthera, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive red or purple coloration on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in low light conditions. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, though they are not showy. It thrives in moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its blooms."
