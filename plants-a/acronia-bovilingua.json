    "intro": "Acronia bovilingua, commonly known as the whispering bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant produces small, rounded leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms during the cooler months, typically between September and November. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Acronia bovilingua is considered a conservation concern.",
