    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. trichocarpum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is handled with care and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
