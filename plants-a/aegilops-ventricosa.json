    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa, commonly known as the spikelet grass or woolly wild oat, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to temperate regions of Eurasia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy seed heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its inflorescence consists of compact spikelets, and the leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Aegilops ventricosa is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
