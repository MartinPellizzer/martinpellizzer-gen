    "intro": "Adiantum chilense var. subsulphureum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically a striking golden-yellow to bronze color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.",
