    "intro": "Aspidium rockii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in rocky, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Aspidium rockii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
