    "intro": "Alnus viridis proles suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The sweet, aromatic scent of its foliage is a distinguishing feature of this species."
