    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha omissa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and wetlands. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along riverbanks and in open areas. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to warm, moist environments across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha omissa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions contribute to its spread."
