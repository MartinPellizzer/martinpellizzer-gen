    "intro": "Asplenium friesiorum, commonly known as the Fries's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium friesiorum is relatively uncommon and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
