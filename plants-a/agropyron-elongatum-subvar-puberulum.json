    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum subvar. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, often found in alpine and steppe regions. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage crop in certain climates."
