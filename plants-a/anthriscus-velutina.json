    "intro": "Anthriscus velutina, commonly known as cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Anthriscus velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
