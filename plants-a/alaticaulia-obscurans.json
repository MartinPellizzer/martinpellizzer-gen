    "intro": "Alaticaulia obscurans, commonly known as the dark-stemmed alaticaulia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The leaves are small, elliptical, and typically have a dull, grayish-green appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
