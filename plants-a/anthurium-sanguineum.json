    "intro": "Anthurium sanguineum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped, bright red spathes that enclose the small, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant's foliage consists of glossy, dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium sanguineum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
