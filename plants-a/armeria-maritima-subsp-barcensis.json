    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. barcensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
