    "intro": "Anthurium guanchezii, commonly known as the Canary Islands anthurium, is a rare species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the actual flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
