    "intro": "Acalypha velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf or velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name, and its striking, often colorful bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Acalypha velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha velutina is primarily native to the Gal\u00e1pagos. This species is found in the volcanic islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, which is located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It thrives in the unique ecological conditions of this region, including its tropical climate and diverse habitats. The plant is adapted to the island's specific environmental factors, such as soil type and rainfall patterns. Its native distribution is largely restricted to these islands, making it an important part of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha velutina was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through accidental means, such as being transported on ships or in plant materials. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and has spread throughout various lowland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as a noxious weed. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
