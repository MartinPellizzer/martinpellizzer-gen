    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 mucronatum var. membranaceum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
