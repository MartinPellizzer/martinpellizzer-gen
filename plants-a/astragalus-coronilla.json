    "intro": "Astragalus coronilla, commonly known as crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it drought-tolerant. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
