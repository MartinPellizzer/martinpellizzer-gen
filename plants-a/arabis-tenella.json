    "intro": "Arabis tenella, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions."
