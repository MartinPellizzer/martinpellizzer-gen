    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis var. inermis, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a dense growth habit that forms a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and durability, it is frequently used in turfgrass applications."
