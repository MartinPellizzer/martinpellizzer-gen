    "intro": "Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina, commonly known as the sweet acacia or the honey bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in areas with a temperate climate and well-drained soils. This variant is particularly adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers. Its native range extends from southern France to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. curvispina was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its rapid growth and distinctive appearance. It has since spread beyond its original planting sites, becoming naturalized in various habitats such as disturbed soils, roadsides, and coastal areas. The plant's ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions has contributed to its invasive potential in some regions. It is considered a weed in certain areas due to its competitive nature and ability to alter soil chemistry. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has led to ecological concerns in parts of its range."
