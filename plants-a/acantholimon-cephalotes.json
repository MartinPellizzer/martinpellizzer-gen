    "intro": "Acantholimon cephalotes, commonly known as the mountain flax or alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high altitudes and limited rainfall. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the unique biodiversity of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon cephalotes was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly seen in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been introduced to parts of California and other western United States regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on native plant communities."
