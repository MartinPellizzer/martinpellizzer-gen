    "intro": "Antennaria anacleta, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sun-exposed areas. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Antennaria anacleta is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
