    "intro": "Anguria trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces elongated, cucurbitaceous fruits that are typically green and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant features palmate leaves with three lobes, which are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insects for pollination. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cucumber varieties."
