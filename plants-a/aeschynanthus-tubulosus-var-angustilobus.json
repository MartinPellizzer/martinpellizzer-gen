    "intro": "Aeschynanthus tubulosus var. angustilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed wax plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a trailing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers. The flowers typically range in color from orange to red and are borne in dense, hanging inflorescences. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
