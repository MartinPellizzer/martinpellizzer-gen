It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
