    "intro": "Asteriscus confusus, commonly known as the fuzzy aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asteriscus confusus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
