    "intro": "Archibaccharis prorepens, commonly known as the creeping sandbar willow, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. This species is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
