    "intro": "Andropogon scandens, commonly known as eastern wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or waterlogged soils. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses."
