    "intro": "Aster yosemitanus, commonly known as the Yosemite aster, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
