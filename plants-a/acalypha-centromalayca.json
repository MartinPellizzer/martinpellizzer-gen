    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha centromalayca is primarily native to the Malay Peninsula, including parts of southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid tropical climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. Its native distribution is restricted to this geographic region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha centromalayca was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly used in landscaping and as a houseplant because of its vibrant leaf colors and ease of care. This species has been cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive. However, it is generally considered a low-maintenance plant with minimal ecological impact in controlled environments."
