    "intro": "Aydendron laurel, commonly known as the sacred laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often aromatic and have a slight waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Aydendron laurel is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense, compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens and natural habitats."
