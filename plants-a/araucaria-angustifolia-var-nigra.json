    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. nigra, commonly known as the black southern pine, is a variant of the Brazilian pine that exhibits distinctive dark foliage. This evergreen conifer is native to the southern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and are typically a deep green color, which can darken to almost black under certain conditions. The tree produces coniferous cones, and its growth habit is characterized by a tall, slender trunk with a narrow, conical crown. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique appearance."
