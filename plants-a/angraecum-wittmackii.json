    "intro": "Angraecum wittmackii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to its environment with specialized structures for capturing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
