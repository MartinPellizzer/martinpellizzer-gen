    "intro": "Antiphytum humilis, commonly known as the lowly antiphytum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts well to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
