    "intro": "Arabis owaihiensis, commonly known as the O'ahu rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the island of O'ahu in Hawaii. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
