    "intro": "Aegilops ovata subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic wild barley, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bristle-like awns. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of domesticated barley."
