    "intro": "Anastraphia northropiana, commonly known as the Northrop's anastraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a spreading habit that allows it to thrive in shaded undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Anastraphia northropiana is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks across its native range."
