    "intro": "Asplenium affine f. tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a glossy surface, with a distinctive, feathery structure. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
