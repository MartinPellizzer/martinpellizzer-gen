It features a distinctive purple-tinged, arrow-shaped leaf that often has a spotted or mottled appearance. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, and it blooms during the warmer months. Arum variolatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
