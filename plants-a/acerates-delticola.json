    "intro": "Acerates delticola, commonly known as the coastal maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that attract birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Acerates delticola plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
