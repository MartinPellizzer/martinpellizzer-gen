It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the plant. Arundinella confinis typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
