    "intro": "Abildgaardia wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of around 5 meters, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation. Its unique ecological role and ornamental value make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia wombaliensis is primarily native to the island of Womboli in the Bismarck Archipelago, part of Papua New Guinea. This rare plant is found in specific microhabitats within the tropical rainforests of the region. It thrives in the humid and shaded undergrowth, often near water sources. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique flora from threats such as deforestation and climate change.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia wombaliensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers."
