    "intro": "Atalanthus arboreus, commonly known as the tree morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
