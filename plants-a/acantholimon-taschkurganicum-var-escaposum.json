    "intro": "Acantholimon taschkurganicum var. escaposum, commonly known as the alpine spurgeflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species with showy, often colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with flowering stems that are typically unbranched and bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the edges of deserts and in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its limited distribution reflects its specific ecological requirements and habitat preferences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon taschkurganicum var. escaposum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and requires minimal water once established. This plant is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing along slopes or in open grasslands. Its introduction has been primarily associated with ecological restoration projects and ornamental horticulture. Due to its hardy nature, it has shown potential for stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
