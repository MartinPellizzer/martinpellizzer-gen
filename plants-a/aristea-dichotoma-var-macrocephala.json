    "intro": "Aristea dichotoma var. macrocephala, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that resemble hair. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, especially in coastal landscapes. The variety 'macrocephala' stands out due to its larger, more pronounced flower heads compared to the typical form of Aristea dichotoma."
