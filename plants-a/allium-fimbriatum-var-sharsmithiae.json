    "intro": "Allium fimbriatum var. sharsmithiae, commonly known as the Sharsmith's onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often covered in a fibrous sheath, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
