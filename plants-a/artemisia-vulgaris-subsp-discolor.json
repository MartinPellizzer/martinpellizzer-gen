    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. discolor, commonly known as grey artemisia, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a strong, camphor-like aroma. This subspecies is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
