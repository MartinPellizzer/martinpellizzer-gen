It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its sharp, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, green, cucumber-like fruits. The fruit develops a strong, unpleasant odor when ripe, which is a key feature of the species. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
