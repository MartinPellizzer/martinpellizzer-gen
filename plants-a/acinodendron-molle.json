It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Acinodendron molle is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks.",
