    "intro": "Aeonium pseudourbicum, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the growing season. Aeonium pseudourbicum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
