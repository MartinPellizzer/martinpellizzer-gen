    "intro": "Aira latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf airgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tip, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
