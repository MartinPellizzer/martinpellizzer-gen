    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea var. typica, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is a common component of desert and sagebrush ecosystems."
