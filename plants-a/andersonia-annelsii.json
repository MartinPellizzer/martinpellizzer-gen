    "intro": "Andersonia annelsii, commonly known as the coastal bell heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
