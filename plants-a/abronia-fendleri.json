It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Baja California. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including crevices in limestone and sandstone. It is commonly found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia fendleri was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, growing in rocky soils and crevices. This species is known for its small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in association with other desert flora, such as cacti and shrubs. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive plant species."
