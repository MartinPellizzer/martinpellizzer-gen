    "intro": "Aster amnicola, commonly known as the Amnicola aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
