    "intro": "Arundo piscatoria, commonly known as water reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands along riverbanks and pond edges. The plant has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a fibrous, hollow stem that is often used in basket-making. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. Arundo piscatoria plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
