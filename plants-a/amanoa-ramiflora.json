    "intro": "Amanoa ramiflora, commonly known as the branching amanoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
