It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with glandular, sticky hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
