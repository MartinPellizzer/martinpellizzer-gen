It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum marschallianum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
