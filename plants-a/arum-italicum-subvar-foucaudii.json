    "intro": "Arum italicum subvar. foucaudii, commonly known as the Sicilian arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often glossy and deep green, with a striking red or purple spathe that encloses the spadix. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
