    "intro": "Asperula euryphylla var. octophylla, commonly known as the eight-leaf asperula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in clusters of eight, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
