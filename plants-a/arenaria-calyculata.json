    "intro": "Arenaria calyculata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry meadows. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Arenaria calyculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
