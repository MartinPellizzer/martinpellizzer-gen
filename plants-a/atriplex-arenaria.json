    "intro": "Atriplex arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. Atriplex arenaria is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
