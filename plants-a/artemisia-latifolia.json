    "intro": "Artemisia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, bitter scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia latifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural insect repellents due to its chemical compounds."
