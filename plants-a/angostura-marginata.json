    "intro": "Angostura marginata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, aiding in stabilization and oxygen absorption. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps reduce salt absorption from the humid environment. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed. This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
