    "intro": "Apinus cembra, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of soft, white hairs. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and purity."
