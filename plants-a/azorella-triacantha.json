    "intro": "Azorella triacantha, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, spiny leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold, and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the short growing season, typically in late summer. Its unique morphology allows it to retain moisture and withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. Azorella triacantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its alpine habitat."
