    "intro": "Arbutus occidentalis var. villosa, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The Pacific madrone is also known for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
