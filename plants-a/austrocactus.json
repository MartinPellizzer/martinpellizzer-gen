    "intro": "Austrocactus, commonly known as the South American cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and often have a globular or cylindrical shape. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and low water availability. Austrocactus species are generally slow-growing and can store water in their thick, fleshy stems. Many species are prized for their unique appearance and are cultivated as ornamental plants."
