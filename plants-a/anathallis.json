    "intro": "Anathallis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. Anathallis typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments, thriving in shaded, moist conditions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
