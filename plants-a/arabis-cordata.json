    "intro": "Arabis cordata, commonly known as heartleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Arabis cordata is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
