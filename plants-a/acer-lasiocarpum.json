    "intro": "Acer lasiocarpum, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive downy texture. The tree produces small, red to orange-red samaras, which are its characteristic winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer lasiocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and seasonal color changes.",
