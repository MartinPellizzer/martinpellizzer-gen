    "intro": "Alliaria turczaninowii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or purple flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces round, three-lobed fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it identifiable and distinguishable from other members of its family."
