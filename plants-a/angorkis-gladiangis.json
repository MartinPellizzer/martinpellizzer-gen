It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
