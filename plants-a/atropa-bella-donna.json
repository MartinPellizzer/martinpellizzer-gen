    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a toxic perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and bell-shaped, purple-black berries. The plant contains potent alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which make it highly poisonous. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, and it thrives in woodland areas and disturbed soils. Despite its toxicity, it has historically been used in medicine and as a tool in espionage due to its powerful effects on the nervous system."
