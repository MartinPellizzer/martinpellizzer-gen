    "intro": "Aesculus glabra var. glabra, commonly known as the American buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which consist of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces showy, spiny clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits that mature to a chestnut-like appearance. The bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive, shallow fissuring pattern. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wooded areas."
