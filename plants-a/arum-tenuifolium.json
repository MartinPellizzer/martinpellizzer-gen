It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and dramatic, spadix-like inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The narrow-leaf arum is also a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance."
