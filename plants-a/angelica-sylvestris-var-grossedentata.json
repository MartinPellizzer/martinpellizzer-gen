    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris var. grossedentata, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often covered with coarse hairs and reddish spots. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and can reach several feet in diameter. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, making it potentially harmful to the skin when exposed to sunlight."
