    "intro": "Arcterica, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, deciduous leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, which helps insulate the plant against freezing temperatures. Arcterica plays an important role in the ecosystems of its habitat, providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species."
