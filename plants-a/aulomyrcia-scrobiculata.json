It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
