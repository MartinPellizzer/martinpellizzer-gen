    "intro": "Aniba tessmannii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It has opposite, simple, and usually elliptic or ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. The tree's aromatic leaves and wood have also been used in traditional medicine and craftsmanship."
