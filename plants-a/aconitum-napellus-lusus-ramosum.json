    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus ramosum, commonly known as the ramose monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, upright clusters. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
