It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically green or yellowish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and capable of rapid vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread quickly in suitable environments. Arundinaria confusa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit."
