    "intro": "Ageratina chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in the humid forests of Chiapas, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ageratina chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
