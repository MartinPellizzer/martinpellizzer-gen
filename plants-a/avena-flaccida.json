    "intro": "Avena flaccida, commonly known as the drooping oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It features slender, erect stems that often bend or droop under the weight of its inflorescence. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, with small, delicate flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Avena flaccida is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wet meadows."
