    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. vestita, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, hardy ground cover."
