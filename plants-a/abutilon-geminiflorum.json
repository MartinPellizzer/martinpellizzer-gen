    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon geminiflorum is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically California, and parts of Baja California, Mexico. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It is also known to occur in some inland areas with similar environmental conditions. Abutilon geminiflorum is an important component of the coastal flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon geminiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Texas, and parts of the Mediterranean. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. It has been introduced to various parts of the world as a garden plant and for erosion control. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species."
