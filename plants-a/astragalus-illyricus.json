    "intro": "Astragalus illyricus, commonly known as the Illyrian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus illyricus is often found in grasslands and scrublands, contributing to soil stabilization and supporting local biodiversity."
