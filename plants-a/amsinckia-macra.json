    "intro": "Amsinckia macra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are showy, with pale yellow to orange petals and are borne on tall, slender stems. Amsinckia macra is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
