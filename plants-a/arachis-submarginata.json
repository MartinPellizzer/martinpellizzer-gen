    "intro": "Arachis submarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or the wild peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, similar to cultivated peanuts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in plant breeding and conservation efforts."
