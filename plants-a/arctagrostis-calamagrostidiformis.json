    "intro": "Arctagrostis calamagrostidiformis, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
