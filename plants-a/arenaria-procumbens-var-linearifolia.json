    "intro": "Arenaria procumbens var. linearifolia, commonly known as sand pink or creeping sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Small pink or white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant is often found in dunes, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas, contributing to stabilizing sandy habitats."
