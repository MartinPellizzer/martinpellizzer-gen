    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
