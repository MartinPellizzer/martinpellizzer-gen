    "intro": "Archivea kewensis, commonly known as the Kew Archangel, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is known for its unique, pendulous inflorescence. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
