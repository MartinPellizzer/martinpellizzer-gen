    "intro": "Aurinia uechtritziana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aurinia uechtritziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
