It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to cream-colored flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
