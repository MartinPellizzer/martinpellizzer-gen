    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer capillipes var. fujisanense is primarily native to the Japanese Alps, specifically the mountainous regions of central Japan, including the vicinity of Mount Fuji. This variety is found in the subalpine and alpine zones where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on slopes and ridges. The plant is particularly associated with the areas around the southern slopes of Mount Fuji and other high-altitude regions in Honshu. Its limited distribution makes it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer capillipes var. fujisanense was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in temperate regions. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its vibrant autumn colors, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping. It has been introduced to parts of North America, where it is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
