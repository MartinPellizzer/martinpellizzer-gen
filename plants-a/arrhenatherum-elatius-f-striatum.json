    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius f. striatum, commonly known as the stripe grass or striped meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that often display a distinctive striped pattern on the blade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, ditches, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
