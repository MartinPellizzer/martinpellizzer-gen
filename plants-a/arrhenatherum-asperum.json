    "intro": "Arrhenatherum asperum, commonly known as rough false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its inflorescence is a dense, cylindrical spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
