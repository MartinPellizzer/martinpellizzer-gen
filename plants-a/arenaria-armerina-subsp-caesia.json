    "intro": "Arenaria armerina subsp. caesia, commonly known as the blue sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and floral traits."
