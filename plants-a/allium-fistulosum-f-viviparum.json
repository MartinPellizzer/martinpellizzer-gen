    "intro": "Allium fistulosum f. viviparum, commonly known as the garlic chive or Chinese chive, is a variant of the common garlic chive that exhibits vivipary, a rare reproductive trait where the seedlings develop while still attached to the parent plant. This plant is a perennial herb native to Asia, characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and bulbs. The viviparous nature of this variety makes it unique among allium species, as it can produce viable seedlings without the need for traditional seed germination."
