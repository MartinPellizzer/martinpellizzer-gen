    "intro": "Amphibolis zosterifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize the ecosystem. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in spikes. Amphibolis zosterifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, including high salt levels and strong winds."
