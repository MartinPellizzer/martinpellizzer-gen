    "intro": "Antidesma riparium subsp. ramosum, commonly known as the river antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and swamps, and is adapted to moist, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
