It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. Adenophora pereskiifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates.",
