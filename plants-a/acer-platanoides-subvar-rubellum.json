It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage, which turns vibrant shades of crimson and orange in the fall. The tree has a broad, spreading crown with elongated, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm long. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.",
