    "intro": "Avena macrocalycina, commonly known as the large calyx oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, elongated bracts that give the plant its common name. Avena macrocalycina is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
