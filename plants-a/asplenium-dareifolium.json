It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium dareifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
