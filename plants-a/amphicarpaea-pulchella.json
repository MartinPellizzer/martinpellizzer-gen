    "intro": "Amphicarpaea pulchella, commonly known as the pretty false flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, producing two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its roots form nodules that host nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
