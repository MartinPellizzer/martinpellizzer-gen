    "intro": "Antennaria carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian filaree, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a dense mat of stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, forming a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Antennaria carpatica is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
