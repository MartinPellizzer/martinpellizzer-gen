    "intro": "Astragalus substipitatus, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, linear leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus substipitatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
