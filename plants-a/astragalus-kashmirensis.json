    "intro": "Astragalus kashmirensis, commonly known as Kashmir milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
