It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous seeds. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
