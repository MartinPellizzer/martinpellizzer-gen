    "intro": "Athyrium viviparum, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
