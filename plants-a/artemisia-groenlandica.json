    "intro": "Artemisia groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland wormwood, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, serrated leaves that release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. This plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its small yellow flowers appear in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support. Artemisia groenlandica is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
