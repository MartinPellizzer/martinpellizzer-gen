    "intro": "Arachniodes parasimplicior, commonly known as the slender bamboo fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the growing season."
