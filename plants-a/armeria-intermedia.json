    "intro": "Armeria intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to gardens and naturalized areas."
