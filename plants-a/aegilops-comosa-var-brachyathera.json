    "intro": "Aegilops comosa var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short-haired wild wheat, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. Its botanical features make it a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement due to its potential for stress tolerance and disease resistance. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments."
