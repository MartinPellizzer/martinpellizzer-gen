    "intro": "Asarum europaeum, commonly known as European wild ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tuberous root system and heart-shaped, reddish-purple leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine."
