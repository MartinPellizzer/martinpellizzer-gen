    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, open habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly larger size and more robust growth habit."
