It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
