    "intro": "Arbutus ovata, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and coastal regions of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and broad, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries. Arbutus ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. Its unique botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
