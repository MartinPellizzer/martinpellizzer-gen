    "intro": "Aster aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's aster, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has hairy leaves and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
