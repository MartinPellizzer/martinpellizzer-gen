    "intro": "Aulomyrcia billardiana, commonly known as the Brazilian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark, spherical berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
