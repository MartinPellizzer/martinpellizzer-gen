    "intro": "Androsace villosa subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric tufted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and southern Russia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with bright green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
