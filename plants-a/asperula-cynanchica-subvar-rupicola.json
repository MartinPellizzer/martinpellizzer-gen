    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica subvar. rupicola, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded, moist environments."
