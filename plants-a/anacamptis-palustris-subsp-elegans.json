    "intro": "Anacamptis palustris subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing a dense spike of pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fen environments."
