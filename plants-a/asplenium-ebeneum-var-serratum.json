It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in indoor and garden settings."
