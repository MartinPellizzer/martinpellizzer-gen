    "intro": "Amygdalus bilinica, commonly known as the two-colored almond. It is a species of shrub native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its small, oval leaves and pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, stone fruits with a thin skin and a sweet, nutty flavor. It is closely related to the common almond (Prunus dulcis) and shares similar botanical features. However, it is less commonly cultivated due to its smaller size and lower fruit yield compared to other almond species."
