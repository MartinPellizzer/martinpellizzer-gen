    "intro": "Aethionema leptocarpium, commonly known as the narrow-fruit rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Aethionema leptocarpium is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
