    "intro": "Asclepias standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Asclepias standleyi plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
