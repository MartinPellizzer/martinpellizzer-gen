    "intro": "Acaena tomentella, commonly known as the woolly burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant belongs to the family Rosaceae and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology includes stiff, thorn-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Acaena tomentella plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tomentella is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as shrublands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland regions, often in areas with low rainfall. Acaena tomentella is an important component of the native flora and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tomentella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
