    "intro": "Allium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is edible and has a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a useful plant in culinary applications. Allium serrulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
