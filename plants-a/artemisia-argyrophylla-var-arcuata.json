It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its leaves are aromatic and contain volatile oils, contributing to its medicinal and ecological significance.
