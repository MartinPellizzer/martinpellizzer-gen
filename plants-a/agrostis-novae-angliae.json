It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
