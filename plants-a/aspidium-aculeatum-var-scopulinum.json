    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. scopulinum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often covered with small, prickly spines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of this fern make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
