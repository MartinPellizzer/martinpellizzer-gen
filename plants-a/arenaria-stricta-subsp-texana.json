    "intro": "Arenaria stricta subsp. texana, commonly known as Texas sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open plains, and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
