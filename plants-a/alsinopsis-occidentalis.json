    "intro": "Alsinopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems. Alsinopsis occidentalis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
