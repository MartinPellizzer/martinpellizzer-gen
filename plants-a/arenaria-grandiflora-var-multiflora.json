    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces numerous tiny, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
