    "intro": "Angraecum distichum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by the hawkmoth, with nectar-rich spurs that match the moth's long proboscis. Due to its unique features and conservation status, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
