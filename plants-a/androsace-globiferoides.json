    "intro": "Androsace globiferoides, commonly known as the globular androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, cushion-like growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in some areas."
