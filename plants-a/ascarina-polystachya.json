    "intro": "Ascarina polystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sycamore, is a member of the Araucariaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, clustered cones. The plant has a rugged, fibrous bark that becomes fissured with age, and its roots are often extensive, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. Ascarina polystachya plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and food for various native species."
