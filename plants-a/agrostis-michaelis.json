It is characterized by its low-growing habit, narrow leaves, and dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. Agrostis michaelis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
