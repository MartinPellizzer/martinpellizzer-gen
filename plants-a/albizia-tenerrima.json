    "intro": "Albizia tenerrima, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can help in soil stabilization, making it useful in reforestation efforts. Albizia tenerrima is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
