    "intro": "Astragalus xanthinus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
