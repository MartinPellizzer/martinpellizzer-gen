    "intro": "Acacia leiophylla, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to coastal conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Acacia leiophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and inland dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. Acacia leiophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leiophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to grow in poor soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts on local ecosystems."
