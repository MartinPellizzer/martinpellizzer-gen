    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tiubae is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is commonly found in humid lowland areas and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in warm, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native distribution.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tiubae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ornamental value have contributed to its spread in these regions."
