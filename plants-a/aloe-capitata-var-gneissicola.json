    "intro": "Aloe capitata var. gneissicola, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which are typical of the Aloe genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
