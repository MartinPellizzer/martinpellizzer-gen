    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rufinerve is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This species thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rufinerve was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become a weed in some regions, particularly in agricultural areas. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and crop lands."
