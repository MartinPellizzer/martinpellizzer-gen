    "intro": "Astragalus sagitticarpus, commonly known as the arrowhead milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, arrow-shaped seed pods that are typically brown or reddish in hue. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. Astragalus sagitticarpus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils in arid regions."
