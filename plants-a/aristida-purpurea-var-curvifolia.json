It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a distinctive purple tinge along the edges.
