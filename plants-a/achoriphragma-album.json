    "intro": "Achoriphragma album, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Achoriphragma album is often found in rocky areas and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
