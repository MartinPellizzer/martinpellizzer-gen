It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its traditional medicinal uses, though it is also considered rare and protected in many regions."
