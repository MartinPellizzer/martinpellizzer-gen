It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hollow stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are white with a single red or purple flower at the center, which attracts pollinators like butterflies and bees. Anaxeton is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
