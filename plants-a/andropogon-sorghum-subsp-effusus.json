    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subsp. effusus, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This species typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle structure. Eastern gamagrass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
