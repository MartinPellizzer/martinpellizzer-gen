It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with forest understories and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is also known to occur in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fruticosa var. villosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and rapid growth. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
