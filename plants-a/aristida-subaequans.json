    "intro": "Aristida subaequans, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Aristida subaequans is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
