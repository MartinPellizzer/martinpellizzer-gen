    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a glandular, sticky coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or gravelly areas. Its adaptations make it a resilient species in harsh, semi-arid habitats."
