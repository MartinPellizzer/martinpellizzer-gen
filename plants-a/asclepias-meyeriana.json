    "intro": "Asclepias meyeriana, commonly known as Meyer's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Meyer's milkweed is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
