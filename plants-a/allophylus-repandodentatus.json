It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often spiny leaves, which are usually elliptical to ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in woodland and savanna habitats."
