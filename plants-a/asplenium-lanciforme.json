    "intro": "Asplenium lanciforme, commonly known as the lance fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinct, linear appearance, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
