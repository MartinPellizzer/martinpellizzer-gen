    "intro": "Aichryson subvillosum, commonly known as the silver woolly aichryson, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
