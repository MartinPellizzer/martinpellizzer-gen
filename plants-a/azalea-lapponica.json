It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, where it forms part of the alpine flora.
