    "intro": "Aloe nitida var. major, commonly known as the giant tree aloe, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Despite its size, it is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardens."
