    "intro": "Ameletia elatinoides, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Ameletia elatinoides is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal habitats."
