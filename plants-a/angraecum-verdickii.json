    "intro": "Angraecum verdickii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
