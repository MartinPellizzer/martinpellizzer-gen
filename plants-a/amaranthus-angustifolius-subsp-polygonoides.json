It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping. The seeds are edible and have been used historically by indigenous peoples for food and ceremonial purposes."
