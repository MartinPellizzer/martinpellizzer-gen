It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves and a massive, spadix-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are typically green or white, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
