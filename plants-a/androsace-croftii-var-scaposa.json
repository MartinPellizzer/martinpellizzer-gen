    "intro": "Androsace croftii var. scaposa, commonly known as the Scapose Androsace, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically grown in rock gardens or as a container plant in cooler climates."
