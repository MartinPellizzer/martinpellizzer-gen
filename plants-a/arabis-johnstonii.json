    "intro": "Arabis johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to the harsh, cold environments of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
