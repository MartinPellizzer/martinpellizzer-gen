    "intro": "Arabis suffrutescens var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features basal rosettes of dark green, glossy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
