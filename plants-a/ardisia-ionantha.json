It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faint fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Ardisia ionantha thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
