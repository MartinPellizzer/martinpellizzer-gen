It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
