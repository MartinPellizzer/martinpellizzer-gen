It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
