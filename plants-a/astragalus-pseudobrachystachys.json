    "intro": "Astragalus pseudobrachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are characteristic of the legume family. Its leaves are compound, with pairs of oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus pseudobrachystachys is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
