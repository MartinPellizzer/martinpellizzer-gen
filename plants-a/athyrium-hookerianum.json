    "intro": "Athyrium hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales, and the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium hookerianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
