The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Alpinia grandiceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
