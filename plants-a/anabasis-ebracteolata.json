    "intro": "Anabasis ebracteolata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Anabasis ebracteolata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in sandy habitats."
