    "intro": "Aegilops subulata, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Aegilops subulata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to wild relative species of wheat."
