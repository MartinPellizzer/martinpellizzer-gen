It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive vicia-like leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
