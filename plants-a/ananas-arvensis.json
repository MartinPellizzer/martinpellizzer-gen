    "intro": "Ananas arvensis, commonly known as the field pineapple, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spadix of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. While not commonly cultivated for food, it is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
