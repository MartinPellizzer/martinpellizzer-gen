    "intro": "Agoseris vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in disturbed or volcanic soils. Its yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, elongated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Agoseris vulcanica is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments, showcasing resilience typical of plants in volcanic ecosystems."
