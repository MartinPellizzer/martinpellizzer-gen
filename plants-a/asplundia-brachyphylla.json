    "intro": "Asplundia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved asplundia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many flowering plants characterized by their spadix and spathe structures. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Asplundia brachyphylla is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks."
