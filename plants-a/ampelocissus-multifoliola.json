It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in traditional medicine. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens."
