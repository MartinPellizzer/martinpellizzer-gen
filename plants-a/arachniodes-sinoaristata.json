    "intro": "Arachniodes sinoaristata, commonly known as the Chinese nettle fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a finely divided, almost lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its fronds are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Arachniodes sinoaristata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
