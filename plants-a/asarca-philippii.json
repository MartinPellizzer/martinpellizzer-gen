    "intro": "Asarca philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its small, white to pale purple flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. Asarca philippii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
