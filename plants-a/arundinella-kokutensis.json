    "intro": "Arundinella kokutensis, commonly known as the Kokut\u00e9 bamboo, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow and long, often with a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Arundinella kokutensis is valued for its strong, flexible stalks, which have been traditionally used in basket-making and construction."
