    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. patulum, commonly known as the cushion alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
