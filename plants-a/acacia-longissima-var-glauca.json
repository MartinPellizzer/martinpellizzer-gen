    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longissima var. glauca is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is commonly found in regions such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This variety thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can withstand periods of drought. The plant is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longissima var. glauca was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has also been introduced to parts of southern Europe and the western United States as a landscape plant. The introduction of this variety has led to its establishment in some areas outside its native range. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. However, its spread is generally limited by its preference for specific soil types and climate."
