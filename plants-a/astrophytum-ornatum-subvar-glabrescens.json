    "intro": "Astrophytum ornatum subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-topped astrophytum, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are covered in areoles with clusters of white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
