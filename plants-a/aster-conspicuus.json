It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, prairies, and along stream banks, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Aster conspicuus is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
