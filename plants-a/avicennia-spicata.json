    "intro": "Avicennia spicata, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salt concentrations. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss and salt accumulation. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. Avicennia spicata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
