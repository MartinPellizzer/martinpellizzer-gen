    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. pilosissima, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it attaches to the roots of other plants. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is relatively rare and often overlooked in natural ecosystems."
