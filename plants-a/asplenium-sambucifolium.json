    "intro": "Asplenium sambucifolium, commonly known as the sambucus-leaved spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Asplenium sambucifolium is a relatively uncommon species, with a limited geographic distribution."
