It features basal leaves that are grass-like and clustered at the base, with a rosette structure. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild onion flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
