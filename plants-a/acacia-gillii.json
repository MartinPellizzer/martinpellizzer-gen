    "intro": "Acacia gillii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are small, phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. Acacia gillii is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gillii is primarily native to South Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within the state. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia gillii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gillii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate saline conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and the United States, as an ornamental species. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems."
