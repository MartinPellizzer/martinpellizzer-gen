    "intro": "Ammi apiifolium, commonly known as the common cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its appearance, it is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family."
