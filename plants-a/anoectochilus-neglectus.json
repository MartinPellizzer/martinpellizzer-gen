    "intro": "Anoectochilus neglectus, commonly known as the neglected slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and typically produces dark green, velvety leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. Anoectochilus neglectus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
