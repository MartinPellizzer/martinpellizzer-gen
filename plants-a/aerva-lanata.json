    "intro": "Aerva lanata, commonly known as Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Aerva lanata is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
