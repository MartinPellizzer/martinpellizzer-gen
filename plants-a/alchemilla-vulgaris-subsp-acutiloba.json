    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are sharply lobed, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
