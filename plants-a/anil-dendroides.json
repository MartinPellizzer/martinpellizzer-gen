    "intro": "Anil dendroides, commonly known as the silky tree or silky antelope tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spreading crown and soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Anil dendroides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
