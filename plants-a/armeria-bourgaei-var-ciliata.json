    "intro": "Armeria bourgaei var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliate thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves with ciliate (fringed) margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray and coastal conditions."
