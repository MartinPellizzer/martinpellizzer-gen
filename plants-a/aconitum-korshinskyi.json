    "intro": "Aconitum korshinskyi, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers arranged in a tall spire, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of a fern. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
