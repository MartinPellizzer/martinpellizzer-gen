    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa lorentzii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts who admired its distinctive foliage. Despite its ornamental value, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various natural habitats across the North Island. The plant's ability to thrive in a range of soil types and climates has contributed to its successful establishment. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
