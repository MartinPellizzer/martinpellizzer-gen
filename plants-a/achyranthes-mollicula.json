    "intro": "Achyranthes mollicula, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.",
