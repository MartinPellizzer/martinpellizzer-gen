It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
