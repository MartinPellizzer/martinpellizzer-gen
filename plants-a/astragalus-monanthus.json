    "intro": "Astragalus monanthus, commonly known as the single-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus monanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native range."
