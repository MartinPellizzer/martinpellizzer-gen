    "intro": "Antirrhinum laxiflorum, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its delicate appearance and early blooming period make it a notable wildflower in its native range."
