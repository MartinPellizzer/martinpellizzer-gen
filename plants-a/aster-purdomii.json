    "intro": "Aster purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
