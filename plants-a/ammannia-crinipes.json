    "intro": "Ammannia crinipes, commonly known as the water spinach or river spinach, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and slender, branching stems that often grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, slightly sweet flavor. Ammannia crinipes is also valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a useful plant for soil stabilization in wetland areas."
