    "intro": "Arachnorchis hoffmanii subsp. graniticola, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Australia. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the orchid family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
