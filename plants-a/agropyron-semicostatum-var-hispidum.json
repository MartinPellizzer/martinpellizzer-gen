    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hispid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
