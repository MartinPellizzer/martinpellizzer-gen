    "intro": "Alchemilla cavillieri, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a dense mat of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla cavillieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
