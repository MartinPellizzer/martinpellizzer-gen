    "intro": "Alnus communis, commonly known as the common alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its simple, alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellowish-green in color. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Alnus communis is known for its ability to thrive in wet, poorly drained soils, often found near streams and rivers."
