    "intro": "Athyrium crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
