    "intro": "Artocarpus maximus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The tree produces large, round fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature, though they can be eaten at various stages of development. Its leaves are large, alternate, and palmately lobed, providing shade and contributing to the tree's ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is strong and durable, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
