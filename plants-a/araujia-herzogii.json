It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces fruit that splits open to reveal bright red seeds. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates."
