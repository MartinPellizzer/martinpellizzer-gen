    "intro": "Asterocephalus setifer, commonly known as the feather-tipped starhead, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its inflorescence consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Asterocephalus setifer is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources."
