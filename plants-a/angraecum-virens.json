    "intro": "Angraecum virens, commonly known as the green angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences and striking greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth *Xanthopetes praedatus*, a relationship that evolved over millions of years. Angraecum virens is noted for its resilience and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
