    "intro": "Aruba cedron, commonly known as *Cedrela odorata*, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Aruba cedron is also cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
