    "intro": "Aegilops comosa f. subventricosa, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
