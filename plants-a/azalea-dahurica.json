    "intro": "Azalea dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Azalea dahurica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
