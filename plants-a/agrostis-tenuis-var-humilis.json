    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. humilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
