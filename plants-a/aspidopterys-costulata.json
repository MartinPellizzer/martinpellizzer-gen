    "intro": "Aspidopterys costulata, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in rainforests and humid woodlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Aspidopterys costulata is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
