    "intro": "Acacia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals. Acacia siamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia siamensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks where it can receive ample sunlight. Its distribution is also extended to parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as India and Bangladesh. Acacia siamensis plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia siamensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has also been introduced for ornamental purposes in some parts of the world. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
