    "intro": "Anil microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited anil, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it has hairy stems that help reduce water loss. Anil microcarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with moderate to high rainfall."
