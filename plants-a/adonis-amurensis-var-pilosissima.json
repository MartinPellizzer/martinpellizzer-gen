    "intro": "Adonis amurensis var. pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy Adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern regions of Russia and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered with fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.",
