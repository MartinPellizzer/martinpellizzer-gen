It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and showy, often white or yellowish inflorescences. The plants are typically found in dry, rocky habitats and are native to southern Europe and North Africa. Asphodeline species are perennial, with some varieties being used in ornamental gardening for their striking appearance. They have a fibrous root system and are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
