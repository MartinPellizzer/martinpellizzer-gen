    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 tosaense, commonly known as the Tosa spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure between 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The botanical interest in this species lies in its hybrid origin and its role in the study of fern genetics and evolution."
