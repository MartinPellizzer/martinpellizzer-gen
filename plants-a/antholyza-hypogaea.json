    "intro": "Antholyza hypogaea, commonly known as the ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers that appear in the spring. The plant spreads primarily through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate garden beds. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and sage."
