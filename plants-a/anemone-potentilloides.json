    "intro": "Anemone potentilloides, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. The plant is often found in clusters, with a short, thick rhizome that supports its growth and propagation."
