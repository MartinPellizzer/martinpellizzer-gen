    "intro": "Aphyllon uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower leafless plant, is a unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a single flower emerging from its stem. The plant is typically found in rocky or acidic soil environments, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, and they bloom during the summer months. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
