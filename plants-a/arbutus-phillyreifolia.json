    "intro": "Arbutus phillyreifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet berries. It thrives in coastal climates with well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Arbutus phillyreifolia plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
