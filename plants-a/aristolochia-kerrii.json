    "intro": "Aristolochia kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a rapid growth habit. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation without proper knowledge."
