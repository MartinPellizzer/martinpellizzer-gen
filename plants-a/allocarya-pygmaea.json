    "intro": "Allocarya pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf chenopod, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Allocarya pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
