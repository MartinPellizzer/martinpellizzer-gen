    "intro": "Asperula capillacea, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a compact, carpet-like pattern, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Asperula capillacea is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
