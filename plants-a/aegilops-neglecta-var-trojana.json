    "intro": "Aegilops neglecta var. trojana, commonly known as the Trojana wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
