    "intro": "Antennaria densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically forms a mat of rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white or grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Antennaria densifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
