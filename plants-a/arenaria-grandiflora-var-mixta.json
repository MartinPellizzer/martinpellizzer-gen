    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. mixta, commonly known as the mixed stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
