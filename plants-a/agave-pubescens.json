    "intro": "Agave pubescens, commonly known as the wooly agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a rosette shape, with leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 feet. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave pubescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
