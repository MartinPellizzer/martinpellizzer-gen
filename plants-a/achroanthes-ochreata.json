    "intro": "Achroanthes ochreata, commonly known as the ochre bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
