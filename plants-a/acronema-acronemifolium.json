    "intro": "Acronema acronemifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronema, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.",
