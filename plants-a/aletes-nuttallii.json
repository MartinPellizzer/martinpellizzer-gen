    "intro": "Aletes nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's aletes, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the genus Aletes within the family Polygonaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aletes nuttallii is considered a vulnerable species."
