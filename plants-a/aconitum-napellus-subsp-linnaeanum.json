It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
