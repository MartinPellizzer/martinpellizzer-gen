    "intro": "Achyropsis fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Achyropsis fruticulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",
