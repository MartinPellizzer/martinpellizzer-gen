It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
