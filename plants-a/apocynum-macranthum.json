    "intro": "Apocynum macranthum, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture. Apocynum macranthum plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
