    "intro": "Alsine stellata, commonly known as starweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant has small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Alsine stellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
