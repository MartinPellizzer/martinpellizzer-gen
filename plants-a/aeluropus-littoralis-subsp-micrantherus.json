    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis subsp. micrantherus, commonly known as the coastal sand couch, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy soils along shorelines and is an important component of coastal vegetation. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it a key species in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
