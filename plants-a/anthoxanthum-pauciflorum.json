    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered anthoxanthum, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually glaucous in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Anthoxanthum pauciflorum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
