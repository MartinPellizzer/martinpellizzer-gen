    "intro": "Audibertia polystachya, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing small, round seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
