It is characterized by its long, slender spurs that can extend up to 15 centimeters, a feature that aids in pollination by specialized lepidopteran insects. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
