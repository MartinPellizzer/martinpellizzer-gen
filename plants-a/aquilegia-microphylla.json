    "intro": "Aquilegia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf garden bell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces compound leaves with lobed foliage, and its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems. Aquilegia microphylla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
