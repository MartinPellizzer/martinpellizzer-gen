    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha japonica is primarily native to East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and parts of China. It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks in these regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with temperate climates. It is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha japonica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there during the 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its vibrant leaves. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a challenge for ecological management. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread while minimizing harm to the environment."
