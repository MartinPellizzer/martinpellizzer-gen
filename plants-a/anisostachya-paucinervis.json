It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
