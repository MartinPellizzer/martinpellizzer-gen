    "intro": "Agropyron caninum subsp. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in panicles, and its flowers are small and wind-pollinated. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
