It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Adonis coriacea is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.",
