It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, sometimes unpleasant taste.
