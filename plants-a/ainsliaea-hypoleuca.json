    "intro": "Ainsliaea hypoleuca, commonly known as the white ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in cymes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ainsliaea hypoleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
