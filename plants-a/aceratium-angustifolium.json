    "intro": "Aceratium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aceratium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
