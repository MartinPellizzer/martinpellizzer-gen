    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 wojaense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 wojaense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
