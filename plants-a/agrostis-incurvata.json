    "intro": "Agrostis incurvata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, spreading stems with small, narrow leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. Its flowers are spike-like and produce small, wind-pollinated seeds. Agrostis incurvata is valued for its fine texture and is commonly used in turfgrass and ornamental landscaping."
