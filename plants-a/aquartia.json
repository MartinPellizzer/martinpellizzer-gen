    "intro": "Aquartia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Aquartia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies."
