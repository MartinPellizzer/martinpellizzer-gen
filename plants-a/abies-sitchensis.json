    "intro": "Abies sitchensis, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are flat, dark green, and have a waxy coating, while the cones are typically pendulous and reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in cold, boreal climates and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. This species is valued for its timber and is also an important component of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sitchensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Alaska, western Canada, and the Aleutian Islands. It thrives in temperate rainforests where it receives ample moisture and cool temperatures. This species is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with the Pacific Northwest, where it grows in mountainous and subalpine zones. Its native range extends from British Columbia to the southern parts of Alaska.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sitchensis was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, as an ornamental and timber species. It is often planted in urban and suburban landscapes due to its attractive appearance and cold hardiness. The introduction has led to its establishment in various regions, sometimes beyond its intended planting areas. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. However, its spread can sometimes raise concerns regarding ecological impact in non-native environments."
