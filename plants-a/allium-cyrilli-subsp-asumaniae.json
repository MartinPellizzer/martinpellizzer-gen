    "intro": "Allium cyrilli subsp. asumaniae, commonly known as the Aso Mountain garlic, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes a wide variety of bulbous plants commonly referred to as garlic or onions. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in umbels, typical of many allium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
