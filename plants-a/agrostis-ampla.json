    "intro": "Agrostis ampla, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Agrostis ampla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
