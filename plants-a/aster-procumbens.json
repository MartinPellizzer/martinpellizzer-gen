    "intro": "Aster procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster procumbens thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
