It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the spadix produces both male and female flowers. Arisaema brevispathum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and unusual flowering structure."
