    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris var. quartinianus, commonly known as the Quartinian sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland sites."
