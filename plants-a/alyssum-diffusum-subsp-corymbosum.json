    "intro": "Alyssum diffusum subsp. corymbosum, commonly known as clustered alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has soft, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum diffusum subsp. corymbosum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
