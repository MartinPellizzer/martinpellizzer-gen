    "intro": "Alsine uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to sandy and coastal regions. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Alsine uniflora is valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
