    "intro": "Aleuritopteris kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris kuhnii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
