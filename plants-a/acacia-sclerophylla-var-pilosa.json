    "intro": "Acacia sclerophylla var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and yellow flowers that appear in cylindrical spikes. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sclerophylla var. pilosa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sclerophylla var. pilosa was mainly introduced to specific regions of Australia, particularly in South Australia and parts of Western Australia. It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its dense, feathery foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it can establish quickly. It has become naturalized in some areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in certain regions."
