    "intro": "Alfredia stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alfredia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Due to habitat loss, Alfredia stenolepis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
