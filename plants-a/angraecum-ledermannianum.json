    "intro": "Angraecum ledermannianum, commonly known as the Ledermann's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with numerous small, star-shaped flowers, which are adapted for pollination by moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
