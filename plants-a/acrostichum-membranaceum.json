    "intro": "Acrostichum membranaceum, commonly known as the giant reed or giant bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and not showy. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands in marshes and along waterways. This species is adapted to wet conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats.",
