    "intro": "Axiniphyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly axiniphyllum, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in a fine, woolly texture, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
