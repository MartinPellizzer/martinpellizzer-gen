    "intro": "Aerangis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aerangis hildebrandtii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
