    "intro": "Aconitum bulleyanum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance. Aconitum bulleyanum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
