It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and basal leaves that are palmately lobed with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
