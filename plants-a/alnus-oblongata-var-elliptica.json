    "intro": "Alnus oblongata var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glandular beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the alder genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
