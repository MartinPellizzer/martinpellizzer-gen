    "intro": "Acalypha echinus, commonly known as the spiked hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyx that surrounds its showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and often a reddish or purple underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha echinus is primarily native to Kenya and Tanzania. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in East Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha echinus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first brought there in the late 19th century by horticulturists who admired its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying landscapes and posing ecological risks."
