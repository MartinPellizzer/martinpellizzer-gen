    "intro": "Acer italum var. acutilobum, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201312 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil types.",
