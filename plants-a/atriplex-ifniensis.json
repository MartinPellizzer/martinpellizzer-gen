    "intro": "Atriplex ifniensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands saltbush, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, featuring a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It thrives in saline and rocky soils, making it well-suited to coastal and inland desert environments. Atriplex ifniensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
