    "intro": "Alyssum murale var. petaloides, commonly known as the fringed alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are linear to lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
