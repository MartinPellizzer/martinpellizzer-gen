    "intro": "Asplenium auritum f. diversifolium, commonly known as the Variegated\u8033\u8568, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique pattern of light and dark green variegation. The fronds are often covered in small, scale-like structures, which help in reducing water loss. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
