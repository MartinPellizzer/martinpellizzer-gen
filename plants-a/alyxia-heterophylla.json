    "intro": "Alyxia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant features alternate leaves that vary in shape and size, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary or terminal clusters. Alyxia heterophylla produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife."
