It typically grows in moist meadows and wetlands, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
