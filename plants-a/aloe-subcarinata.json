It features upright, branching stems with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Aloe subcarinata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
