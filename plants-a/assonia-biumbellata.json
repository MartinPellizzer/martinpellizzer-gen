    "intro": "Assonia biumbellata, commonly known as the two-winged milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is typical of the family. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Assonia biumbellata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments."
