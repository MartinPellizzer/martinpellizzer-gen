    "intro": "Allocasuarina grampiana, commonly known as the Grampian she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to the south-eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Allocasuarina grampiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
