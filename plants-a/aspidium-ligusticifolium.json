It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The botanical characteristics of Aspidium ligusticifolium make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
