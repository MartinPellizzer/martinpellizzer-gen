    "intro": "Ammi majus var. tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf cowbane, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
