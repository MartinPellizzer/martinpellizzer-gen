    "intro": "Agathis australis, commonly known as the kauri tree, is a large evergreen conifer native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The tree can grow up to 50 meters in height and has a lifespan that can exceed 1,000 years. Its wood is dense, durable, and highly valued for its strength and workability. The kauri also produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
