    "intro": "Aptosimum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along streambanks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Aptosimum pumilum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
