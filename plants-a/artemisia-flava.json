    "intro": "Artemisia flava, commonly known as yellow tansy, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its volatile oils, which give it a distinctive scent, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and insect-repelling properties. Artemisia flava plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
