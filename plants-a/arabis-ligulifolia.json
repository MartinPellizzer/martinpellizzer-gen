    "intro": "Arabis ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, and its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hair. Arabis ligulifolia is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
