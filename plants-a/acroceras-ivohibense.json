    "intro": "Acroceras ivohibense, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains poorly understood.",
