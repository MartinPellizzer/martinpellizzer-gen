    "intro": "Amyema finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroe Islands ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species endemic to the Faroe Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate labellum and spurred structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amyema finisterrae is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest."
