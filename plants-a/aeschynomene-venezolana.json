It is native to South America, particularly Venezuela, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, dark seeds. Aeschynomene venezolana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions. It is also valued for its potential as a forage crop and for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
