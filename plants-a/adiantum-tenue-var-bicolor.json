    "intro": "Adiantum tenue var. bicolor, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically gray-green with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-brown sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
