    "intro": "Andropogon semisagittatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and erosion control capabilities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
