    "intro": "Aeschynanthus tricolor, commonly known as the three-color ivy or tri-color ivy, is a species of flowering plant native to western Africa. It is a trailing plant with dense, velvety foliage that displays a striking combination of green, red, and white on its leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus tricolor is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
