    "intro": "Aechmea porteoides, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically green with red or purple hues along the edges, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Aechmea porteoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
