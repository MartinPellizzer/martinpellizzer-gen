    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis var. genuinus, commonly known as the Greek love grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
