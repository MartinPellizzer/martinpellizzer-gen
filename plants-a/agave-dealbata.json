It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have sharp, spiny tips. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
