    "intro": "Anatropanthus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean anatropanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland rainforests. It has a woody stem and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
