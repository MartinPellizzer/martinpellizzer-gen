    "intro": "Asplenium dissimile, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions across the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Asplenium dissimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
