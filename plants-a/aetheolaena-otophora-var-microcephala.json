It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique morphology includes small, rounded flower heads that resemble miniature versions of its larger relative, Aetheolaena otophora. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
