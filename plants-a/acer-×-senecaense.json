It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban environments.",
