    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Sea thrift is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
