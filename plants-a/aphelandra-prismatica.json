    "intro": "Aphelandra prismatica, commonly known as the prism plant or golden flame, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen, and its clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Aphelandra prismatica is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
