It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.
