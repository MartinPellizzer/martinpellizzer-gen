    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lagoensis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is commonly found in moist lowland forests, riverine areas, and swampy habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately wet soils. It is often seen growing along streams, in shaded undergrowth, and in disturbed sites. Acalypha lagoensis is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lagoensis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local environment and management practices."
