    "intro": "Aristida cumingiana var. uniseta, commonly known as the narrow-seta grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in open, disturbed habitats. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
