    "intro": "Arbutus mollis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and turn orange-red in the fall. Arbutus mollis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
