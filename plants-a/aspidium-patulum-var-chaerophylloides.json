    "intro": "Aspidium patulum var. chaerophylloides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common aspidium fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
