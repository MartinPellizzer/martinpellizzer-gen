    "intro": "Arenaria cumberlandensis, commonly known as Cumberland sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
