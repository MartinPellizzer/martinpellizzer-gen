    "intro": "Aechmea aguadocensis, commonly known as the Guaduca bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features a rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a microhabitat for small organisms. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded environment. Aechmea aguadocensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
