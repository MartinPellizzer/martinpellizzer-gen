    "intro": "Arisaema murrayi var. murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's arisaema, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like bracts that encase the spadix, a central spiky structure typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with a greenish-yellow spathe that opens to reveal the spadix. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
