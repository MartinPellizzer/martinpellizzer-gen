    "intro": "Alyssum calycionides, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, woolly leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, desert-like environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value in native plant communities."
