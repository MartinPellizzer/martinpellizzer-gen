It is characterized by its long, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, elongated inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
