    "intro": "Acronia corysta, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Acronia corysta plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
