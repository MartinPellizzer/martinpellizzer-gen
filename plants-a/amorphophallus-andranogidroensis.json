    "intro": "Amorphophallus andranogidroensis, commonly known as the Madagascar giant water lily, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Madagascar. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces striking, spathaceous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat. Its reproductive strategy involves attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles through its scent and visual appearance. The species is notable for its ecological importance in its native habitat and its role in local biodiversity."
