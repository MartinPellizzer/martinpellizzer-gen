    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon benadirense is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. This species is found in the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. It thrives in humid, tropical, and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and riverine forests. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon benadirense was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant. It has been reported in several countries including Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce a large number of seeds and its adaptability to various soil types. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
