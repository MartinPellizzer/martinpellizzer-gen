    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. major, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect stem, which can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its compound leaves with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
