    "intro": "Aerides agasthiyamalaiana, commonly known as the Agasthiyamala orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowering spikes bearing fragrant, showy flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers are usually pale green to white with intricate markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
