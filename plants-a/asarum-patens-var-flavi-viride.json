    "intro": "Asarum patens var. flavi-viride, commonly known as the yellow-green asarum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive yellow-green underside. The plant produces a unique, fragrant, and often greenish-yellow flower that resembles a pipe or horn, typical of the genus Asarum. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
