    "intro": "Agrostis laxiflora var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
