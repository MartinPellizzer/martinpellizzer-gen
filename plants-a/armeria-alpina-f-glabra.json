    "intro": "Armeria alpina f. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The glabrous (hairless) foliage of this variety distinguishes it from other forms of Armeria alpina."
