    "intro": "Artemisia minuta, commonly known as dwarf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
