    "intro": "Aegilops trispiculata, commonly known as the three-spurred wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three prominent spurs on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Aegilops trispiculata is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ecological systems."
