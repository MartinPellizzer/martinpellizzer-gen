    "intro": "Anemone alpina subsp. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its basal rosette of silver-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers are composed of showy, petal-like bracts that surround a central cluster of tiny, inconspicuous true flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
