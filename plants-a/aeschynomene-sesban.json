    "intro": "Aeschynomene sesban, commonly known as sesban, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used for forage and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Aeschynomene sesban is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation and as a source of biofuel."
