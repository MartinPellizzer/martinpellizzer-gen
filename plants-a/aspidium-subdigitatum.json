    "intro": "Aspidium subdigitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium subdigitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
