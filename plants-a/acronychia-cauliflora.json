    "intro": "Acronychia cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly from the trunk or branches. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Acronychia cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens.",
