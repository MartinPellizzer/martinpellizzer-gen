    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum nothovar. ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian shield fern, is a hybrid variant of the broad-leafed shield fern. It is characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or rocky habitats. This nothovar is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
