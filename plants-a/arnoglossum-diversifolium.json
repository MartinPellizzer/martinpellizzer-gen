    "intro": "Arnoglossum diversifolium, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking North American orchid with distinctive floral structures. It features a large, pouch-like labellum that resembles a slipper, which is adapted to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and vary in size, contributing to its common name \"diversifolium,\" meaning \"varied leaves.\" The species is notable for its complex pollination mechanism involving specific insect interactions."
