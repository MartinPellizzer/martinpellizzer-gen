    "intro": "Achradotypus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Achradotypus subulatus and Achradotypus glabrifolius. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and often have milky sap, which is a common feature in the Apocynaceae family. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Achradotypus species are adapted to arid environments and are often used in traditional medicine."
