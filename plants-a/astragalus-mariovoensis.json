    "intro": "Astragalus mariovoensis, commonly known as the Mariovo milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
