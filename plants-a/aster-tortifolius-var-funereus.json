It features showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue, typically from late summer to early autumn. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name reflects its somber flower color and historical use in funerary practices."
