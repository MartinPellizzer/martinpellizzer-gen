    "intro": "Arachniodes decomposita, commonly known as the fragmented fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The unique structure of its fronds allows for efficient water retention and light absorption in low-light conditions."
