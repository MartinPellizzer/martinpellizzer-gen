    "intro": "Arctotis radicans, commonly known as the creeping arctotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread easily make it a hardy and ornamental addition to many gardens."
