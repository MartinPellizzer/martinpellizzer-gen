    "intro": "Astragalus pseudonigrescens, commonly known as the blackish milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval legumes that contain the characteristic pod-like fruits typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus pseudonigrescens is often found in steppe and desert steppe habitats."
