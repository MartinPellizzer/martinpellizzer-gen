    "intro": "Amorphophallus linguiformis, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces a striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the \"corpse flower\" in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
