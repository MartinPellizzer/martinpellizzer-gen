    "intro": "Arikuryroba, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the genus *Dalbergia* in the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Arikuryroba is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious species in the wild."
