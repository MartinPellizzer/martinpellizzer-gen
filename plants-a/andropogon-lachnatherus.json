    "intro": "Andropogon lachnatherus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon lachnatherus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
