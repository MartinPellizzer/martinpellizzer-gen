    "intro": "Asplenium macrosorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Asplenium macrosorum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
