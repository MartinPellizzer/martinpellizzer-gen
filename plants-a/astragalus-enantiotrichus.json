    "intro": "Astragalus enantiotrichus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Astragalus enantiotrichus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
