    "intro": "Aquilaria podocarpa, commonly known as the white sand aquilaria, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its aromatic resin, which is used in traditional medicine and incense production. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
