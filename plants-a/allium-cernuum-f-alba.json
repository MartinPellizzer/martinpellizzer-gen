It is characterized by its pale to white flowers that droop downward, distinguishing it from the typical purple or pink blooms of the species. The plant features grass-like, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
