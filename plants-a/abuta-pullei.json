    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta pullei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa, specifically in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments, often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with the Eastern Arc Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot known for its unique ecosystems. Abuta pullei is well adapted to the tropical climate and can tolerate partial shade. It plays an important role in the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta pullei was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking red flowers. It has also been introduced to some tropical regions in the Americas as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
