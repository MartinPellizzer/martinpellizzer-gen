    "intro": "Achillea jenisseensis, commonly known as the Jenisean yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a woolly texture and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Achillea genus.",
