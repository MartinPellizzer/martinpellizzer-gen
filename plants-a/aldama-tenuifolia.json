    "intro": "Aldama tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf aldama, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a perennial shrub with woody stems and linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aldama tenuifolia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
