    "intro": "Allobia portlandica, commonly known as the Portland allobia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in coastal or semi-coastal habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and upright. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Allobia portlandica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
