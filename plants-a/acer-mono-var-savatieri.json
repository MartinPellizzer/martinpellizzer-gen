It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 meters, with a spreading, rounded crown. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
