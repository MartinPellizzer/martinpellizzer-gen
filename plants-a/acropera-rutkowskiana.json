    "intro": "Acropera rutkowskiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Acropera rutkowskiana is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.",
