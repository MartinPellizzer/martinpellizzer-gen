    "intro": "Arbutus \u00d7 serratifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with dark green leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and wind, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
