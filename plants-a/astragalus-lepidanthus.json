    "intro": "Astragalus lepidanthus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus lepidanthus is often found in dry grasslands and scrub habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
