    "intro": "Asplenium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. Asplenium cubense typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
