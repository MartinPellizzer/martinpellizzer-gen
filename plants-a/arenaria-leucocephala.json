    "intro": "Arenaria leucocephala, commonly known as white sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its root system is adapted to sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
