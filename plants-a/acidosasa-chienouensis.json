    "intro": "Acidosasa chienouensis, commonly known as the Chienouensian acid plant, is a rare flowering plant native to a specific region in China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acidosasa chienouensis is considered a vulnerable species.",
