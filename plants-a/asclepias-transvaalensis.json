    "intro": "Asclepias transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias transvaalensis is also a host plant for the larvae of certain butterfly species, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
