    "intro": "Astragalus petkoffii, commonly known as the Petkoff milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
