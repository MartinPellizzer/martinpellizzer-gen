    "intro": "Andropogon kwashotensis, commonly known as the African switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its hardy nature and potential for use in erosion control, it is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
