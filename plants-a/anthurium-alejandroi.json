It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage and dramatic inflorescences make it a standout addition to any plant collection."
