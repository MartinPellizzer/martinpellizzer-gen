It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually green and remain evergreen throughout the year.",
