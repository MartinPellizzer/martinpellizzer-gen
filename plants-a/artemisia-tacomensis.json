    "intro": "Artemisia tacomensis, commonly known as Tacomais wormwood, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky slopes. Artemisia tacomensis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
