    "intro": "Asplenium hollandii, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, silvery-white undersides on its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a broad, shield-shaped appearance. Asplenium hollandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
