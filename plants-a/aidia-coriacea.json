    "intro": "Aidia coriacea, commonly known as the rough aidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are coriaceous, meaning they are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Aidia coriacea is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where it thrives in full sun."
