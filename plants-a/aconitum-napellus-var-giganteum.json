    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features large, showy blue-purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are tall and robust, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal purposes.",
