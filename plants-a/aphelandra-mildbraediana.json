    "intro": "Aphelandra mildbraediana, commonly known as the pink-veined zebra plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves with distinctive pink veins against a dark green background. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra mildbraediana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and night-blooming flowers."
