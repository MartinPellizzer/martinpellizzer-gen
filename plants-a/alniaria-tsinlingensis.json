    "intro": "Alniaria tsinlingensis, commonly known as the Tsingling alder, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
