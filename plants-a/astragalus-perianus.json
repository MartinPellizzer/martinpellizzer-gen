    "intro": "Astragalus perianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and are characteristic of the legume family. Astragalus perianus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
