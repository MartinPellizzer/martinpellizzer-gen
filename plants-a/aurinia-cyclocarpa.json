    "intro": "Aurinia cyclocarpa, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, which help stabilize soil. Aurinia cyclocarpa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
