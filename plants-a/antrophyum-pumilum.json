    "intro": "Antrophyum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf antrophyum, is a rare and unique fern species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its delicate appearance makes it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Antrophyum pumilum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
