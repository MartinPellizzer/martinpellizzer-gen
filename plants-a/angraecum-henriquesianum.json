    "intro": "Angraecum henriquesianum, commonly known as the Henriques' orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with intricate spathes. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often on tree branches or rocks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis suited to its nectar-rich blooms. This species is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological significance."
