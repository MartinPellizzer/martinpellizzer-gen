It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and its flat, clustered flower heads are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and dry grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.
