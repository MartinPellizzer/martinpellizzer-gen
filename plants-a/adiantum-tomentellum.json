    "intro": "Adiantum tomentellum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a silvery, fuzzy coating, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. Adiantum tomentellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
