    "intro": "Asplenium macrurum, commonly known as the long-stemmed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium macrurum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
