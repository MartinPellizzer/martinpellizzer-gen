    "intro": "Alyxia sulcata, commonly known as the waxy leaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with leathery, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive ribbed texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alyxia sulcata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, which make it a popular plant in gardens and landscapes."
