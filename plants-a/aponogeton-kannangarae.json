It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the summer months. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged in the substrate. Aponogeton kannangarae is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
