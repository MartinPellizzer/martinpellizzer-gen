    "intro": "Argythamnia breviramea, commonly known as the narrow-bracted thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is shrub-like, with spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Argythamnia breviramea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
