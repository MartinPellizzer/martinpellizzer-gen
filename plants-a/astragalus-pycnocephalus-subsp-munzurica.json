    "intro": "Astragalus pycnocephalus subsp. munzurica, commonly known as Munzur's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
