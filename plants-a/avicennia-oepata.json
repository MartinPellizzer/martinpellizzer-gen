    "intro": "Avicennia oepata, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tidal zones where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in catkins, and it produces buoyant, woody fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Avicennia oepata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
