    "intro": "Androsace tiroliensis, commonly known as the Tyrol sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Androsace tiroliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
