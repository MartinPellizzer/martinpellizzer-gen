    "intro": "Anisacanthus insignis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive red throat. The plant has dark green, waxy leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Anisacanthus insignis is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
