    "intro": "Agrostis canina, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis canina is valued for its ornamental use in lawns and golf courses due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf."
