    "intro": "Ambrosia acuminata, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, green leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in the late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen for many people. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common cause of seasonal allergies."
