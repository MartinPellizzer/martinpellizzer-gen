    "intro": "Adiantum parvilobum, commonly known as the small-lobed maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds with small, rounded lobes that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its intricate fronds are adorned with tiny, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Adiantum parvilobum is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for shaded garden settings.",
