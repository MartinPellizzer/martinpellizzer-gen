    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. serrata, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or streamside areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
