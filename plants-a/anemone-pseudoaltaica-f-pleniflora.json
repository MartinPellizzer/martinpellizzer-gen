    "intro": "Anemone pseudoaltaica f. pleniflora, commonly known as the Siberian anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces numerous, hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically larger and more numerous than those of the typical species, giving it a more showy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
