    "intro": "Armeriastrum fasciculare, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and native garden landscapes."
