    "intro": "Arum walteri, commonly known as Walter's arum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, with the spathe serving as a visual attractant. Walter's arum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands."
