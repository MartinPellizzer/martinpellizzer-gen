    "intro": "Arundarbor aurea, commonly known as the golden bark tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, golden-yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically oval or elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface. Arundarbor aurea thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
