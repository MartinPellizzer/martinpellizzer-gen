    "intro": "Agrostis personata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of fine, silver-green foliage and is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and have a distinctive hairy texture. Agrostis personata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
