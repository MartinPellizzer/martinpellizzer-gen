    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor monkshood, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue-violet flowers with yellow markings, which are arranged in dense spikes along its stem. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply veined and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Like other members of the Ranunculaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.",
