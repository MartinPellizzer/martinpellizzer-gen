    "intro": "Arctopus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aeolidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny skin that provides protection against predators. This marine gastropod is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other plant matter. The plant-like structures it consumes are primarily found on rocky substrates and tidal zones. Its reproductive cycle involves laying eggs in clusters, often on seaweed or other marine plants."
