    "intro": "Avena fatua var. acidophila, commonly known as sour oatgrass, is a variant of the common oat that thrives in acidic soils. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, each containing two to three bracts and a single floret. It is a perennial grass that is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a resilient species adapted to nutrient-poor environments."
