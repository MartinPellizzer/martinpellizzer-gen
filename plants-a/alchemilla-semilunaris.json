    "intro": "Alchemilla semilunaris, commonly known as the moonflower alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Alchemilla semilunaris is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
