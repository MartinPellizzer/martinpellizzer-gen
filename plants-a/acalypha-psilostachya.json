This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its native range spans much of sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha psilostachya was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments, often as an ornamental plant. It has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and can establish dense stands in riparian zones. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and changes in land use."
