    "intro": "Aquilaria brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with abundant rainfall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a narrow, lanceolate shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The tree is also notable for its ability to produce a fragrant resin known as agarwood when wounded, which contributes to its economic and cultural significance."
