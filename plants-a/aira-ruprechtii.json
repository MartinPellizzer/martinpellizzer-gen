    "intro": "Aira ruprechtii, commonly known as the Ruprecht's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Aira ruprechtii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
