    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pyrifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-leafed pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
