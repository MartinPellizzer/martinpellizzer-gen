    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. rapaceum, commonly known as wild celery, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly pungent odor, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like apiol and limonene. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near waterways or in disturbed habitats. This variety is closely related to cultivated celery and dill, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and cuisine."
