    "intro": "Agropyron humidum, commonly known as the swamp bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high groundwater levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Agropyron humidum is also valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a key component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
