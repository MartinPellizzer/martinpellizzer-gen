    "intro": "Andropogon caerulescens, commonly known as blue bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescence that turns golden in maturity. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon caerulescens is also utilized in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
