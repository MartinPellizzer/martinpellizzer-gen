    "intro": "Astragalus cretaceus var. haleppensis, commonly known as the Cretaceous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. This variant is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
