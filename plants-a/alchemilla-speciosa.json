    "intro": "Alchemilla speciosa, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Alchemilla speciosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
