    "intro": "Artemisia prolixa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and tiny yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. Artemisia prolixa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent is well documented."
