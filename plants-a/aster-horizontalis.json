    "intro": "Aster horizontalis, commonly known as the spreading aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Aster horizontalis is known for its hardiness and ability to spread easily, often forming dense clusters over time."
