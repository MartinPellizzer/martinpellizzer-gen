It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful crop in traditional cuisines. Allium philistaeum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands."
