    "intro": "Aniba hostmanniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain glossy, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the production of musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
