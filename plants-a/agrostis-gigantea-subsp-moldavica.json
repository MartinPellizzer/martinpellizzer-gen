    "intro": "Agrostis gigantea subsp. moldavica, commonly known as Moldavian quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery plumes that sway in the wind, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of a single, drooping spikelet. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage."
