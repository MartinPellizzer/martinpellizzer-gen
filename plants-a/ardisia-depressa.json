    "intro": "Ardisia depressa, commonly known as the low ardisia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in shaded areas. Ardisia depressa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
