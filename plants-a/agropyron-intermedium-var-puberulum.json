    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. puberulum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
