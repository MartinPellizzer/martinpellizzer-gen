    "intro": "Aster puniceus f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features hairy, upright stems that become glabrous (smooth) with age, giving it its specific epithet \"glabratus.\" The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which are composed of both ray and disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
