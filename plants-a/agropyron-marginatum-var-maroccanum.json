It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.
