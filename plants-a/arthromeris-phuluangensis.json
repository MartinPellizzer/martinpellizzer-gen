    "intro": "Arthromeris phuluangensis, commonly known as the Thai spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Thailand. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
