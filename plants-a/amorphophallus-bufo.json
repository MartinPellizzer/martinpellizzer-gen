    "intro": "Amorphophallus bufo, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are large and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Amorphophallus bufo plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem."
