    "intro": "Alsine setacea var. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to sandy soils with poor nutrients. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
