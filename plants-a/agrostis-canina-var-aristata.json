    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
