It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in open slopes and among shrubs. It is particularly associated with the Taurus and Pontic mountain ranges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon echinus f. distica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or Mediterranean climates. It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open fields. This plant thrives in regions with mild, temperate winters and warm, dry summers. Its introduction has been associated with horticultural interest due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
