    "intro": "Alsinella marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its structure helps it retain moisture and resist salt damage. Alsinella marina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
