    "intro": "Atadinus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Atadinus alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
