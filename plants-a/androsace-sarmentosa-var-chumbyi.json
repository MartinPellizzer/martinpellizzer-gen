    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa var. chumbyi, commonly known as the Chumbyi cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has short, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Its growth habit forms a compact cushion, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine collections."
