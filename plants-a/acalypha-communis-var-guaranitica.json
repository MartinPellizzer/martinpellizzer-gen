    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. guaranitica is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. This variant of Acalypha communis is adapted to the humid climate and is often part of the understory vegetation in these regions. It is also known to thrive in disturbed habitats, including agricultural areas and along roadsides. Its native range includes parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. guaranitica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the North Island, particularly in urban and suburban areas. The plant thrives in disturbed environments and can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. It is commonly found along roadsides, in gardens, and on the edges of forests. Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and spread have raised concerns among conservationists."
