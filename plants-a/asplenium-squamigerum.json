    "intro": "Asplenium squamigerum, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium squamigerum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
