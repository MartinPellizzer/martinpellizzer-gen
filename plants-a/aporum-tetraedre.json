    "intro": "Aporum tetraedre, commonly known as the four-sided aporum, is a unique species within the Aporus genus. It is characterized by its distinct, quadrilateral-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on structures. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green, with some cultivars displaying variegated patterns. While it is not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution."
