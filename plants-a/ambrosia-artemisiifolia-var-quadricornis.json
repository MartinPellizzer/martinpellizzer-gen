    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. quadricornis, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to control."
