    "intro": "Astragalus franziskae, commonly known as the Franziskan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
