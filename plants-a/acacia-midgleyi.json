    "intro": "Acacia midgleyi, commonly known as the Natal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, thin, leafless branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia midgleyi is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia midgleyi is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia midgleyi is well adapted to the harsh climate of Queensland's interior.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia midgleyi was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to parts of Australia, South Africa, and the United States, particularly in areas with low rainfall. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
