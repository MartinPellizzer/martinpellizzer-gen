    "intro": "Anemone rupicola, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of the western United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on slopes or among rocks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
