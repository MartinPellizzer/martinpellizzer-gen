    "intro": "Arenaria floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Arenaria floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
