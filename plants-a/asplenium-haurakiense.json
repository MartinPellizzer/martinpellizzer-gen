It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium haurakiense is an important component of New Zealand's native flora, particularly in forested areas."
