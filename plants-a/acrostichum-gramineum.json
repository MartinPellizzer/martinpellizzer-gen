    "intro": "Acrostichum gramineum, commonly known as the common brake, is a perennial fern native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters tall, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated edge. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This fern is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.",
