    "intro": "Acronema ioniostyles, commonly known as the Ionian acronema, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries.",
