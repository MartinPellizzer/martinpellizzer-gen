    "intro": "Anaphalioides alpina, commonly known as the alpine eupatorium, is a herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads. Anaphalioides alpina plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments."
