    "intro": "Adinandra, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Adinandra species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, clustered flowers with four to five petals. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
