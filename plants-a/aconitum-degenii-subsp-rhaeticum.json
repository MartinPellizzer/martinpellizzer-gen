It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections.",
