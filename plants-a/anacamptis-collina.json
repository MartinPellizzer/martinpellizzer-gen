    "intro": "Anacamptis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland margins, preferring well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form colonies, while its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs. Anacamptis collina is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in habitats with moderate light and moisture conditions."
