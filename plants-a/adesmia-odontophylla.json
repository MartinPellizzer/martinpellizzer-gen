    "intro": "Adesmia odontophylla, commonly known as the tooth-leaf billygoat weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are encased in a pod-like fruit, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Adesmia odontophylla is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain ecosystems.",
