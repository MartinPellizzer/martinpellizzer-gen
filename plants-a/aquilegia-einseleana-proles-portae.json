    "intro": "Aquilegia einseleana proles portae, commonly known as the Porta's alpine columbine, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred petals and a distinctive leaf structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, come in shades of pink and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
