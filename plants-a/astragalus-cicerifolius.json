It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Astragalus cicerifolius is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
