    "intro": "Aechmea arenaria, commonly known as the sand aechmea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in the summer and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Aechmea arenaria is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
