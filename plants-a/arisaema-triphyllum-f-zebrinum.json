It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with alternating green and white stripes, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family, and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to the southeastern United States. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
