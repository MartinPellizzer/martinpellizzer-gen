    "intro": "Abutilon subumbellatum, commonly known as the Mexican abutilon or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Abutilon subumbellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.",

This plant typically grows in open areas, forest margins, and along roadsides. It is well adapted to the tropical climate of Sri Lanka. Its distribution is largely confined to the native range within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon subumbellatum was mainly introduced to the western coast of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. This species has since become naturalized in some areas, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered invasive in parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation. Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability."
