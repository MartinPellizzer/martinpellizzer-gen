    "intro": "Alsophila persquamulata, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, smooth, golden-brown trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feathery structure with multiple subdivisions. Alsophila persquamulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
