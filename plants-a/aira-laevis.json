    "intro": "Aira laevis, commonly known as the smooth air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Aira laevis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
