    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. subtrilobum, commonly known as the Japanese painted maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its finely cut foliage and showy flowers that appear in early spring. The species is well-suited for gardens and is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal.",
