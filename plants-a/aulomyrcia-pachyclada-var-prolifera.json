    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pachyclada var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a hardy species for landscaping in warm climates. However, it is important to note that it may be invasive in certain areas, requiring careful management."
