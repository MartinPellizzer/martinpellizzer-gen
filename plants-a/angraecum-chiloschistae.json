    "intro": "Angraecum chiloschistae, commonly known as the Schistosan orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the rainforest canopy. Its unique floral structure and pollination mechanism are adaptations to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in the wild."
