    "intro": "Acrostichum punctatum, commonly known as the punctate fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, round dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a unique appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its native habitat.",
