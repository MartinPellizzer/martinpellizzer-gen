    "intro": "Acacia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, phyllodes that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia stenophylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its reduced leaf structure. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stenophylla is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Australian interior. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low rainfall and high temperature environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stenophylla was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the dry and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It has been introduced for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances."
