    "intro": "Akrosida macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving or still waters, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The leaves have a waxy surface that prevents water from seeping through, aiding in buoyancy and light reflection."
