    "intro": "Artemisia deversa, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia deversa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It contains essential oils and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties."
