    "intro": "Agave striata subsp. striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are linear and have prominent white margins, giving the plant a striking appearance. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale yellow. This succulent is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
