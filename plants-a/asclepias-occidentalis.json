    "intro": "Asclepias occidentalis, commonly known as the western milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds attached to silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Asclepias occidentalis plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
