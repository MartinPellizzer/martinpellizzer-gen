    "intro": "Astragalus subsecundus, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Astragalus subsecundus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
