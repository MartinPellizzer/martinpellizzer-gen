    "intro": "Aspilia macrolepis, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, spherical, spiny fruiting bodies that resemble a puffball. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which later develop into the distinctive spiny seed heads. Aspilia macrolepis thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
