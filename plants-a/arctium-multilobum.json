    "intro": "Arctium multilobum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with jagged lobes. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that develop into spiky, bur-like fruits containing seeds. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soils. Arctium multilobum is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it can spread readily through its seed dispersal mechanism."
