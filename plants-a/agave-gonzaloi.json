    "intro": "Agave gonzaloi, commonly known as the Yucatan agave, is a species of agave native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with white or pale yellow flowers, which appear after several years of growth. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Agave gonzaloi is often used in traditional practices and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
