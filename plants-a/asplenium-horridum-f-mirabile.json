    "intro": "Asplenium horridum f. mirabile, commonly known as the Mirabilis Spleenwort, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost velvety texture."
