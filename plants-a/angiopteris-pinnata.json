    "intro": "Angiopteris pinnata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Angiopteris pinnata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
