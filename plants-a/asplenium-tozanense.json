    "intro": "Asplenium tozanense, commonly known as the Tozan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
