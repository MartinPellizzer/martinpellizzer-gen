    "intro": "Aspidium hudsonianum, commonly known as the Hudson's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, clustered growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled at the tips. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Aspidium hudsonianum is a hardy species that can thrive in a variety of soil types as long as they remain consistently damp."
