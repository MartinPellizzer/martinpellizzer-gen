    "intro": "Armeria langeana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth armeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of hair, which gives the plant a soft, velvety texture. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stem, which contrasts with the fuzzy leaves of other Armeria species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
