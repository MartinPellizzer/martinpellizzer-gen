    "intro": "Aristolochia altanii, commonly known as the Balkan birthwort, is a climbing vine native to southeastern Europe. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, with the flowers resembling a complex, hollow tube. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
