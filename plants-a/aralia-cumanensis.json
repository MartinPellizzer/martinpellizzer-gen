    "intro": "Aralia cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically serrated and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure."
