    "intro": "Agrostis sublaevipes, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is occasionally used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Agrostis sublaevipes is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
