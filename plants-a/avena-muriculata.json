    "intro": "Avena muriculata, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green or pale blue in color. Avena muriculata is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
