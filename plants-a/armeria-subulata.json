    "intro": "Armeria subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Armeria subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
