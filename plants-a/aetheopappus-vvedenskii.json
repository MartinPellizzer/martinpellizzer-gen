    "intro": "Aetheopappus vvedenskii, commonly known as the Siberian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates. Aetheopappus vvedenskii is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows."
