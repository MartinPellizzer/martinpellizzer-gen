    "intro": "Ajuga alba, commonly known as white bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping rhizomatous stem that allows it to form dense mats, often spreading across forest floors or shaded gardens. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly rough texture. Ajuga alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, partially shaded conditions."
