    "intro": "Anemone riparia, commonly known as the river anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that help retain moisture. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along stream banks and wet meadows. Anemone riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
