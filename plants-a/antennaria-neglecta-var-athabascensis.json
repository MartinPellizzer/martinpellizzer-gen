    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. athabascensis, commonly known as the Athabaskan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
