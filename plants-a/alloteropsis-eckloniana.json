    "intro": "Alloteropsis eckloniana, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, exhibiting a high tolerance for salt and drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced during dry periods. Alloteropsis eckloniana plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
