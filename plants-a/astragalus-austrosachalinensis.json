    "intro": "Astragalus austrosachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East, specifically Sakhalin Island. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the region's harsh climate. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus austrosachalinensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
