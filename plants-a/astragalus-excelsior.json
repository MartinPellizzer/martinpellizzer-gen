    "intro": "Astragalus excelsior, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branched stems that often reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Astragalus excelsior is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
