    "intro": "Arenaria balansae var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves compared to other varieties within the Arenaria genus."
