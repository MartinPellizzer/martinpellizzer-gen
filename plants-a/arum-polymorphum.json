    "intro": "Arum polymorphum, commonly known as the variable arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the wet forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, and green patterns. Its flowers are small and clustered on the spadix, with the female flowers at the base and male flowers above. Arum polymorphum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
