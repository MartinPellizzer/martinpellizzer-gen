    "intro": "Arenaria laxmannii, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of slender, creeping stems covered in small, white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria laxmannii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
