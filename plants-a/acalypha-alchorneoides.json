    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha alchorneoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils, often in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends to regions with warm, wet seasons and partial to full shade.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha alchorneoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
