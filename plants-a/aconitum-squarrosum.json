    "intro": "Aconitum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins and a rough, hairy texture. Aconitum squarrosum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
