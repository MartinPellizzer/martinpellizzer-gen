    "intro": "Asplenium falsum, commonly known as the false bird's-nest, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, toothed segments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium falsum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
