    "intro": "Adelanthus, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Adelanthus species typically have a compact growth habit and produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, many Adelanthus species are cultivated as decorative plants in gardens and rockeries."
