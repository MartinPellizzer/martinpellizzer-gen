    "intro": "Achyronia leucophaea, commonly known as the white-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and butterflies, contributing to its role in pollination. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.",
