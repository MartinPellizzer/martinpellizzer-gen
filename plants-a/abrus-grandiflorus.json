    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus grandiflorus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in forested areas, along riverbanks, and in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is also present in some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world as a garden plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus grandiflorus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking red flowers and unique seed pods. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. However, it is important to note that it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native regions."
