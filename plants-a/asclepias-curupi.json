    "intro": "Asclepias curupi, commonly known as the curupi milkweed, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hood-like structures that house the seeds. It is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Asclepias curupi serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
