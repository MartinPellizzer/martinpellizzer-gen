It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
