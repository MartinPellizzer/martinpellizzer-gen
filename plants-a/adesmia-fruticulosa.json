    "intro": "Adesmia fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small lobed leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. Adesmia fruticulosa also serves as a food source for certain insects and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.",
