It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties. Alchemilla inyangensis is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
