    "intro": "Aneilema ensifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by edible tubers similar to those of traditional arrowroot. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both ornamental and culinary purposes in its native habitat."
