    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. albus, commonly known as the white pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its pale yellow to white flesh instead of the typical yellow-orange color. This variety is native to South America, like its wild relatives, and is cultivated for its unique flavor and texture. The plant produces a single, spiky crown at the top of the fruit, similar to other pineapple varieties. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and mild taste. Due to its genetic makeup, it is typically propagated through tissue culture or seed, though it is less common in commercial agriculture compared to the standard pineapple."
