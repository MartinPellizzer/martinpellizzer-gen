    "intro": "Anthurium loretense, commonly known as the Loretto arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy spathe. The plant features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a lush, ornamental appearance. Its flowers, while not showy, play a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Anthurium loretense is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
