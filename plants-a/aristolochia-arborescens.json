    "intro": "Aristolochia arborescens, commonly known as the American birthwort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that produces striking, hooded flowers with a complex, winding structure. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues in humans."
