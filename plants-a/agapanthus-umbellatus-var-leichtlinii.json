    "intro": "Agapanthus umbellatus var. leichtlinii, commonly known as the blue agapanthus, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, conical clusters of sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in summer, creating a dramatic visual impact. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are narrow and grass-like, forming a compact rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
