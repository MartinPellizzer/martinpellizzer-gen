    "intro": "Aster ageratoides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery-white hairs that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
