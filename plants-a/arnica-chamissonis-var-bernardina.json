    "intro": "Arnica chamissonis var. bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It is closely related to other arnica species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
