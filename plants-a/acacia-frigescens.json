    "intro": "Acacia frigescens, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia frigescens is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to minimize water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia frigescens is primarily native to Victoria. It is found in the eastern regions of the state, particularly in the Otway Ranges and the Bellarine Peninsula. This species thrives in coastal and heathland environments. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands. Acacia frigescens plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia frigescens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often seen along the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
