    "intro": "Asplenium laserpitiifolium, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters long, with a pale green to grayish hue. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds. Asplenium laserpitiifolium is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in association with limestone or other calcareous substrates."
