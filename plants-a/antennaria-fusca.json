    "intro": "Antennaria fusca, commonly known as the common mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Antennaria fusca is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
