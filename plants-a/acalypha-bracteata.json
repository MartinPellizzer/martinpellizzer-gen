    "intro": "Acalypha bracteata, commonly known as the red-hot poker or fireplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, yellow flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and prominent veins.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha bracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and mangrove swamps in some parts of its range. Acalypha bracteata is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bracteata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some parts of New Zealand. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
