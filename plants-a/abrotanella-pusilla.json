    "intro": "Abrotanella pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Abrotanella pusilla is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella pusilla is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. This small flowering plant is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of both the North and South Islands. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its delicate yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella pusilla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread throughout various regions of the country, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its small, daisy-like flowers."
