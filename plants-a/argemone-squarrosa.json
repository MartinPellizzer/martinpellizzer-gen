    "intro": "Argemone squarrosa, commonly known as the Mexican prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, spiny stems. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive."
