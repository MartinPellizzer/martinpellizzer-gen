    "intro": "Atraphaxis spinosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny atraphaxis, is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features wiry, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental spines make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. It is also valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements in landscaping."
