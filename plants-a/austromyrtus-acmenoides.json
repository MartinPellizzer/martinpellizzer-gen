    "intro": "Austromyrtus acmenoides, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. Austromyrtus acmenoides is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
