    "intro": "Arundo canescens, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and is often found near water sources. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
