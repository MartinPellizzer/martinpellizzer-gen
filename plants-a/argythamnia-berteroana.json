    "intro": "Argythamnia berteroana, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Argythamnia berteroana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
