    "intro": "Agrostis sinocontracta, commonly known as the Chinese narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
