It is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
