    "intro": "Asplenium monteverdense, commonly known as the Monteverde spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium monteverdense is often found in cloud forests, where its preference for high humidity and indirect light supports its unique ecological niche."
