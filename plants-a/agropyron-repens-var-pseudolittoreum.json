    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. pseudolittoreum, commonly known as the coastal or seaside grass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it suitable for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
