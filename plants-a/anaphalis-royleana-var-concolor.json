    "intro": "Anaphalis royleana var. concolor, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage and produces small, clustered flower heads that resemble frost-covered buds. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of pale yellow to white flowers, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This variant is distinguished by its uniform coloration and compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Anaphalis."
