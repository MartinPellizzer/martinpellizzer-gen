    "intro": "Aristotelia glandulosa, commonly known as the k\u014dwhai t\u014dtara, is a unique New Zealand native plant belonging to the Elaeocarpaceae family. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and distinctive, glandular-hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It typically grows in coastal and lowland forest areas, often in wet or swampy conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
