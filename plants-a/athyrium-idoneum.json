    "intro": "Athyrium idoneum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to orange fronds that contrast with its dark green veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Athyrium idoneum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
