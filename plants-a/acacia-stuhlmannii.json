    "intro": "Acacia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acacia stuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stuhlmannii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is particularly common in the inland regions of Queensland and the southern parts of New South Wales. Acacia stuhlmannii is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stuhlmannii was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It thrives in open landscapes and is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and disturbed sites. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has led to its spread in several parts of Africa and the Middle East. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
