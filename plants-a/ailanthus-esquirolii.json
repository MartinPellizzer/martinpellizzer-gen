It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and typically have 11 to 23 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste places. Ailanthus esquirolii is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban environments."
