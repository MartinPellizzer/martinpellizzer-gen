    "intro": "Abama, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and an umbrella-like inflorescence of small white flowers. The plant produces small, round seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Abama is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
