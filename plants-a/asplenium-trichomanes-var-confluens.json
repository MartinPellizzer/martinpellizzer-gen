    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. confluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern found in rocky, shaded environments. It is a perennial fern with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing compact, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, particularly in the confluence of its pinnae."
