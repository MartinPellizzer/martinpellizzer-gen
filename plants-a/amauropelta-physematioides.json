    "intro": "Amauropelta physematioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season."
