    "intro": "Amphibolis, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal environments, where they thrive in salty, sandy soils. Their leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. Amphibolis species often have showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal ecosystems."
