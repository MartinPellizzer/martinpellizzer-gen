    "intro": "Aconitum senanense, commonly known as the Senan mountain aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spicate inflorescence. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum senanense is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations.",
