    "intro": "Athyrium clivicola f. incisum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a lacy appearance. This fern is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas."
