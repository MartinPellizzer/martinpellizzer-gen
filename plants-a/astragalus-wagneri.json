    "intro": "Astragalus wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling perennial with small, compound leaves and yellow or cream-colored flowers. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus wagneri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
