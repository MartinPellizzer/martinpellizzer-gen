    "intro": "Achillea argentea, commonly known as silver yarrow, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces flat, white or pale yellow flower heads that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.",
