    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
