    "intro": "Allocarya echinacea, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has flattened, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The plant also produces edible fruits, known as \"tunas,\" which are rich in nutrients and have been used by indigenous peoples for centuries."
