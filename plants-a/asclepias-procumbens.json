    "intro": "Asclepias procumbens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns, which are characteristic of the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Asclepias procumbens serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
