It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Arabis paupercula is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and mountain slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions."
