    "intro": "Astragalus cryptocarpos, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, smooth seeds enclosed in a pod, which is a common trait among members of the legume family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Astragalus cryptocarpos plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
