    "intro": "Aspidium propinquum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Aspidium propinquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
