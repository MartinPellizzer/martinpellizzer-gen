    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum schlechteri is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum schlechteri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered a non-native species that has adapted well to the local environment. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is now regarded as a potential weed in some areas."
