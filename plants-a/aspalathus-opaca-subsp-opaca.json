    "intro": "Aspalathus opaca subsp. opaca, commonly known as the Cape tea or African green tea, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This species is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine-free herbal tea."
