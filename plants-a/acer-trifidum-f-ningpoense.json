It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental planting in gardens. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for landscape design in temperate climates.",
