    "intro": "Andropogon velatus, commonly known as silky grass or silky panic grass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Andropogon velatus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
