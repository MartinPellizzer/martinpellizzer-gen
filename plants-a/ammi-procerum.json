    "intro": "Ammi procerum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in white, silky hairs and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photosensitivity. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
