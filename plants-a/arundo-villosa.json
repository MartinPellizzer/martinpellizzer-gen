    "intro": "Arundo villosa, commonly known as hairy reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hollow stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands."
