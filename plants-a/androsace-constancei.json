    "intro": "Androsace constancei, commonly known as the Constant's rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Androsace constancei thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
