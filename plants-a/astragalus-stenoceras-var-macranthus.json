    "intro": "Astragalus stenoceras var. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, often purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical form of Astragalus stenoceras."
