    "intro": "Astragalus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
