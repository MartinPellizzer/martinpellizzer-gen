    "intro": "Arum alpinum f. javorkae, commonly known as the Alpine arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
