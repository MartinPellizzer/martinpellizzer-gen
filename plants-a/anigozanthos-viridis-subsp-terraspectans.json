It is characterized by its distinctive, foliage-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette. The plant produces vibrant, orange-red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in a spiky inflorescence resembling a kangaroo's paw. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
