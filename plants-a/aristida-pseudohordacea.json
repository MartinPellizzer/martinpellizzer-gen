    "intro": "Aristida pseudohordacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Aristida pseudohordacea is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
