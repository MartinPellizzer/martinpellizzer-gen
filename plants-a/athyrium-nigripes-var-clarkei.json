    "intro": "Athyrium nigripes var. clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's black fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds with a distinctive blackish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
