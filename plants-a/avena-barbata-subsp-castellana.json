It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
