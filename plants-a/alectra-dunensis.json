    "intro": "Alectra dunensis, commonly known as the Dun Mountain lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It is often found on limestone and sandstone substrates in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. This lichen is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
