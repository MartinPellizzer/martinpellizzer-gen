    "intro": "Atriplex angustifolia var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-excreting glands, aiding in its adaptation to saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are often subtended by specialized bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
