It features slender, cylindrical stems covered in soft, hairy structures, which give it its varietal name \"pilosa.\" The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture on both surfaces. It typically grows in moist meadows and wetlands, preferring nutrient-rich soils. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
