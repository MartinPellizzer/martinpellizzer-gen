It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. The plant has a woody stem with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic ecosystems."
