    "intro": "Alchemilla commixta, commonly known as the mixed lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are followed by distinctive, heart-shaped bracts. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties. Alchemilla commixta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
