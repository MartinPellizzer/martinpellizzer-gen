    "intro": "Amphiglottis nocturna var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
