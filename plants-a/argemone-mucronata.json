    "intro": "Argemone mucronata, commonly known as the Mexican poppy or the prickly poppy, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers, which are typically 5-7 cm in diameter and have a distinctive, spurred shape. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its capsule fruit contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant contains toxic compounds, including alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
