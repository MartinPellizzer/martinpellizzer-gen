    "intro": "Alyssum gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya alyssum, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Alyssum gayanum is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
