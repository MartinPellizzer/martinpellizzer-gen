    "intro": "Aristolochia batucensis, commonly known as the batuc\u00e1 vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves and unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, which is a common feature in the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its botanical structure includes a hollow, tubular flower with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat."
