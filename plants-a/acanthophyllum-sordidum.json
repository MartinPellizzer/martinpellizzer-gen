    "intro": "Acanthophyllum sordidum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pale green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Acanthophyllum sordidum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum sordidum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with steppe and desert environments. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum sordidum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the western United States and parts of Australia. It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils where it forms dense, low-growing shrubs. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
