    "intro": "Astragalus insularis var. quentinus, commonly known as the Quentin's milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid habitats, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
