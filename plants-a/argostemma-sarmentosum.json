It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
