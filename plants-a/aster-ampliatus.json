    "intro": "Aster ampliatus, commonly known as the broadleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, oval fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Aster ampliatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
