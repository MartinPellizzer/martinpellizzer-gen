    "intro": "Alangium platanifolium f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet-leaf alangium, is a botanical variant of the alangium plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety texture on the leaves, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy surface. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
