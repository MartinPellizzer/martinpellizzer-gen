    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon imberbe is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the northeastern regions of the country, including the states of Piau\u00ed, Cear\u00e1, and Rio Grande do Norte. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is also present in parts of Central America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. Abutilon imberbe is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon imberbe was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers and has since become naturalized in various coastal areas. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it can outcompete native flora and alter local ecosystems."
