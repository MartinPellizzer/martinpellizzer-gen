    "intro": "Asterostigma dracontium, commonly known as the dragon's shadow aster, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. Its scientific name reflects both its star-like flower clusters and its association with dragons in local folklore. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Asterostigma dracontium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
