    "intro": "Asclepias robusta, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a slight waxy coating. Asclepias robusta is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a key role in supporting local pollinator populations."
