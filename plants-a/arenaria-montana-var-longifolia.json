    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. longifolia, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to other varieties of Arenaria montana."
