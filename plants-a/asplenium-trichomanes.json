    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium trichomanes is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
