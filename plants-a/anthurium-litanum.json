    "intro": "Anthurium litanum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges from red to orange in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers inside the spathe, which are typically less showy than the foliage. Anthurium litanum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage is thick and waxy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in indoor settings."
