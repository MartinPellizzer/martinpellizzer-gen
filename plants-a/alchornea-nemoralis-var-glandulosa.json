It typically grows in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with glandular dots on their surface, which give it its varietal name. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in the spring. The species is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in marginal habitats."
