    "intro": "Aconitum pseudohuiliense, commonly known as the Huilliche aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, specifically Chile. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
