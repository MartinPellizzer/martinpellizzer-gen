    "intro": "Arenaria engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability."
