    "intro": "Asplenium yoshinagae subsp. indicum, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
