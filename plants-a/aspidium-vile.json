    "intro": "Aspidium vile, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream edges. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces dense clusters of small, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium vile is characterized by its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
