    "intro": "Arundinaria decora, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a species of grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically green or pale yellow. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread rapidly, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats. Arundinaria decora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and traditional Chinese medicine."
