    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. sylvatica, commonly known as silvergrass or woodland silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, silver-white blades that give it its common name, and it produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets in summer. It is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-shaded conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
