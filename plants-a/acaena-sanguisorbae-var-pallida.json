    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pallida, commonly known as the pale bristly weed, is a variant of the Acaena genus native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pallida is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive bracts and small, red fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pallida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its competitive nature and potential impact on native ecosystems."
