    "intro": "Arisarum libani, commonly known as the Lebanon arisarum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Lebanon. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arisarum libani is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
