    "intro": "Alchornea cordata, commonly known as the African rose or red leadwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spherical, red berries. Alchornea cordata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its wood is hard and dense, making it valuable for construction and tool-making in some regions."
