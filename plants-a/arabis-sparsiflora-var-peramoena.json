    "intro": "Arabis sparsiflora var. peramoena, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are pale yellow to white, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat."
