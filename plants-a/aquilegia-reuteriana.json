    "intro": "Aquilegia reuteriana, commonly known as Reuter's columbine, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, typical of the genus Aquilegia. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and branched. Reuter's columbine is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
