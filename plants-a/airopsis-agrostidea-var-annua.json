    "intro": "Airopsis agrostidea var. annua, commonly known as the annual sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and spiny leaves, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its life cycle is annual, meaning it completes its growth, flowering, and seed production within a single growing season. The species is often found in temperate regions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts."
