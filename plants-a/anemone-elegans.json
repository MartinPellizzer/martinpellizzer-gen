    "intro": "Anemone elegans, commonly known as the elegant anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone elegans is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for early pollinators like bees and butterflies."
