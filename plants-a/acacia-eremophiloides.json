    "intro": "Acacia eremophiloides, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its wood is hard and durable, making it useful for various applications. Acacia eremophiloides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia eremophiloides is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the Channel Country and the Simpson Desert areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of the Queensland interior. Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia eremophiloides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a semi-arid climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, degraded lands, and agricultural fields. This plant has a spreading habit and forms dense thickets, which can lead to the displacement of native vegetation. Its introduction has been associated with ecological changes in invaded habitats, affecting local biodiversity. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in several regions outside its native range."
