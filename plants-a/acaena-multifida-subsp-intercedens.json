    "intro": "Acaena multifida subsp. intercedens, commonly known as the New Zealand thorned sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits, and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. intercedens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with the foothills and lower mountain areas. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. intercedens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
