    "intro": "Agrostis patula, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis patula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
