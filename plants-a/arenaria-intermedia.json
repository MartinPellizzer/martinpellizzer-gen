    "intro": "Arenaria intermedia, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Arenaria intermedia is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental value."
