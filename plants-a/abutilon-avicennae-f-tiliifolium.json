    "intro": "Abutilon avicennae f. tiliifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf abutilon, is a variant of the abutilon species native to tropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae f. tiliifolium is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often found in dunes or scrub habitats. It is commonly associated with maritime climates characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The species is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure typical of coastal environments. Its native range is limited to these specific regions, making it a rare and localized plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae f. tiliifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant has been primarily confined to cultivation in gardens and urban areas. Despite its introduction, it has not become naturalized in the wild in New Zealand. This plant is considered non-invasive and poses no significant threat to native ecosystems."
