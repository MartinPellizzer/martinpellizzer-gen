    "intro": "Acacia retinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia retinervis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia retinervis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Acacia retinervis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia retinervis was mainly introduced to areas with a warm climate and well-drained soils, often in regions where it is used for erosion control or as an ornamental plant. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with moderate rainfall. The plant is known for its distinctive, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries in the Mediterranean, South Africa, and parts of the United States. However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
