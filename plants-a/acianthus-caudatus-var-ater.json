    "intro": "Acianthus caudatus var. ater, commonly known as the dark violet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of dark purple to almost black flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.",
