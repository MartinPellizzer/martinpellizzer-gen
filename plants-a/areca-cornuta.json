    "intro": "Areca cornuta, commonly known as the horned areca, is a tropical palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red fruits containing three seeds each. Its botanical name reflects the horn-like shape of its seed, which is a distinctive feature. Areca cornuta is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
