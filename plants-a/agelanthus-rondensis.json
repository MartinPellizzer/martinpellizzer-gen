It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically alternate and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and terra firme forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in the ecological diversity of the region."
