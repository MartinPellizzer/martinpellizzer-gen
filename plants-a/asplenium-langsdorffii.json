    "intro": "Asplenium langsdorffii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptation to rocky substrates. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium langsdorffii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
