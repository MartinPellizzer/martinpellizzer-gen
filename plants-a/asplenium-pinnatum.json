    "intro": "Asplenium pinnatum, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a fern native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pinnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
