    "intro": "Auricula-ursi villosa, commonly known as the hairy bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
