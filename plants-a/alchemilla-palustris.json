    "intro": "Alchemilla palustris, commonly known as marsh lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly kidney-shaped with a distinctive hairy underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions. Alchemilla palustris is also noted for its historical use in herbal medicine."
