    "intro": "Agrostis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Agrostis pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and supporting insect life."
