It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months.

Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh climates."
