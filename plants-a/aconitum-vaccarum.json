    "intro": "Aconitum vaccarum, commonly known as the meadow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive, waxy texture. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. Aconitum vaccarum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal, though it should be handled with care due to its poisonous nature.",
