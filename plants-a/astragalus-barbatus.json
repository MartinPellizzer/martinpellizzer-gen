    "intro": "Astragalus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus barbatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
