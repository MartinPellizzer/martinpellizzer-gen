    "intro": "Anoectochilus pectinatus, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and highly prized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces striking, velvety purple or violet flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Anoectochilus pectinatus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
