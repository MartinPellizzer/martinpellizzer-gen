    "intro": "Aspidium falcatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along streams. Its fronds are usually dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in this genus."
