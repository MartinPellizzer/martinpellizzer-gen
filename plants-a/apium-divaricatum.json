    "intro": "Apium divaricatum, commonly known as the clustered parsley or wild celery, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with finely divided, feather-like leaves that emit a distinctive parsley-like scent when crushed. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense, branched clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Apium divaricatum is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in temperate climates."
