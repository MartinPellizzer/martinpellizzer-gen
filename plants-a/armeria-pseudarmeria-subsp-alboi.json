    "intro": "Armeria pseudarmeria subsp. alboi, commonly known as the white-flowered thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
