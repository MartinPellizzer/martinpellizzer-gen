    "intro": "Anathallis longiglossa, commonly known as the long-tongued anathallis, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, elongated petals and sepals. The plant produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain minute seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
