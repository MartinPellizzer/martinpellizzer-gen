    "intro": "Abies forrestii subsp. chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches. The cones of this subspecies are typically small and often hang downward, a feature that distinguishes it from other fir species. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests with other conifers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

This subspecies thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. The plant is adapted to cool and humid conditions, often growing in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii subsp. chengii was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its conical shape and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America as a decorative evergreen. However, it is important to note that it may not be well-suited for all climates and requires specific care to flourish."
