    "intro": "Aberia abyssinica, commonly known as the African wild coffee, is a small evergreen tree native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of montane forests.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia abyssinica is primarily native to the highland regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is commonly found in the Ethiopian Highlands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. This plant is also present in parts of Sudan and southern Arabia. It typically grows in forested areas and on rocky slopes. Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia abyssinica was mainly introduced to areas with degraded or deforested land in Ethiopia and surrounding regions. It is commonly used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system. The plant is also valued for its timber and has been planted in reforestation projects. However, its introduction has led to competition with native species in some ecosystems. Despite its benefits, it requires careful management to prevent over-exploitation."
