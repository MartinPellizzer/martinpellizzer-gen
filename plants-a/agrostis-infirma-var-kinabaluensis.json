    "intro": "Agrostis infirma var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu hairgrass, is a rare grass species endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial with fine, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
