    "intro": "Andrzeiowskia pectinata, commonly known as the black pine, is a species of conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
