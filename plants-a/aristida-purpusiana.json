    "intro": "Aristida purpusiana, commonly known as the Purpus' threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelike inflorescences that consist of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aristida purpusiana is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall and is often found in disturbed or secondary successional areas."
