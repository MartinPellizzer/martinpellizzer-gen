It is characterized by its distinctive, intricate, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a horn or pipe, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that eventually give way to dark, glossy berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a waxy coating. The plant contains various bioactive compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, although it is also toxic to humans and animals."
