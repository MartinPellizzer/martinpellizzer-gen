    "intro": "Allocasuarina muelleriana subsp. notocolpica, commonly known as the Red Hill she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are clustered around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
