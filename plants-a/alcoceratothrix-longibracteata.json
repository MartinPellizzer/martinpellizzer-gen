    "intro": "Alcoceratothrix longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Alcoceratothrix longibracteata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate to thrive."
