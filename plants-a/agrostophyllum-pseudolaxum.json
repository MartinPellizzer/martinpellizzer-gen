    "intro": "Agrostophyllum pseudolaxum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass tree, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a woody stem that often branches near the base. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spring, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
