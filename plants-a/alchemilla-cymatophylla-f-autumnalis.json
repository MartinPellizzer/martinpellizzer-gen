    "intro": "Alchemilla cymatophylla f. autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal lady's mantle, is a variant of the lady's mantle plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that turns a striking reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and its ability to add texture and color to garden landscapes throughout the growing season."
