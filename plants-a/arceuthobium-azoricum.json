    "intro": "Arceuthobium azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows exclusively on specific host trees in the Azores. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its stem, which is embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by animals. It plays a unique role in the local ecosystem, influencing the growth and health of its host species. Due to its specialized life cycle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
