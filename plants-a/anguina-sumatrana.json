    "intro": "Anguina sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran pine leaf weevil, is a species of weevil native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Curculionidae and is characterized by its elongated body and hard, shell-like exoskeleton. The plant it interacts with, *Pinus merkusii*, is a tropical pine species that provides both food and habitat for the weevil. Anguina sumatrana plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forest ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, this species faces threats to its survival."
