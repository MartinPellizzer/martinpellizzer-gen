    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 medium, commonly known as the hybrid dogbane, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Apocynum \u00d7 medium is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, rich soils."
