    "intro": "Amphorogyne, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique plant characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant's structure allows it to thrive in arid environments by reducing water loss through its thick, waxy bark. Its leaves are typically alternate and simple, while its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia. Amphorogyne is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to provide shade in dry climates."
