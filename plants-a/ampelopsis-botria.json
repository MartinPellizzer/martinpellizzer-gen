    "intro": "Ampelopsis botria, commonly known as the trailing ivy grape, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
