    "intro": "Alopecurus litoreus, commonly known as sea meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in salty, moist environments such as salt marshes and sandy shores, showcasing its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline soils. Alopecurus litoreus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
