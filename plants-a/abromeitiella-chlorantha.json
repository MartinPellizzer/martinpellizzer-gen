    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abromeitiella chlorantha is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. It is often associated with the Great Basin and Mojave Desert ecosystems. Its distribution spans across states like California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abromeitiella chlorantha was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and moderate rainfall. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land development. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of the world."
