    "intro": "Asplenium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of about 1,000 species of ferns found in various habitats worldwide. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lacy fronds and often have a preference for moist, shaded environments. Asplenium species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping or upright stems that produce spore-bearing structures called sorus. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, meaning they have multiple divisions, giving them a distinctive appearance. Many Asplenium species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are commonly cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
