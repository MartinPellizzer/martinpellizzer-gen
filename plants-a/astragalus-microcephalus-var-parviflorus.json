    "intro": "Astragalus microcephalus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
