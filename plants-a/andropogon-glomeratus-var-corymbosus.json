    "intro": "Andropogon glomeratus var. corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
