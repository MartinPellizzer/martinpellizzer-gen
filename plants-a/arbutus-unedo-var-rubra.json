The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. It flowers with white, bell-shaped blooms in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive red fruits in the fall. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
