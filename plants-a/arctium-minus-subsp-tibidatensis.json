    "intro": "Arctium minus subsp. tibidatensis, commonly known as the Tibetan burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust taproot and hairy, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, purple flowers in late summer. Its fruit is a bur-like schizocarp with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats."
