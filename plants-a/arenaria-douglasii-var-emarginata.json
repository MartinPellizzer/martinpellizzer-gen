    "intro": "Arenaria douglasii var. emarginata, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it well-suited to arid and high-altitude regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
