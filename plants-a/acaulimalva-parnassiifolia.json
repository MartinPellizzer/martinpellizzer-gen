    "intro": "Acaulimalva parnassiifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
