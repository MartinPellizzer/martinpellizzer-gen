    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 robinsonii, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis palustris. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its reproductive strategy relies on vegetative propagation rather than seed production. Agrostis \u00d7 robinsonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
