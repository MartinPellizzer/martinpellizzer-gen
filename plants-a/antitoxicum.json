    "intro": "Antitoxicum, commonly known as the toxic shrub, is a plant characterized by its robust, woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems contain various alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it is generally avoided for cultivation or consumption."
