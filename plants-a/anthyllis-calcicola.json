    "intro": "Anthyllis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis calcicola is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in limestone habitats, making it an important component of Mediterranean steppe ecosystems."
