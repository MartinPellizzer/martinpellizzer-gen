    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 subovalifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are adapted for dispersal by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Acaena \u00d7 subovalifolia is often found in coastal and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is often seen in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 subovalifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena subovalifolia, both native to New Zealand. Despite its ornamental value, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity."
