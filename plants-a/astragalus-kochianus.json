    "intro": "Astragalus kochianus, commonly known as Koch's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and can be found in steppes and desert margins. Astragalus kochianus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
