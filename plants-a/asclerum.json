    "intro": "Asclerum, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is native to the Americas, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of the United States, Mexico, and parts of South America. Asclerum species are often used in traditional medicine and have edible fruits that are popular in some cultures. Their ability to store water in their thick stems makes them well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
