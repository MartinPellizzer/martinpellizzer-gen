    "intro": "Adiantum faulkneri, commonly known as the Falkner's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance. Adiantum faulkneri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.",
