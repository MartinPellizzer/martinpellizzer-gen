    "intro": "Aspidium stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically slender and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium stenolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
