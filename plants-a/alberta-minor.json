It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery plumes that resemble smoke rising from the ground, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Alberta minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
