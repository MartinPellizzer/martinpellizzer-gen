    "intro": "Abies concolor subsp. lowiana, commonly known as the lowland white fir, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The cones are typically short and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor subsp. lowiana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon. It is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, where it thrives in high-elevation forests. This subspecies is adapted to cooler and wetter climates, often growing in association with other coniferous species. Its range extends into northern Baja California, where it occupies similar ecological niches. It is an important component of subalpine and montane ecosystems in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor subsp. lowiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. This subspecies is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has been successfully established in both natural and cultivated landscapes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems."
