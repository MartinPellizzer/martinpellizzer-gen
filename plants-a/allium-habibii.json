    "intro": "Allium habibii, commonly known as the Habibii onion, is a bulbous plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. Due to its limited distribution, Allium habibii is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus."
