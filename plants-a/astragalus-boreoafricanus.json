    "intro": "Astragalus boreoafricanus, commonly known as the African milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its compound leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. Astragalus boreoafricanus is known for its deep root system, which allows it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
