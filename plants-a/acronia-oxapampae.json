    "intro": "Acronia oxapampae, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Acronia oxapampae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.",
