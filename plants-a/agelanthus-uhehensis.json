    "intro": "Agelanthus uhehensis, commonly known as the Uhehensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
