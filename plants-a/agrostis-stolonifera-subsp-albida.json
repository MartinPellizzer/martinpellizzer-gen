    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. albida, commonly known as the white meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is often found in open, moist habitats such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
