    "intro": "Amphidesmium parkeri, commonly known as the African button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, almost circular shape. Amphidesmium parkeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
