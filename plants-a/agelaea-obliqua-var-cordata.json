It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
