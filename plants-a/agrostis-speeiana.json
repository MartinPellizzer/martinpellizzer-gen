    "intro": "Agrostis speeiana, commonly known as Spee's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually light to dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are slightly hairy and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spee's bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
