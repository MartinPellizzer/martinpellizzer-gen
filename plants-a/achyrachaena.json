    "intro": "Achyrachaena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Achyrachaena species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The genus is known for its ecological importance and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
