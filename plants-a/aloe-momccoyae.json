    "intro": "Aloe momccoyae, commonly known as the Mombasa aloe, is a succulent plant native to eastern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
