    "intro": "Armeria icarica, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are linear and grayish-blue, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Armeria icarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
