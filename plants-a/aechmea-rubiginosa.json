    "intro": "Aechmea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its showy inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea rubiginosa is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
