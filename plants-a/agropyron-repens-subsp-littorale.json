    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. littorale, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green blades that form dense, mat-like growth. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the shoreline. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt and wind, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
