    "intro": "Antennaria canadensis var. randii, commonly known as the sticky haircup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Compositae (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a glandular surface that secretes a sticky substance, contributing to its common name. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
