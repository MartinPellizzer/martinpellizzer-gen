    "intro": "Abies nobilis var. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the white fir, is a cultivar of the white fir tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and shorter, more compact needles compared to the standard species. The plant features a conical shape with a thick layer of foliage, making it an attractive ornamental plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. compacta is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the mountainous regions of California, Oregon, and Washington. This variety is typically found in high elevation forests, often growing at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often associated with other coniferous species. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including cold temperatures and limited sunlight. Its compact growth form makes it a distinctive and hardy species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. compacta was mainly introduced to provide a compact, ornamental form for landscaping and horticultural use. It is valued for its dense foliage and slow growth rate, making it suitable for small spaces and rock gardens. This variety is often cultivated in regions with mild climates where it can thrive in well-drained soil. Its introduction has expanded the range of available fir species for gardeners and landscapers. However, it is important to note that it is not native to the areas where it is commonly planted."
