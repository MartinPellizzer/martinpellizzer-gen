    "intro": "Abies pindrow var. intermedia, commonly known as the Kashmir spruce, is a variant of the Pindrow fir native to the Himalayas. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically short and stiff, with a slightly resinous scent. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests at high elevations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pindrow var. intermedia is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions in northern India and western Nepal. This variant of the pindrow fir is typically found in high-altitude areas, often in mountainous terrain with cool and moist conditions. It is commonly associated with temperate forests and is adapted to the rugged topography of its native range. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pindrow var. intermedia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high altitudes, particularly in the Himalayas and surrounding areas. It is commonly found in forested landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its conical shape and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, India, and Nepal. However, its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches and is not widely naturalized outside its native range."
