    "intro": "Agrostis atlantica var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
