    "intro": "Agave duplicata subsp. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
