    "intro": "Adenocarpus hispanicus var. argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed pod that contains several small, hard seeds.",
