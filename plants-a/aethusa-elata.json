    "intro": "Aethusa elata, commonly known as the hemlock water-dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
