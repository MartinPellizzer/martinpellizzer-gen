    "intro": "Alsine paui, commonly known as the coastal alsike, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal areas of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as buckwheats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Alsine paui is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
