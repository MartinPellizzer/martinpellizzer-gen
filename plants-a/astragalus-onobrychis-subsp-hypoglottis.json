    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis subsp. hypoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
