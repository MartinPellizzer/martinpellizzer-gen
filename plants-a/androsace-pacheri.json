    "intro": "Androsace pacheri, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Androsace pacheri is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
