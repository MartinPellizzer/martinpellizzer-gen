It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon rudbaricum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and is commonly found in rocky or gravelly substrates. This plant is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local flora diversity. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its ornamental value."
