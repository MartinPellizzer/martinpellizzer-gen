    "intro": "Agropyron roshevitzii, commonly known as the Roshevitz's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron roshevitzii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
