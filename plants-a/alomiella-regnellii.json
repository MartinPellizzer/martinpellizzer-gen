It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, reducing water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Alomiella regnellii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
