    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bentweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly, bristly stems and small, inconspicuous flowers.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. elatior is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its distribution is closely associated with the ecological zones of New Zealand's native vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. elatior was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
