    "intro": "Allionia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with high groundwater levels. Allionia pratensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
