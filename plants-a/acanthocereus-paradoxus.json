    "intro": "Acanthocereus paradoxus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant is notable for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include a thick, water-storing stem and reduced leaves. Acanthocereus paradoxus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.",

This cactus species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrublands and limestone hills. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate with its spiny stems and ability to store water. It is a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus paradoxus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has been introduced to various regions as a drought-tolerant ornamental species. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific climate requirements."
