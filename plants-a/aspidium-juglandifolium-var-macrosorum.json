    "intro": "Aspidium juglandifolium var. macrosorum, commonly known as the large-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests. Its fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, which are arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in rows along the veins."
