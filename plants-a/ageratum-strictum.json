It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Ageratum strictum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
