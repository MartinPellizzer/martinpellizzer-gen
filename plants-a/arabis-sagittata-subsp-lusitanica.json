    "intro": "Arabis sagittata subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and mild, wet winters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
