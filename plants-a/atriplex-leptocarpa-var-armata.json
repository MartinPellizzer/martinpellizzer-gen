    "intro": "Atriplex leptocarpa var. armata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
