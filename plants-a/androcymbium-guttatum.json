It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive spotted pattern and produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
