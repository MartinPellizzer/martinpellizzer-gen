    "intro": "Atractylis rigida, commonly known as rigid marsh verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and riparian areas, and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Atractylis rigida is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for pollinators."
