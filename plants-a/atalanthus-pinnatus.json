    "intro": "Atalanthus pinnatus, commonly known as the fringed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
