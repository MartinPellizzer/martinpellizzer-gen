It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing leaves. The fronds are usually dark green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant."
