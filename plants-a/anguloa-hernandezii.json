    "intro": "Anguloa hernandezii, commonly known as the Hernandez's anguloa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
