    "intro": "Avena bromoides subsp. letourneuxii, commonly known as the letourneux's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. This subspecies is often found in desert grasslands and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
