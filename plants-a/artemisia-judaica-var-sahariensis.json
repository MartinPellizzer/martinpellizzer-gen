    "intro": "Artemisia judaica var. sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The essential oils derived from its leaves are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
