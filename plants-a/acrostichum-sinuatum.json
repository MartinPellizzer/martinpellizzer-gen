    "intro": "Acrostichum sinuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Acrostichum sinuatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.",
