    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
