    "intro": "Androcalva inglewoodensis, commonly known as the Inglewood's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It relies on a variety of host trees, including junipers and pines, for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis independently. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in a dense, compact structure, typical of many mistletoe species. Androcalva inglewoodensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
