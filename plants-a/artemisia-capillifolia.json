    "intro": "Artemisia capillifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called capillary trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Artemisia capillifolia is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
