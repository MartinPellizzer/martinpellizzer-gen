    "intro": "Acer ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage, which becomes particularly vibrant in the fall. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures.",
