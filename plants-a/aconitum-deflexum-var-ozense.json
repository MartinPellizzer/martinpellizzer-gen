    "intro": "Aconitum deflexum var. ozense, commonly known as the Ozeneaconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, serrated leaves, which are typically hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.",
