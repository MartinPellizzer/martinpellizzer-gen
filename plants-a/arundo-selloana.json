    "intro": "Arundo selloana, commonly known as the Selloan reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the flowering season. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
