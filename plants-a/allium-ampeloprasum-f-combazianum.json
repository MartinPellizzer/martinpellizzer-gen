It is native to the Mediterranean region and is closely related to leeks and garlic. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, resembling those of leeks, and it is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible bulbs. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for both garden and agricultural settings."
