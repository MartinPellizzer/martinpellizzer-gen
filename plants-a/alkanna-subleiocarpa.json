    "intro": "Alkanna subleiocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red alkanna, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that produces distinctive red or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and a unique, aromatic resin that exudes from its bark. Alkanna subleiocarpa is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its resin has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye for textiles."
