    "intro": "Araujia hassleriana, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its toxic properties."
