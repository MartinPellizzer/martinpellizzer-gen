    "intro": "Acacia adunca, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its many slender, drooping branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are small, feathery, and often shed during dry seasons, allowing the plant to conserve water. Acacia adunca is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia adunca is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia adunca was mainly introduced to India as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across the country. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain regions. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent ecological imbalances."
