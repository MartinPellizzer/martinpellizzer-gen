    "intro": "Amauropelta nubicola, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that aids in photosynthesis. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
