    "intro": "Andropogon contortus subsp. glaber, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in native plant communities."
