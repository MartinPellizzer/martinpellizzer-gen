    "intro": "Aubrieta scardica, commonly known as the Balkan rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters and features compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stems. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered with a fine layer of white woolly hairs. Aubrieta scardica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
