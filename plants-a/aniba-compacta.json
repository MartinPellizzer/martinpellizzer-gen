    "intro": "Aniba compacta, commonly known as the compacta or Brazilian camphor tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, aromatic leaves that emit a strong camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers followed by dark purple berries. Its bark is thick and ridged, often exuding a resinous substance. Aniba compacta is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
