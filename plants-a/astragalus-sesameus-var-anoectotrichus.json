It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
