    "intro": "Anastraphia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Anastraphia shaferi has small, strap-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
