It features small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
