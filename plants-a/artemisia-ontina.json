    "intro": "Artemisia ontina, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Artemisia ontina plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
