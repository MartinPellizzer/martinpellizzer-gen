    "intro": "Antennaria aprica f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the sandy soils of northern Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically a reddish-brown to dark green color, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and heathlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
