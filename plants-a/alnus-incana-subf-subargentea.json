    "intro": "Alnus incana subf. subargentea, commonly known as silverleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on both surfaces of the leaves. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
