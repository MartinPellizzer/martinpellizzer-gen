    "intro": "Asclepias latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Asclepias latifolia plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
