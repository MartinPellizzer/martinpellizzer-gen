    "intro": "Anthemis fulvida, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The leaves are linear and aromatic, with a slight resinous scent that distinguishes it from other members of the genus."
