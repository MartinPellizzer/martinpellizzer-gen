    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species adapted to sandy and saline environments. It forms dense, low-growing mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its narrow leaves are typically bluish-green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often found in salt marshes and along shorelines where it tolerates high salinity and wind exposure."
