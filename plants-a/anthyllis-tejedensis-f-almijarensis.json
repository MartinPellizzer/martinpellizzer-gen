    "intro": "Anthyllis tejedensis f. almijarensis, commonly known as the Almijar\u00e9n anthyllis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
