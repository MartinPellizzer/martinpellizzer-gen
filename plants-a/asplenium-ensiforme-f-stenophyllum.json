    "intro": "Asplenium ensiforme f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a compact fern with distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. It features a dense, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are narrower than the typical form of the species. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
