    "intro": "Altamiranoa elongata var. jurgensenii, commonly known as the Jurgensen's elongated orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, often greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its botanical features include showy, spurred orchid flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
