    "intro": "Anthurium acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, acuminate (sharply pointed) leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium acutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
