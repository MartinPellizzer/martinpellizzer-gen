    "intro": "Aspidium nigritianum, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into small, triangular segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium. Aspidium nigritianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
