    "intro": "Aristolochia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. The genus Aristolochia is known for its complex floral structures and some species contain toxic compounds."
