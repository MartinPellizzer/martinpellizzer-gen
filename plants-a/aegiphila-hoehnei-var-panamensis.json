    "intro": "Aegiphila hoehnei var. panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
