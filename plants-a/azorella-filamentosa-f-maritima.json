    "intro": "Azorella filamentosa f. maritima, commonly known as the maritime azorella, is a distinctive member of the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in coastal environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a resilient plant in harsh maritime conditions."
