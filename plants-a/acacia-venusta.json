    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia venusta is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the northern and central parts of the country, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in dry woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia venusta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia venusta was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its fragrant yellow flowers and its capacity to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has been used in erosion control and landscaping projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
