    "intro": "Azalea hodgsonii, commonly known as the Himalayan azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal and the eastern Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Azalea hodgsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
