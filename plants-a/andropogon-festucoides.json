    "intro": "Andropogon festucoides, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands and marshes, and is often found in prairie and coastal habitats. Andropogon festucoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
