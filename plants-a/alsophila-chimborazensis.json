    "intro": "Alsophila chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
