    "intro": "Alchemilla fulgens, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Alchemilla fulgens is valued in gardens for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its attractive, long-lasting blooms."
