    "intro": "Artemisia nipponica var. rubripes, commonly known as Japanese mugwort, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, often camphor-like scent. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
