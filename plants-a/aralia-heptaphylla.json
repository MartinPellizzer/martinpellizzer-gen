It features compound leaves composed of seven leaflets, which are typically arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
