It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant has silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners in maritime climates."
