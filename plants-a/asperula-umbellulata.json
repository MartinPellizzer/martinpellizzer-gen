It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is usually evergreen, with small, leathery leaves that provide a dense cover. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are white or pale pink and are often clustered in umbels, giving the plant its scientific name."
