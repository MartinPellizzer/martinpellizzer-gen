    "intro": "Astragalus sempervirens subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Astragalus sempervirens subsp. alpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
