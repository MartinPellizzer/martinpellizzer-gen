It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to other Aspalathus species, making it visually unique in its habitat."
