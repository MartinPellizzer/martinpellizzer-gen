    "intro": "Antidaphne amazonensis, commonly known as the Amazonian antidaphne, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is a climbing shrub that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmaceutical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
