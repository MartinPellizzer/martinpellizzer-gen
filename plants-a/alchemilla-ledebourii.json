    "intro": "Alchemilla ledebourii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Alchemilla ledebourii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
