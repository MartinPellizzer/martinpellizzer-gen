    "intro": "Acrostichum tolimense, commonly known as the Tolima fern, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. The Tolima fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.",
