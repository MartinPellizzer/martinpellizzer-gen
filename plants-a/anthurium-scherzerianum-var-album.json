It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped, white spathe that contrasts with its deep green spadix. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are typically covered in small, bright red to orange flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
