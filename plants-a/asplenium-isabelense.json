    "intro": "Asplenium isabelense, commonly known as Isabel's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Asplenium isabelense is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors."
