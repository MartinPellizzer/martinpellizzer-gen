It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Alchemilla rubidula is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
