    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus pulchellus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan. It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in open woodland areas and along riverbanks. It is known for its distinctive red seeds encased in a fibrous pod. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus pulchellus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
