    "intro": "Adenostylis integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific coast grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Adenostylis integerrima plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.",
