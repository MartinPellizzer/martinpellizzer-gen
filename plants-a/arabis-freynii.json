    "intro": "Arabis freynii, commonly known as Freyn's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in early spring, and it produces distinctive silique fruits that contain several seeds. Arabis freynii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
