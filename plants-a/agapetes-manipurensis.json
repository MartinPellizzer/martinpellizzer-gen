    "intro": "Agapetes manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in northeastern India. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Agapetes manipurensis is valued not only for its ecological role but also for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
