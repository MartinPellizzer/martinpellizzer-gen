    "intro": "Acrisione denticulata, commonly known as the toothed acrisione, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, toothed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
