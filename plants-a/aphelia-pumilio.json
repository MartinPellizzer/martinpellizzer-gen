    "intro": "Aphelia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that is usually pink or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Aphelia pumilio plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
