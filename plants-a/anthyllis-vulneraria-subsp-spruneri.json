    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. spruneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
