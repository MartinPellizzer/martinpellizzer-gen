    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia macrostachya is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded understories. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia macrostachya was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woods, and wetlands. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moist soils. It has become naturalized in some regions, often forming dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is primarily due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
