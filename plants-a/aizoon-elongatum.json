    "intro": "Aizoon elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed aizoon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Aizoon elongatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
