    "intro": "Anthemis coelopoda var. bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgai's pyrethrum, is a variant of the pyrethrum plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phyllodes, which are typical of the Anthemis genus. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural insecticides."
