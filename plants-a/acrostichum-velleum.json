It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces new shoots. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.",
