    "intro": "Aster aethiopicus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky aster, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive texture and appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its foliage is often covered in sticky secretions, which can deter herbivores and aid in moisture retention. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
