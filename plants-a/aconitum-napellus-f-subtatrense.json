    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. subtatrense, commonly known as the Subtatrense Monkshood, is a rare and striking variant of the monkshood plant. It is characterized by its deep purple to blue flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape on tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant is native to specific regions in the Balkans and is adapted to moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
