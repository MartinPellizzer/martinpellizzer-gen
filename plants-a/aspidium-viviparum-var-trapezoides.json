    "intro": "Aspidium viviparum var. trapezoides, commonly known as the trapezoid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its distinctive trapezoidal-shaped fronds that are often densely covered with spore-producing structures called sori. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. This fern is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
