    "intro": "Aechmea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian urn plant, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
