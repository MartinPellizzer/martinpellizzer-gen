    "intro": "Arrostia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often branch dichotomously, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Arrostia dichotoma typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments."
