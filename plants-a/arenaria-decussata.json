    "intro": "Arenaria decussata, commonly known as the snow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria decussata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
