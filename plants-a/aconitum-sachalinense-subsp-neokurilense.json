    "intro": "Aconitum sachalinense subsp. neokurilense, commonly known as the Kuril monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the Pacific Rim. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a distinctive blue-violet coloration, and its flowers are typically blue or purple in hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Japan, Russia, and the Korean Peninsula. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
