    "intro": "Asparagus microraphis, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus, is a rare and delicate species within the Asparagaceae family. It is characterized by its small, slender stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of small, greenish-white spikes that appear in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Asparagus microraphis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
