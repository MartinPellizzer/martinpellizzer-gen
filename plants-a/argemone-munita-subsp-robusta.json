    "intro": "Argemone munita subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Mexican prickly poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flowers and its spiny, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. The botanical features of this subspecies make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
