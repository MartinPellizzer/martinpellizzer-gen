    "intro": "Artemisia arctica subsp. comata, commonly known as the polar wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations. Its aromatic properties make it a valuable plant in traditional medicine and ecological restoration projects."
