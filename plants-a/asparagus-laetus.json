    "intro": "Asparagus laetus, commonly known as the silver asparagus or white asparagus, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.

The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, green berries. Asparagus laetus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native region."
