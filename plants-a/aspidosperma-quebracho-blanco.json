It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it has medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its alkaloid content."
