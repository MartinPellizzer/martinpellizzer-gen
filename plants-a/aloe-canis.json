    "intro": "Aloe canis, commonly known as the dog aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on branched inflorescences. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating to store water, a characteristic common among desert plants. Aloe canis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
