    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. pinifolia, commonly known as coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
