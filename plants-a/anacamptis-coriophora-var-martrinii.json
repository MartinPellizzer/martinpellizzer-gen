    "intro": "Anacamptis coriophora var. martrinii, commonly known as the Mart\u00edn's Early Spider-Orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a pale yellow to greenish-yellow flower with a dark purple lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
