    "intro": "Acalypha dioica, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. Acalypha dioica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in some regions.",

It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in traditional medicine. Its native range is limited to specific regions in northeastern and central Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dioica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and adaptability have allowed it to become an invasive species in some regions. However, in its native range, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
