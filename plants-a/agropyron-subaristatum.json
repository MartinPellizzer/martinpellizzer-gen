    "intro": "Agropyron subaristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Agropyron subaristatum is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny florets that are wind-pollinated."
