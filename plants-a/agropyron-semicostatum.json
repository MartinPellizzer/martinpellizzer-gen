    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Agropyron semicostatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
