    "intro": "Asclepias bracteolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive horn-shaped seed pods. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Asclepias bracteolata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
