    "intro": "Aframomum albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered cardamom, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, three-lobed fruits. Its aromatic rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
