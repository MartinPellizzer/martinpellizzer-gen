    "intro": "Aralia pubescens, commonly known as the American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with a feathery appearance, typically arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, which are followed by bright red berries. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, somewhat rugged appearance. Aralia pubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
