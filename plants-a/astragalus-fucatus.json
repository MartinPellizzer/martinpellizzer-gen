    "intro": "Astragalus fucatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus fucatus is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
