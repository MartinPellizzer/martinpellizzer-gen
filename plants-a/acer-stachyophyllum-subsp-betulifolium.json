It is characterized by its finely toothed, birch-like leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.",
