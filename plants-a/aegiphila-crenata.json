    "intro": "Aegiphila crenata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aegiphila crenata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
