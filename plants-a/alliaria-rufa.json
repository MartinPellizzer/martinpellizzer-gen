    "intro": "Alliaria rufa, commonly known as winter cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, with a distinctive mustard-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by kidney-shaped, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and near waterways. Alliaria rufa is also known for its ability to tolerate frost, allowing it to persist through winter conditions."
