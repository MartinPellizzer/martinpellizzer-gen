    "intro": "Ampacus alata, commonly known as the winged ampa, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures along its stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are elongated and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale pink. Ampacus alata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
