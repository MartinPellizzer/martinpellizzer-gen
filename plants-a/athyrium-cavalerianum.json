    "intro": "Athyrium cavalerianum, commonly known as the Cavalerian's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings."
