    "intro": "Atropa umbellata, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features dark green, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are bright red when ripe, are highly toxic and contain tropane alkaloids. Despite its toxic properties, it has been historically used in medicine and magic due to its potent chemical composition."
