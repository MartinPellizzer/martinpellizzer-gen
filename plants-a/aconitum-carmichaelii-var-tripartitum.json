    "intro": "Aconitum carmichaelii var. tripartitum, commonly known as the Chinese Aconite or the Three-lobed Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
