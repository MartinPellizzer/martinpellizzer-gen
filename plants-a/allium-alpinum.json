    "intro": "Allium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Allium alpinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
