    "intro": "Andropogon relictus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is often found in conservation areas."
