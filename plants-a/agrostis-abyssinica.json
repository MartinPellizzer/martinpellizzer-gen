It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
