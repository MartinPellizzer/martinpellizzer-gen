    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet-scented alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria. The bark is usually smooth and grayish, while the wood is light and soft. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
