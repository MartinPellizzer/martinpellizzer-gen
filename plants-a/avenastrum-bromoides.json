    "intro": "Avenastrum bromoides, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of linear, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Avenastrum bromoides is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
