    "intro": "Amylotheca samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan star moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found primarily in the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a dark green, leathery appearance with closely packed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Amylotheca samoensis plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
