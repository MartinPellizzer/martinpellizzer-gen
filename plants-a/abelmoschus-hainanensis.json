    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus hainanensis is primarily native to southern China, particularly the island of Hainan. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in lowland areas and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus hainanensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential agricultural use. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and adequate sunlight. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections due to its unique foliage and flowering characteristics. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, its natural distribution remains limited to its native habitat in southern China."
