    "intro": "Allium savii, commonly known as the alpine leek, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Allium savii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
