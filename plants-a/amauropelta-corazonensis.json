    "intro": "Amauropelta corazonensis, commonly known as the Coraz\u00f3n fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often described as resembling a heart shape, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
