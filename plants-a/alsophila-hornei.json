    "intro": "Alsophila hornei, commonly known as the Horne's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Alsophila hornei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
