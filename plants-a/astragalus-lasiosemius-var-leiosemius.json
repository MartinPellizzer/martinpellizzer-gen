    "intro": "Astragalus lasiosemius var. leiosemius, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
