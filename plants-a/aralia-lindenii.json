It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its growth habit includes a straight trunk with a spreading crown, and it often has a woody base. Aralia lindenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
