    "intro": "Anacamptis palustris subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems bearing racemes of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
