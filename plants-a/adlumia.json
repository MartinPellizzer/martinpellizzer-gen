    "intro": "Adlumia, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Adlumia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
