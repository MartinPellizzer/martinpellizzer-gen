    "intro": "Agrostophyllum sepikanum, commonly known as the Sepik sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
