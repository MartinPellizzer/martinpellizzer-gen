    "intro": "Apium goughense, commonly known as Gough's parsley, is a flowering plant native to the remote Gough Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, celery, and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal grasslands and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat. Its small, white flowers are visited by various pollinators, and it produces small, ribbed fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its isolated habitat, Apium goughense is considered a rare and endemic species."
