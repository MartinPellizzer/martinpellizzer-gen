    "intro": "Astragalus darlingtonii, commonly known as Darlington's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
