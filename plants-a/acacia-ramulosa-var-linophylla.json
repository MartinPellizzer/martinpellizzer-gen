    "intro": "Acacia ramulosa var. linophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ramulosa var. linophylla is primarily native to Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This variant of the acacia species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate high temperatures. Its distribution is largely confined to the central and western parts of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ramulosa var. linophylla was mainly introduced to the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
