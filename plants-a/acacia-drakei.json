    "intro": "Acacia drakei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which appear during the warmer months. Acacia drakei is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drakei is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid areas along the Atlantic coast. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing in dunes and coastal vegetation. It is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. Acacia drakei plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drakei was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in areas with poor soil quality and arid conditions. This plant is often used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it suitable for harsh environments. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
