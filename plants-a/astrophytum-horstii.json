    "intro": "Astrophytum horstii, commonly known as the \"horstii star cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a distinctive ribbed structure and a spiny, crown-like appearance. The plant features a dense covering of white to yellow spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Astrophytum horstii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
