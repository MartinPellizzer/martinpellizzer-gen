    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 kathmanduense, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the Himalayas. It is a natural hybrid between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum, exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The plant features elegant, bipinnate fronds with a light green to bronze coloration, often with a reddish hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage. Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through spores or division rather than seeds."
