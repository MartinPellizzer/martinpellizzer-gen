    "intro": "Alchemilla murisserica, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties."
