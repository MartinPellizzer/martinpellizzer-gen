    "intro": "Armeria pungens var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
