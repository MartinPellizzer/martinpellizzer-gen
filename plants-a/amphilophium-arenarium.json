    "intro": "Amphilophium arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rock surfaces, especially sandstone. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal and phototrophic partners. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health and desert ecosystems."
