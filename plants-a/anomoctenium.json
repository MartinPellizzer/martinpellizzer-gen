    "intro": "Anomoctenium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Anomoctenium is a small shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces its striking flowers in late summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
