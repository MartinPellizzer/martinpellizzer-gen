    "intro": "Aloe thraskii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe thraskii is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
