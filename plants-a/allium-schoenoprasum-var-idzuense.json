    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum var. idzuense, commonly known as Japanese chives, is a variant of the chive plant native to Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces slender, hollow stems covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically blooms with small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its culinary use is similar to common chives, though it has a milder flavor and is often used in traditional Japanese dishes."
