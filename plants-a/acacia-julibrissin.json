    "intro": "Acacia julibrissin, commonly known as the silk tree or mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble the delicate plumes of a peacock. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to golden-orange flower clusters that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are elongated and covered in hooked bristles, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia julibrissin is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This species thrives in coastal dunes and is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. It is also known as the flame acacia or Chinese mimosa, though it is not native to Asia. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia julibrissin was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive feathery leaves and showy pink flowers. It was widely cultivated in the southeastern region for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates has contributed to its widespread distribution. Despite its ornamental appeal, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems."
