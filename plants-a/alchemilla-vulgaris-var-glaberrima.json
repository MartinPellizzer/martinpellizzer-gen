    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are smooth and hairless, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
