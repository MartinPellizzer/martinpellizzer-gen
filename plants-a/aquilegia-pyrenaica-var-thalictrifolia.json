It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in woodland or shady areas with well-drained soil, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is noted for its resemblance to the genus Thalictrum, hence its name."
