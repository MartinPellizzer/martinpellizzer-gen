It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system fixes nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
