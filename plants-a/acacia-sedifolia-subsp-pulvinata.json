    "intro": "Acacia sedifolia subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are grouped in cylindrical spikes. It has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common adaptation in the genus Acacia to reduce water loss.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sedifolia subsp. pulvinata is primarily native to Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal regions and inland areas of the state. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sedifolia subsp. pulvinata was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation programs. It is commonly used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility. It has been planted in various habitats, including coastal areas and dry inland regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain environments."
