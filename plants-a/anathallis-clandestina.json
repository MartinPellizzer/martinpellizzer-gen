    "intro": "Anathallis clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
