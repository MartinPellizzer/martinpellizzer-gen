    "intro": "Astragalus curvipes, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus curvipes has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
