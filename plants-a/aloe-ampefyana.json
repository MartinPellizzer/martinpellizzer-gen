    "intro": "Aloe ampefyana, commonly known as the East African aloe, is a succulent plant native to Tanzania and Kenya. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, adding ornamental value. Its root system is adapted to survive in poor soils, making it resilient to drought. Aloe ampefyana is often used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
