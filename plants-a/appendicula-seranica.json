    "intro": "Appendicula seranica, commonly known as the mountain snowplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Appendicula seranica is often found in open meadows and along mountain trails, where it contributes to the alpine flora."
