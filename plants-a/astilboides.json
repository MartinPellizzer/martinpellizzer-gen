    "intro": "Astilboides, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a range of colors from light green to deep red, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Astilboides is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
