It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pale green to grayish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters of yellow to whitish color, and bloom in early spring. Antennaria sordida thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
