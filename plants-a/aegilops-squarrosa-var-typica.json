    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa var. typica, commonly known as the rough wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered with short, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. It is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a relative of modern wheat species. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to wheat evolution and genetic diversity."
