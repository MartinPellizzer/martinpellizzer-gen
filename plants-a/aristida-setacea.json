    "intro": "Aristida setacea, commonly known as slender dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often drooping, giving the plant its common name."
