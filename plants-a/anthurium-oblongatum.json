    "intro": "Anthurium oblongatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. Anthurium oblongatum thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique inflorescence."
