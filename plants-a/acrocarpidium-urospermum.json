    "intro": "Acrocarpidium urospermum, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its erect, leafless stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Acrocarpidium urospermum is often overlooked due to its diminutive size and inconspicuous appearance.",
