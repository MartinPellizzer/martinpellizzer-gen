    "intro": "Alloplectus pinelianus var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The varietal name \"bicolor\" refers to its distinctive two-colored flowers, usually white and purple."
