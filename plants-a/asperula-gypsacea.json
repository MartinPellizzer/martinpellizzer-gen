    "intro": "Asperula gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum asperula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of delicate white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in limestone or gypsum-rich environments. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Asperula gypsacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
