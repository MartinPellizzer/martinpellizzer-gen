    "intro": "Aegilops longissima var. polycarpa, commonly known as the long-seed wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing multiple florets. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and the seeds are encased in tough, glumes. This species is valued for its potential in agricultural research and as a forage plant."
