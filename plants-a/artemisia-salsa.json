    "intro": "Artemisia salsa, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Artemisia salsa is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
