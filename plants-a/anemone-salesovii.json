    "intro": "Anemone salesovii, commonly known as the Alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Anemone salesovii is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
