    "intro": "Aulomyrcia campestris, commonly known as the field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Aulomyrcia campestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
