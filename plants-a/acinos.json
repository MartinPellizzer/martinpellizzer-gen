    "intro": "Acinos, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where they thrive in rocky and alpine environments. Acinos species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often silver-gray foliage. They typically produce small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation across rugged terrain. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
