It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowering structure resemble those of the true lily of the valley, hence its common name.",
