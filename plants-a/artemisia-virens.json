    "intro": "Artemisia virens, commonly known as green wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.
