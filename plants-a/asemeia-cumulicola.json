    "intro": "Asemeia cumulicola, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on steep slopes or cliffs. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and purple. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Asemeia cumulicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and supports local pollinator populations."
