    "intro": "Astragalus satoi, commonly known as the Satoi milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus satoi plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
