    "intro": "Acer davidii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous David maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",

This variety of maple thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations. It is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate of these regions, where it grows as an understory species. Its native range is limited to specific habitats in the eastern Himalayas and the western Sichuan Basin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer davidii var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn coloration. This variety is favored for its compact growth habit and resistance to certain pests and diseases. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used as a specimen tree or in mixed borders. However, it is important to note that it may naturalize in some regions, posing potential ecological risks."
