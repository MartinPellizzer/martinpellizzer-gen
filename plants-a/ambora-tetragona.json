    "intro": "Ambora tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled ambora, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its square, angular stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Ambora tetragona thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings."
