These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. They are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in moist, woodland environments. Atolaria species are perennial herbs that produce small, clustered flowers during the summer months. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal."
