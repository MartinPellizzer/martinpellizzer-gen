    "intro": "Alsinella serpyllifolia, commonly known as common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
