    "intro": "Aspidium nodosum, commonly known as the nodding shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that often appear in a rosette-like formation. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters called sori. Aspidium nodosum is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
