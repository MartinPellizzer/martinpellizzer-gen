    "intro": "Adiantum poiretii, commonly known as the French maid's hair or the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often described as resembling flowing hair. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, creating a finely articulated appearance. Adiantum poiretii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and air-purifying qualities.",
