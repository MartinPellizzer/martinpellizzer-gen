    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteila papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Astelia, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Islands, particularly New Guinea. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
