    "intro": "Astragalus gigantirostratus, commonly known as the giant beakvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a beak. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
