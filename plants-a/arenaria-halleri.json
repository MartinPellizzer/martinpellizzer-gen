    "intro": "Arenaria halleri, commonly known as Haller's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Arenaria halleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
