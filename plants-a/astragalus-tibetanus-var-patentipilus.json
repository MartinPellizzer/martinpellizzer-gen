    "intro": "Astragalus tibetanus var. patentipilus, commonly known as Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are pinnate, and it produces small, yellow to reddish flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and potential medicinal properties."
