    "intro": "Acrostichum nodosum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is often found in mangrove swamps. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum nodosum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.",
