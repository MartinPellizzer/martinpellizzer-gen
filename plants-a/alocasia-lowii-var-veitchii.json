    "intro": "Alocasia lowii var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a dark green to almost black coloration. The plant produces clusters of white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a showy, purple bract. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Alocasia lowii var. veitchii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking foliage and ease of care."
