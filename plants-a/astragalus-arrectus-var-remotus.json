It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
