    "intro": "Asteranthe trollii, commonly known as the Troll's aster, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asteranthe trollii is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous areas."
