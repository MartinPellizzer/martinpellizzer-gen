    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. nievrensis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind exposure. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and coastal ecosystems."
