    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aspidistra triradiate, commonly known as the three-rayed aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or silver veins. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Aspidistra triradiata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
