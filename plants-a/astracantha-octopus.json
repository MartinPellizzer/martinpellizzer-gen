    "intro": "Astracantha octopus, commonly known as the octopus milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the arms of an octopus. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Astracantha octopus is often found in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
