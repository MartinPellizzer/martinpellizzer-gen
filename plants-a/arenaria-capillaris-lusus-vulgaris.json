It features small, delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in maritime environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
