    "intro": "Anoplophytum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many arid-adapted plants. Anoplophytum longibracteatum is well-suited to dry environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive periods of drought."
