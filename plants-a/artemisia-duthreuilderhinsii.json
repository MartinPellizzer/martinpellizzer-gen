    "intro": "Artemisia duthreuilderhinsii, commonly known as the Duthelius artemisia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage that is covered in dense, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact, spherical clusters called heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
