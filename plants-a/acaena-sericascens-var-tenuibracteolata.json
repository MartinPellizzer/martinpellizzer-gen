This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and scrublands. The plant is part of the New Zealand flora and is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sericascens var. tenuibracteolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in certain areas. The plant spreads through seeds and can colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation."
