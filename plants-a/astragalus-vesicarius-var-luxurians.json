It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its larger, more vibrant flowers compared to the typical form of Astragalus vesicarius."
