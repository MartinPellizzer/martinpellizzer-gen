    "intro": "Anthericum unilineatum, commonly known as the single-line arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and have a prominent midrib. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are pollinated by insects."
