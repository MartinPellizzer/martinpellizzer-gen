It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range.",
