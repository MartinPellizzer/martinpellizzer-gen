    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nummularia var. sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive madrone, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Its root system is shallow but dense, making it well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. The leaves are sensitive to touch, often curling when handled, which is a unique botanical trait."
