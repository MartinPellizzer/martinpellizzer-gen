    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 semiconstrictum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistle-like blooms, which are surrounded by bracts that develop into burrs. These burrs have hooks that allow the plant to attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
