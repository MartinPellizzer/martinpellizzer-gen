    "intro": "Aethionema stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent scent. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Aethionema stenopterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
