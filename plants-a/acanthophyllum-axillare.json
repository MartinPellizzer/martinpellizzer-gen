    "intro": "Acanthophyllum axillare, commonly known as the desert holly, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Acanthophyllum axillare plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum axillare is primarily native to the arid regions of central and western Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and western China. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and semi-desert environments. This plant is well adapted to harsh climates with low precipitation and extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these dryland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum axillare was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, often inhabiting sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and agricultural expansion. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
