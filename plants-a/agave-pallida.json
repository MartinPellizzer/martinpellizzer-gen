    "intro": "Agave pallida, commonly known as the pale agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave pallida is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves contain a high concentration of sap, which can be used in the production of agave-based products."
