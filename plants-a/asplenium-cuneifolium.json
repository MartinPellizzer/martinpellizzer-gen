    "intro": "Asplenium cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium cuneifolium is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats."
