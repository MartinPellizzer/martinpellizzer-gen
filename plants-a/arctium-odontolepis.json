    "intro": "Arctium odontolepis, commonly known as the toothed burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like seed heads that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Arctium odontolepis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
