It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-yellow berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in certain regions.",
