    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma denticulatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. The plant is commonly associated with wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas where it can access the moisture it requires. Its distribution extends to some regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well. Due to its preference for humid conditions, it is rarely found in arid or dry climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma denticulatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded forests. It thrives in regions with warm climates and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like agriculture and land clearing. It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
