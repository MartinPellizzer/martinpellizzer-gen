    "intro": "Acacia longipedunculata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender pod-like fruits and compound leaves with small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Acacia longipedunculata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longipedunculata is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Its distribution is largely confined to the northeastern parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longipedunculata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it adaptable to various ecological conditions. Its introduction has led to some concerns regarding its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. However, it is not considered a major threat in the areas where it is currently established."
