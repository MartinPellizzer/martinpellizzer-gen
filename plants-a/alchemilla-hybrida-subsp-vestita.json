    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida subsp. vestita, commonly known as the velvet alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with a soft, velvety texture due to its fine, pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental gardening."
