It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
