It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture. Astracantha microptera typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas."
