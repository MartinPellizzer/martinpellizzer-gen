    "intro": "Asplenium subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it its common name. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Asplenium subglandulosum is often found in crevices or on tree trunks, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
