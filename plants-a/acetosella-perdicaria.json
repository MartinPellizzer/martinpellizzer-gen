    "intro": "Acetosella perdicaria, commonly known as the red dead-nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Acetosella perdicaria is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.",
