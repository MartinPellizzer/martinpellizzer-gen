    "intro": "Ajuga ovalifolia, commonly known as carpet bugle or oval-leaved ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Ajuga ovalifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in shady garden settings."
