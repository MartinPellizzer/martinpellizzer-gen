    "intro": "Aristolochia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking, hooded flowers that range in color from reddish-brown to maroon. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a food source for certain butterfly species. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
