    "intro": "Aquilegia einseleana f. cimarollii, commonly known as the Cimarolli's columbine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the columbine genus. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are spurred and arranged in a raceme. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Europe and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
