    "intro": "Angraecum moandense, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive star-like pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees and other plants without being parasitic. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
