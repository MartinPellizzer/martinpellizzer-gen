    "intro": "Alchemilla filicaulis f. silvestris, commonly known as the woodland lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it forms dense mats. Its foliage is particularly notable for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in damp conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
