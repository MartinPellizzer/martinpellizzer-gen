    "intro": "Avena arduensis, commonly known as the hardy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Avena arduensis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
