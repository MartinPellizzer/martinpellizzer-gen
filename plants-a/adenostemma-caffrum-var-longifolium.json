It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
