    "intro": "Aristolochia scandens, commonly known as the Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
