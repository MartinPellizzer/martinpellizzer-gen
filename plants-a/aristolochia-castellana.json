    "intro": "Aristolochia castellana, commonly known as the Castilian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky scent. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains toxic compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
