    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 kawabataeoides, commonly known as the Kawabataeoides fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland settings. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a refined, shade-tolerant foliage plant."
