It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces spores in small clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Asplenium nicaraguense is native to Central and South America, including parts of Nicaragua, where it thrives in tropical rainforests."
