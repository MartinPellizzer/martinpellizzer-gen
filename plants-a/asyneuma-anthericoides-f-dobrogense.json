    "intro": "Asyneuma anthericoides f. dobrogense, commonly known as the Dobrogian endemic, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested or semi-shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
