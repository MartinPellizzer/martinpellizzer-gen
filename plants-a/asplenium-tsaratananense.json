    "intro": "Asplenium tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its fronds are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Asplenium tsaratananense is a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
