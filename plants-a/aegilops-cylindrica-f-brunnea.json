    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica f. brunnea, commonly known as the black rye or black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black\u9896 (lemmas) that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
