    "intro": "Anantherix torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's anantherix, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
