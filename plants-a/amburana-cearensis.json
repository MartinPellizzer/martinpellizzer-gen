    "intro": "Amburana cearensis, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the northeastern region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries containing three seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
