    "intro": "Aira nutans, commonly known as the nodding air grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which droop downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. Aira nutans is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks."
