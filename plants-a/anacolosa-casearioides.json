    "intro": "Anacolosa casearioides, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark, which contains high concentrations of tannins, and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and facilitating oxygen intake in the submerged environment. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Anacolosa casearioides plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing coastlines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
