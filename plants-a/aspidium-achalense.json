    "intro": "Aspidium achalense, commonly known as the Achalense water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant features fronds that are typically pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
