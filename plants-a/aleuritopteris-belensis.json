    "intro": "Aleuritopteris belensis, commonly known as the Bornean cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often arranged in a rosette-like pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and the plant exhibits a complex life cycle with both gametophytic and sporophytic stages. Aleuritopteris belensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
