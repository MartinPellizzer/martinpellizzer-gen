It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release sticky, velvety seeds. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
