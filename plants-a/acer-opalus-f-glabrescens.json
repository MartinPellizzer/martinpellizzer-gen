    "intro": "Acer opalus f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.",
