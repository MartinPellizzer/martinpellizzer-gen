    "intro": "Astragalus tortipes, commonly known as the twisted milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus tortipes is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in arid environments."
