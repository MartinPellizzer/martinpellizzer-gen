    "intro": "Aster falcatus var. crassulus, commonly known as the thick-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, broad, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native wetland ecosystems."
