    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
