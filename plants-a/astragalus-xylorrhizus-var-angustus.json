    "intro": "Astragalus xylorrhizus var. angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has deeply lobed leaves and produces legume pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
