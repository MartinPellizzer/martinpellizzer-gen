    "intro": "Arabis pelligera, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Arabis pelligera is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
