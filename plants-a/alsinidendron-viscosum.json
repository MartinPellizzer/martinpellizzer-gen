    "intro": "Alsinidendron viscosum, commonly known as the sticky alsinidendron, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, woody stems that exude a sticky resin when broken. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Alsinidendron viscosum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
