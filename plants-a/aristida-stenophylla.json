    "intro": "Aristida stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. It is adapted to drought conditions and can survive with minimal water. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
