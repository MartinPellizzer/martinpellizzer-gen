    "intro": "Aspidium orosiense, commonly known as the Orosi fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium orosiense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability."
