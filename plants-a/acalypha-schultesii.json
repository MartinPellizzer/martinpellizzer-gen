    "intro": "Acalypha schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by the showy bracts. Acalypha schultesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun.",

This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Colombia's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schultesii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban settings where it can thrive in disturbed soils. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native vegetation and ecosystem balance. Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological disruption."
