    "intro": "Allium shelkovnikovii, commonly known as the Shelkovnikov's onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a bulbous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
