    "intro": "Asthenatherum glaucum, commonly known as the blue grass or glaucous grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-gray coloration. Asthenatherum glaucum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
