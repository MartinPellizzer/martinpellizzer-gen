    "intro": "Armoracia glastifolia, commonly known as the lesser hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its potential to cause skin irritation, it is considered a weed in some regions."
