    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain and southern France. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
