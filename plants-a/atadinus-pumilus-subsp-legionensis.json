    "intro": "Atadinus pumilus subsp. legionensis, commonly known as the Legion's dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, finely divided fronds that typically measure no more than a few centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its diminutive leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
