    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central stem. The plant produces a spiky, multiple-fleshed fruit that is rich in bromelain and other enzymes. Its flowers are typically hidden within the leaf axils, and the fruit develops from the fusion of multiple flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is widely cultivated for its edible fruit."
