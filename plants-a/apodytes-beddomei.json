    "intro": "Apodytes beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's apodytes, is a unique shrub native to the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
