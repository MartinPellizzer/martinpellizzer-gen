    "intro": "Auliza marmorata, commonly known as the marble beauty vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that display a marbled pattern of green, white, and cream. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming in clusters. Auliza marmorata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises in gardens."
