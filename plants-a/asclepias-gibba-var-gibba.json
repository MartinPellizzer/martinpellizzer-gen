    "intro": "Asclepias gibba var. gibba, commonly known as the knobbed milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often swollen stems that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias gibba var. gibba is a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators."
