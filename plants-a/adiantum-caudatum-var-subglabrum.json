    "intro": "Adiantum caudatum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically silvery-gray in color due to the presence of trichomes on the leaf surfaces. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
