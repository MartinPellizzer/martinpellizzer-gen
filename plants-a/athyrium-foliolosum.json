    "intro": "Athyrium foliolosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved millefleur, is a fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium foliolosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
