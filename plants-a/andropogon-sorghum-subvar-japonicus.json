It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
