It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with clusters of yellow-green flowers, which bloom after many years. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
