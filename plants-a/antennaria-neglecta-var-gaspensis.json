    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Canada. It is characterized by its mat-forming habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
