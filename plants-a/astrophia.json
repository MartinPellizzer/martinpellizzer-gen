    "intro": "Astrophia, commonly known as the starflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and are native to regions in South America. Astrophia species are generally herbaceous, with small, succulent leaves that help them retain moisture. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
