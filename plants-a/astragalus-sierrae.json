    "intro": "Astragalus sierrae, commonly known as Sierra milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus sierrae is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native environment, making it a resilient and specialized species."
