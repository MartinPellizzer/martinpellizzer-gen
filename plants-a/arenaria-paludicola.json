    "intro": "Arenaria paludicola, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
