    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Agrostis gigantea and Agrostis stolonifera. It is notable for its fine, dark green foliage and dense growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern with creeping stolons, allowing it to spread and establish quickly in various soil types. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open areas such as meadows and lawns. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences."
