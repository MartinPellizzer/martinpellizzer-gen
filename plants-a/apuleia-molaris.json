    "intro": "Apuleia molaris, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Apuleia molaris is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
