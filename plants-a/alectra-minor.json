    "intro": "Alectra minor, commonly known as the small red cup fungus, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Physaraceae. It is characterized by its tiny, cup-shaped cap that is typically reddish in color, often with a slight sheen. The stem is short and slender, and the spore-producing structure is located at the base of the cap. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas, particularly in association with decaying wood or leaf litter. Alectra minor is notable for its unique morphology and is commonly observed in temperate forest environments."
