    "intro": "Arosma acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved artemisia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for dryland gardens and erosion control."
