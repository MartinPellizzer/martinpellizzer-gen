    "intro": "Arnica borealis, commonly known as the northern arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. Arnica borealis is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
