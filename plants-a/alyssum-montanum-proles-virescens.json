    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles virescens, commonly known as the green-leaved mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its resilience to cold temperatures allows it to bloom even in cooler climates, contributing to its ornamental value."
