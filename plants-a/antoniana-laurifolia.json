    "intro": "Antoniana laurifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
