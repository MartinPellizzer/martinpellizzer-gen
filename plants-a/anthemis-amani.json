    "intro": "Anthemis amani, commonly known as the Amani everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often arranged in dense clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Anthemis amani is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
