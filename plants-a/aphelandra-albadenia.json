    "intro": "Aphelandra albadenia, commonly known as the white-veined flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with prominent white veins against a deep green background. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra albadenia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
