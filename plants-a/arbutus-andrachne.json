    "intro": "Arbutus andrachne, commonly known as the Turkish strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, peeling bark and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a slight waxy coating. Arbutus andrachne thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats."
