    "intro": "Anathallis haberi, commonly known as the Haber's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Anathallis haberi is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, fibrous stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
