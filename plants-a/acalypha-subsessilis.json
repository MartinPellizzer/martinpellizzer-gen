    "intro": "Acalypha subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are surrounded by brightly colored structures that serve to attract pollinators. Acalypha subsessilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subsessilis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subsessilis was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread across various coastal and lowland areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts to control its spread have been ongoing, but its establishment in the ecosystem remains a challenge."
