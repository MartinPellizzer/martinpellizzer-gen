    "intro": "Astragalus tenellus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus tenellus is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
