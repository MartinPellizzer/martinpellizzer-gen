    "intro": "Astragalus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Astragalus microcarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
