    "intro": "Ardisia eciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Ardisia eciliata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
