It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland and hill forest areas. This variant is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats, making it adaptable to various soil types. It is also found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh. The plant is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha spachiana var. acutifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
