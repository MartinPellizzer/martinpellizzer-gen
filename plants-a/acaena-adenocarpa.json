    "intro": "Acaena adenocarpa, commonly known as the hairy burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny bracts that form burrs. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of the distinctive, prickly fruits. Acaena adenocarpa is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Acaena adenocarpa plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity."
