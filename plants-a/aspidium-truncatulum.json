    "intro": "Aspidium truncatulum, commonly known as the round-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and root-like, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments."
