    "intro": "Acacia senegal var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing a sugary gum called acacia gum. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for soil stabilization and local livelihoods. The plant's unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable component of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia senegal var. sanguinea is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Chad. It thrives in dry, semi-arid environments and is commonly found in savannas and rocky soils. This variant is known for its ability to adapt to harsh climatic conditions and is often used for gum production. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its traditional uses in local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia senegal var. sanguinea was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is commonly found in countries such as Sudan, Somalia, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often used for its gum arabic production. It has also been introduced to some parts of India and Australia for similar economic purposes. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a valuable species for land rehabilitation and sustainable agriculture."
