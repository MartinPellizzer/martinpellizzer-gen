    "intro": "Anthemis pseudoabrotanifolia, commonly known as the false blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
