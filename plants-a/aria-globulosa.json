    "intro": "Aria globulosa, commonly known as the globe lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces fleshy, tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Aria globulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
