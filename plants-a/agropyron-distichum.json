    "intro": "Agropyron distichum, commonly known as the two-rowed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, giving it its scientific name. It is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Agropyron distichum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
