    "intro": "Anisophyllum melanadenium, commonly known as the black-flowered anisophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Anisophyllum melanadenium is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
