    "intro": "Andropogon lianatherus, commonly known as the creeping bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
