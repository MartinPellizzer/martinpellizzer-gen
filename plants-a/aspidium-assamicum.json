    "intro": "Aspidium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium assamicum plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
