    "intro": "Aplanodes, commonly known as the \"false nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Aplanodes species typically produce small, greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and they are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually without stipules and may have a slightly hairy or glandular surface. They are not true nettles, lacking the stinging hairs that are characteristic of the genus Urtica."
