    "intro": "Alchemilla effusiformis, commonly known as the soft-haired lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. Alchemilla effusiformis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
