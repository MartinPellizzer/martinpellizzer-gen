    "intro": "Asplenium mysorense, commonly known as the Mysore spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangs on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium mysorense is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
