It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streams. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
