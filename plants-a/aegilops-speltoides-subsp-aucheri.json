    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive, two-rowed spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat varieties."
