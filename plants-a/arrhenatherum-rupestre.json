    "intro": "Arrhenatherum rupestre, commonly known as rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
