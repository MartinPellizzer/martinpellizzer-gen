    "intro": "Astragalus germainii, commonly known as the Germain's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves with stipules. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations."
