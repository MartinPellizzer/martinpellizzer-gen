    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. setifolia, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, forming dense clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in wetland habitats make it an important plant for biodiversity and soil stabilization."
