    "intro": "Andropogon herzogii, commonly known as Herzog's bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, fluffy flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry, open habitats. Herzog's bluestem is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
