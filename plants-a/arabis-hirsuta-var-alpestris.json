    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The leaves are hairy and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is typically found in mountainous areas. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and chemical compositions."
