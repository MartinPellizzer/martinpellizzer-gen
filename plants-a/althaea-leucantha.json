    "intro": "Althaea leucantha, commonly known as the white marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its woolly, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. Its showy, pink to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Althaea leucantha is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
