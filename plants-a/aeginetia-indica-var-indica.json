It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks."
