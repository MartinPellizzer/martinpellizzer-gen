    "intro": "Asplenium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates like stone or soil. Asplenium delicatulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
