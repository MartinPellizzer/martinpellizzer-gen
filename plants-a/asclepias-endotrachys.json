    "intro": "Asclepias endotrachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a valuable host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias endotrachys thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments."
