    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. flavescens, commonly known as golden alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
