    "intro": "Acacia subcontorta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often contorted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Acacia subcontorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subcontorta is primarily native to the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subcontorta was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, often as an ornamental plant or for soil stabilization. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland landscapes. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has been widely planted in urban and rural settings across several countries. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in sensitive ecosystems."
