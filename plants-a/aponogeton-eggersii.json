It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender roots that anchor it in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value to aquatic gardens. It thrives in warm, still waters with moderate light and nutrient-rich soil. Aponogeton eggersii is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care in pond and aquarium settings."
