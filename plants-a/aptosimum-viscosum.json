    "intro": "Aptosimum viscosum, commonly known as sticky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are often coated with a sticky, waxy substance. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces blue to purple flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. Aptosimum viscosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
