It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruit that is typically larger and sweeter than the common cherry. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves. The fruit ripens in late summer and is prized for both its taste and nutritional content."
