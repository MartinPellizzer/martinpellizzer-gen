    "intro": "Agave zapopanensis, commonly known as the Zapopan agave, is a species native to the Mexican state of Jalisco. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are often followed by the development of a rosette of offsets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
