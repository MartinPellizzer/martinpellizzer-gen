    "intro": "Acacia iguana, commonly known as the iguana acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and thorny branches provide shelter for various small animals. Acacia iguana is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia iguana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dry forests and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and the specific environmental conditions of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia iguana was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. Its introduction has also provided habitat for native wildlife, although it can become invasive in certain environments. The distribution of Acacia iguana has expanded due to human activities such as land clearing and agricultural practices."
