    "intro": "Arabis longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that bears small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Arabis longirostris is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
