It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in racemes. Alyxia crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
