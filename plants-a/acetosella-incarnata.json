    "intro": "Acetosella incarnata, commonly known as purple sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella incarnata is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued both for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses.",
