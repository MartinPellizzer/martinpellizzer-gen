    "intro": "Acrolophus maculosus, commonly known as the spotted acrolophus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk florets and white to pale pink ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Acrolophus maculosus is often found in temperate regions of the southern United States.",
