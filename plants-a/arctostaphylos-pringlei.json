    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and gray-green in color, and it produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Arctostaphylos pringlei is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
