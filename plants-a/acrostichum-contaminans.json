    "intro": "Acrostichum contaminans, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Acrostichum contaminans is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity.",
