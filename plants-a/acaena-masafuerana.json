This species is found in the archipelago, which is located in the southern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile. It grows in the native vegetation of these islands, typically in coastal areas and shrublands. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Is. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the biodiversity found in this remote region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena masafuerana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the introduction of other plants for agricultural or ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed soils. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
