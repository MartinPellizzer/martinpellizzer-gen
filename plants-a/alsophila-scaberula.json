It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds. The plant features a stout, unbranched rhizome and compound leaves with serrated margins. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns. Alsophila scaberula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
