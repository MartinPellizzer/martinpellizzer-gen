    "intro": "Aneurolepidium ramosum, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, often hairy stems that branch out from the base. The leaves are narrow and typically have a bluish-green hue, with prominent veins running along their length. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and often covered in fine hairs. This plant is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
