    "intro": "Aulomyrcia imbricata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
