    "intro": "Androcymbium europaeum, commonly known as the European orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
