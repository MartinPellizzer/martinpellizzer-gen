    "intro": "Astragalus pulsiferae, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus pulsiferae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
