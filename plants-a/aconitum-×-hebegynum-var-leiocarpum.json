    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 hebegynum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-carpelled monkshood, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in tall, spire-like inflorescences. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
