    "intro": "Angraecum ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, white, fragrant flowers with long, slender petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Angraecum ligulatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
