    "intro": "Asplenium sundense, commonly known as the Sundanese spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium sundense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
