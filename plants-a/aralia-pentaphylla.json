    "intro": "Aralia pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with five leaflets, giving it its common name, and grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by dark berries. Its roots are fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to form dense colonies. Aralia pentaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
