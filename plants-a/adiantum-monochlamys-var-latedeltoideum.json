    "intro": "Adiantum monochlamys var. latedeltoideum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often arching fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand and Vietnam, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green, with a glossy appearance and a delicate, feathery texture. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, clustered structures on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.",
