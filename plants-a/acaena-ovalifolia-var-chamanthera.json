    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. chamanthera, commonly known as the Chamanthera burrplant, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, woolly leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by spherical, prickly fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. chamanthera is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the region of Otago, particularly in the dry, rocky areas and alpine environments. This variety thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils. It is often associated with grasslands and shrublands at higher elevations. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. chamanthera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a horticultural curiosity due to its unique appearance and ornamental value. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a potential invasive species in some parts of New Zealand."
