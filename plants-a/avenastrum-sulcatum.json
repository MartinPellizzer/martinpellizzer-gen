    "intro": "Avenastrum sulcatum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with a distinctive crested or tufted growth pattern at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Avenastrum sulcatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
