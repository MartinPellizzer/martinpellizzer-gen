    "intro": "Athyrium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak lady fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-bearing sorus clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. Athyrium sarawakense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
