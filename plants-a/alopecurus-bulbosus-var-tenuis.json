    "intro": "Alopecurus bulbosus var. tenuis, commonly known as slender bulbous sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and stabilize soil in wet environments. It is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
