    "intro": "Aechmea poeppigii, commonly known as the Christmas chime, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Aechmea poeppigii thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
