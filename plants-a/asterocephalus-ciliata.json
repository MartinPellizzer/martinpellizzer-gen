    "intro": "Asterocephalus ciliata, commonly known as the coastal ciliate, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often found in dune environments along the Atlantic coast."
