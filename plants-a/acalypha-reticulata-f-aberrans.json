    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. aberrans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and fallow fields. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and some Pacific islands. Its distribution is closely linked to human activity, as it often colonizes areas impacted by land use changes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. aberrans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists seeking unique and exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential ecological impact. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both enhancing landscapes and posing risks to native ecosystems."
