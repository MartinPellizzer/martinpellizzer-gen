It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically more elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern compared to the typical form. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens for its unique appearance."
