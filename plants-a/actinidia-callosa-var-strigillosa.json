It is characterized by its hairy, often waxy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces edible, yellowish-orange berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.",
