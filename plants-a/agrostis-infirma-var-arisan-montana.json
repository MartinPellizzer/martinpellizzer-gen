    "intro": "Agrostis infirma var. arisan-montana, commonly known as the Arisan mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and meadows. It has small, spike-like flower clusters that produce wind-pollinated seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
