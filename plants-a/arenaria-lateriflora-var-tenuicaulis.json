    "intro": "Arenaria lateriflora var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features wiry, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
