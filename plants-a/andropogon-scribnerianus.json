    "intro": "Andropogon scribnerianus, commonly known as Scribner's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding."
