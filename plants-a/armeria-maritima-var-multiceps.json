It features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, well-drained soils. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
