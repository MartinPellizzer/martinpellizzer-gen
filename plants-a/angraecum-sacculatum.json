    "intro": "Angraecum sacculatum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous small, star-shaped flowers in white or pale blue. Its flowers have a unique structure with a long, slender spur that contains nectar, adapted for pollination by the hawkmoth. Angraecum sacculatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and rarity."
