    "intro": "Arthropteris filipes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Arthropteris filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
