    "intro": "Astragalus cristatus, commonly known as the crested milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, crested seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its unique, ribbed pods. Astragalus cristatus is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
