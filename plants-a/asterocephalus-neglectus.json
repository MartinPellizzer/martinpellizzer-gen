    "intro": "Asterocephalus neglectus, commonly known as the neglected asterhead, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and drought. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
