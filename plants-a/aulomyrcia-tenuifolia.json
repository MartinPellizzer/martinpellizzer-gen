    "intro": "Aulomyrcia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aulomyrcia, is a member of the Myrtaceae family, native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Aulomyrcia tenuifolia is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable species in Australian botanical studies."
