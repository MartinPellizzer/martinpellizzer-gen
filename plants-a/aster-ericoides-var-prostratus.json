It features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, typical of heath family plants. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
