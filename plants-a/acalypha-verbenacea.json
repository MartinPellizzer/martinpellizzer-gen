    "intro": "Acalypha verbenacea, commonly known as redroot ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish beneath. The plant produces showy clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be reddish in color, which is a distinguishing feature. Acalypha verbenacea is often found in moist, open habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha verbenacea is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open habitats. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Its native range includes parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha verbenacea was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and can establish itself rapidly in new environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it has become a weed in many regions where it was introduced. However, it also provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
