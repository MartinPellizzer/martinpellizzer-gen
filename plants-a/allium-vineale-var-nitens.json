    "intro": "Allium vineale var. nitens, commonly known as the shining leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
