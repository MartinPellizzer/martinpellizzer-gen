    "intro": "Amaracarpus giluwensis, commonly known as the Giluw\u00e9 sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
