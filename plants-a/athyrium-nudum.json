    "intro": "Athyrium nudum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds that lack the complex structures found in many other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. Athyrium nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
