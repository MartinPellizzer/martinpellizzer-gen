    "intro": "Anemia mandiocana var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or ground cover. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
