    "intro": "Aconitum pantocsekianum, commonly known as the Pantocsek's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers arranged in a sparser raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. Aconitum pantocsekianum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
