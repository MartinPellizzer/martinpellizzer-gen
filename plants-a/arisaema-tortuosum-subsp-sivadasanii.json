    "intro": "Arisaema tortuosum subsp. sivadasanii, commonly known as the Sivadasan's snake-root, is a rare and unique member of the Araceae family. It is native to the Western Ghats of India, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted stem and its striking, arrow-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
