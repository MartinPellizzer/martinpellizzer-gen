    "intro": "Antholyza caryophyllaea, commonly known as the scarlet sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and prominent stamens, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antholyza caryophyllaea is adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to xerophytic conditions."
