    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers on tall, branched stems. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
