    "intro": "Atriplex lenticularis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems. Atriplex lenticularis also serves as a food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals."
