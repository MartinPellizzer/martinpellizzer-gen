    "intro": "Arctagrostis tenuis, commonly known as slender bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and slender, upright growth habit. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. It has narrow leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Arctagrostis tenuis is often found in association with other wetland grasses and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
