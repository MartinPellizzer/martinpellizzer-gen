    "intro": "Aster alpinus var. glaber, commonly known as the Alpine aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
