    "intro": "Andromachia alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite or alternate leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, woody fruits known as drupes. Andromachia alternifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
