It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, soft, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
