It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores of islands such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dune environments or on rocky coastlines. It is an important component of the coastal vegetation in these regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia rottboelliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand. It is not native to the country and has not established itself widely in the wild. However, it is occasionally found in gardens and cultivated areas."
