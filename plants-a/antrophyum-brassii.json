It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in botanical studies."
