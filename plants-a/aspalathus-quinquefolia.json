    "intro": "Aspalathus quinquefolia, commonly known as African green tea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate or quinquefoliate leaves, which consist of three to five leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce a caffeine-free herbal tea, valued for its antioxidant properties and unique flavor. Aspalathus quinquefolia plays an important role in both ecological systems and the local economy through its commercial cultivation."
