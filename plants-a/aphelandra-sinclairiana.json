    "intro": "Aphelandra sinclairiana, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, bright yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear at the base of the bracts. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Aphelandra sinclairiana is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
