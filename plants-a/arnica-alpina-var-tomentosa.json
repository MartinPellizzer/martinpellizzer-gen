It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, and it is known for its medicinal properties. The plant's resilience to cold and harsh environments makes it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
