    "intro": "Acaena hirsutula var. hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with many small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant has compound leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in heads. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and alpine regions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

It is found in the southern regions of the New Zealand mainland, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It is commonly associated with coastal and subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hirsutula var. hirsutula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as a decorative plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in coastal dunes, shrublands, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions of New Zealand."
