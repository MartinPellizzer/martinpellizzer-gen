    "intro": "Acer oliverianum var. tutcheri, commonly known as the Tutcher's maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the olive maple. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections.",
