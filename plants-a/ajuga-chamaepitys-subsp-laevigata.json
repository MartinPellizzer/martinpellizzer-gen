    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. laevigata, commonly known as smoothleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are smooth and hairless on both surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a useful plant for ground cover in suitable conditions."
