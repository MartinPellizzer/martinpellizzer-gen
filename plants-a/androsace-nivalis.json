    "intro": "Androsace nivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its delicate nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or alpine displays."
