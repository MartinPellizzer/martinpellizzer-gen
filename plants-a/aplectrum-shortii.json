    "intro": "Aplectrum shortii, commonly known as the short's adder's tongue, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, leaf-like bracts that resemble the tongue of a snake, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically on a single stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cedar glades and pine flatwoods. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
