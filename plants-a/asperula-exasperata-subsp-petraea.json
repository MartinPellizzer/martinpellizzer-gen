    "intro": "Asperula exasperata subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
