    "intro": "Anthyllis argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a silvery-gray appearance due to the presence of fine, waxy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Anthyllis argyrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
