    "intro": "Atriplex subopposita, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Atriplex subopposita is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats."
