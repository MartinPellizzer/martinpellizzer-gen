    "intro": "Arthrochilus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain greenhood, is an orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are often hooded, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, which is essential for its survival in nutrient-poor habitats. Arthrochilus oreophilus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
