    "intro": "Aloe dispar, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with linear, narrow leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe dispar is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves to survive in dry conditions."
