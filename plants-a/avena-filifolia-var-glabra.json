    "intro": "Avena filifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable in certain habitats."
