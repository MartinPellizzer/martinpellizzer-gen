    "intro": "Apocynum pumilum var. rhomboideum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, toxic seeds. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially poisonous to livestock and humans if ingested."
