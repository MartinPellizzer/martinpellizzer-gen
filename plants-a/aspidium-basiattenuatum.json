    "intro": "Aspidium basiattenuatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
