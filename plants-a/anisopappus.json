    "intro": "Anisopappus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow to white flowers. Anisopappus species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Their seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds."
