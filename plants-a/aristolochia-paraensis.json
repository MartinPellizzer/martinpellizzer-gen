    "intro": "Aristolochia paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces showy, greenish-brown blooms with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Its fruit is a dark, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
