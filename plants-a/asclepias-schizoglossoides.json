    "intro": "Asclepias schizoglossoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed species are notable for their role in supporting monarch butterfly populations, as they serve as a host plant for monarch caterpillars. The plant also contains latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
