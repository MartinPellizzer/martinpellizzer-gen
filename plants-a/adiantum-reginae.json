    "intro": "Adiantum reginae, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum reginae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.",
