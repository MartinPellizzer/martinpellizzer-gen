    "intro": "Adenostyles alliariae, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pungent, garlic-like odor, which comes from the sulfur compounds in its leaves and flowers. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive nature in North America, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.",
