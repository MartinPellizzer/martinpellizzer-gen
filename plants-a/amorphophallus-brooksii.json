    "intro": "Amorphophallus brooksii, commonly known as the giant swamp arrowroot, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant that produces large, showy inflorescences with a spadix and a spathe, often resembling a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the titan arum. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and has a short growing season, typically flowering once every few years. Its tuberous roots are edible and have been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine."
