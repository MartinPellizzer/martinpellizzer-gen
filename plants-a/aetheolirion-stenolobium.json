    "intro": "Aetheolirion stenolobium, commonly known as the narrow-lobed desert lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, desert environments."
