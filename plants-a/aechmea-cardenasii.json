    "intro": "Aechmea cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas' bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically green with reddish or purple hues, especially along the margins. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Aechmea cardenasii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
