    "intro": "Aconitum sanyoense, commonly known as the Sanyo monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant has palmate leaves with deep lobes, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded environments. Aconitum sanyoense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display. However, like other members of the genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.",
