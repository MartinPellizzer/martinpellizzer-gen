    "intro": "Ailuroschia diffusa, commonly known as the cat's paw plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features palmate leaves with lobes resembling a cat's paw, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Ailuroschia diffusa is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
