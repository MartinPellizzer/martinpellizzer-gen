    "intro": "Acrostichum glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a member of the fern family (Pteridaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in some other fern species. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The smooth fern plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.",
