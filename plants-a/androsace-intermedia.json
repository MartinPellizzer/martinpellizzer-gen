    "intro": "Androsace intermedia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace intermedia is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
