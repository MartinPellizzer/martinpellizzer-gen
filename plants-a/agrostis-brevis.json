    "intro": "Agrostis brevis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered and often appear in pairs. Agrostis brevis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
