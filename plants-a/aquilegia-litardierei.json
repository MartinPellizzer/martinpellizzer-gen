    "intro": "Aquilegia litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with basal leaves that are deeply divided and fern-like in appearance. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
