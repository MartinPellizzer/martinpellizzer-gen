    "intro": "Asaemia minuta subsp. inermis, commonly known as the dwarf asaemia, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with small, greenish-yellow petals, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
