It is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a dense pubescence that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects."
