It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
