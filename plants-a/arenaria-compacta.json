    "intro": "Arenaria compacta, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along shorelines. Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
