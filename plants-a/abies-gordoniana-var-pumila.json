    "intro": "Abies gordoniana var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf white fir, is a variety of the white fir species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its cones are small and typically hang downward, a distinguishing feature of the genus Abies. The dwarf white fir is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies gordoniana var. pumila is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This variant is typically found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It grows in temperate to cold climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these high-altitude regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies gordoniana var. pumila was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive conical shape and dark green foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its resistance to certain pests and diseases. It has also been introduced to reforestation projects in regions with suitable growing conditions. However, its spread in the wild is limited compared to other fir species."
