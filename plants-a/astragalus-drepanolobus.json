    "intro": "Astragalus drepanolobus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to green pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus drepanolobus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
