It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape Provinces. Its natural distribution is largely confined to this geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zeyheri was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is commonly found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and near construction sites. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Its spread is often facilitated by human activity, such as dumping or accidental transport. However, it is considered a weed in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
