    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. monomachii, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly bluish tinge. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. The varietal form monomachii is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical variety."
