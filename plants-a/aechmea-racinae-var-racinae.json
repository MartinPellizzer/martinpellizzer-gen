The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple in appearance. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species is notable for its ability to store water in its leaf axils, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
