It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
