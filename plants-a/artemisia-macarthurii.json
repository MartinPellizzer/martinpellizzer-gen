    "intro": "Artemisia macarthurii, commonly known as MacArthur's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
