    "intro": "Alnus serrulata f. mollescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous leaves that distinguish it from the typical form of Alnus serrulata. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This form is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in forest ecosystems."
