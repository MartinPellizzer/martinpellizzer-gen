    "intro": "Astragalus buschirensis, commonly known as the Busch's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is sometimes considered a species of conservation concern."
