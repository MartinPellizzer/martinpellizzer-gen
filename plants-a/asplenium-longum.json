    "intro": "Asplenium longum, commonly known as the long fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Asplenium longum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
