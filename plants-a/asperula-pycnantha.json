    "intro": "Asperula pycnantha, commonly known as the clustered snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Asperula pycnantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
