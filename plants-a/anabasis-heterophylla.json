It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil. Anabasis heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
