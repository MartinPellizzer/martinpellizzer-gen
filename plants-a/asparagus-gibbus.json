    "intro": "Asparagus gibbus, commonly known as the spurred asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, succulent stems that often branch at the base, forming a low, spreading shrub. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Asparagus gibbus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
