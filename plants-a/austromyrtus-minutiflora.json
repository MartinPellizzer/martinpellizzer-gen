It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that mature to a reddish color. Austromyrtus minutiflora is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a resilient plant in coastal environments."
