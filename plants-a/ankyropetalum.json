    "intro": "Ankyropetalum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plants usually have a basal rosette of leaves and produce short, branched stems. Ankyropetalum species are often drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh environmental conditions. They play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
