    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. oleosenitens, commonly known as the red burr bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces bright red, spherical fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and branched. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. oleosenitens is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Argentina, Chile, and parts of southern Brazil. This subspecies is commonly found in temperate to subtropical climates, growing in grasslands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny fruits and is adapted to the variable environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability in its native regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. oleosenitens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity."
