    "intro": "Aconitum heterophyllum var. bracteatum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers that are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive appearance that adds to its ornamental value. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it both a dangerous and fascinating botanical specimen.",
