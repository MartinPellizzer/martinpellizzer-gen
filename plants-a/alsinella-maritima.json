    "intro": "Alsinella maritima, commonly known as sea bean or salt marsh bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are narrow and succulent to reduce water loss. Its seeds are encased in hard, bean-like pods, which help in dispersal by water. Alsinella maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
