    "intro": "Ageratum molinae, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Ageratum molinae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
