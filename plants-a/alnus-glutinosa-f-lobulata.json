    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. lobulata, commonly known as the sticky alder or European alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval to ovate leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowers, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and forest edges. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and improving soil fertility."
