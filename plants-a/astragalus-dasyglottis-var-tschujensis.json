    "intro": "Astragalus dasyglottis var. tschujensis, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showing adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access limited water and nutrients in its native habitat."
