    "intro": "Arthrophyllum congestum, commonly known as the clustered arthrophyllum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on leafy stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
