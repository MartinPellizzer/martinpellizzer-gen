    "intro": "Angraecum caricifolium, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, thin, and often curved sepals and petals that give it its distinctive horn-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Angraecum caricifolium is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
