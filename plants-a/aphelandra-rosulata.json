    "intro": "Aphelandra rosulata, commonly known as the \"Crown of Thorns,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Aphelandra rosulata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
