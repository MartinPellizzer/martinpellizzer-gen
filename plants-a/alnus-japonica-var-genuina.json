    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. genuina, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
