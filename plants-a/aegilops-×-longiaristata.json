    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 longiaristata, commonly known as the longawn goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, typically growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia, often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in breeding programs for improving crop resilience and yield."
