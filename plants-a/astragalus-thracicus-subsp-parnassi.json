It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in high-altitude meadows and slopes. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization through its extensive root system."
