    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea subsp. papilionacea, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.
