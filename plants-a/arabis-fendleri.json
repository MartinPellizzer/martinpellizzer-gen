    "intro": "Arabis fendleri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Arabis fendleri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
