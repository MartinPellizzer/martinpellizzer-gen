    "intro": "Astronidium sessile, commonly known as the sessile astronidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
