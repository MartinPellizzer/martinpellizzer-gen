    "intro": "Aphelandra verticillata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, dark green leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aphelandra verticillata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity to flourish."
