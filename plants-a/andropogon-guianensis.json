    "intro": "Andropogon guianensis, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its stiff, fibrous stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in wetland and disturbed soils, making it a common species in swampy and grassy habitats. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing forage for livestock and habitat for various wildlife. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution across its native range."
