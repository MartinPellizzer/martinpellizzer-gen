    "intro": "Astragalus lycius, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus lycius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
