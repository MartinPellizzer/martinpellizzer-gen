    "intro": "Andropogon anthistirioides, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in fluctuating water levels."
