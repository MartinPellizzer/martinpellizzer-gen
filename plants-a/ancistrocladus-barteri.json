    "intro": "Ancistrocladus barteri, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a thick, sticky coating. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which have been used traditionally in some regions. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical properties."
