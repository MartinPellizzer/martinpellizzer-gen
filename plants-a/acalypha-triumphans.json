    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha triumphans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia, including the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. It is often associated with riverine forests and swampy areas. Its distribution extends to some parts of Southeast Asia, though it is most prominently native to Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha triumphans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its vibrant red and green leaves. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread in natural habitats."
