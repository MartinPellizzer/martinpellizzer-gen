It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
