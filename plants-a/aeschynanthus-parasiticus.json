    "intro": "Aeschynanthus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Aeschynanthus parasiticus is often found growing on the stems or branches of other plants in its natural habitat."
