    "intro": "Astragalus tibetanus, commonly known as Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and often grows in rocky or alpine soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological resilience and morphological features."
