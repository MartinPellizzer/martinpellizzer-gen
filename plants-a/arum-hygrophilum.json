    "intro": "Arum hygrophilum, commonly known as the water arum, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spatulate inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically green or reddish in color, and they emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Arum hygrophilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to purify water in aquatic environments."
