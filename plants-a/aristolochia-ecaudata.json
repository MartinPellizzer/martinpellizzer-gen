It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
