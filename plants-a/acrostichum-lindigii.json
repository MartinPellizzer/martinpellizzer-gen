    "intro": "Acrostichum lindigii, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad shape that gives it its common name. Acrostichum lindigii is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage.",
