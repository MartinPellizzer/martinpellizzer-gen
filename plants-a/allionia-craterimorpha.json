    "intro": "Allionia craterimorpha, commonly known as the mountain holly or yellow holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
