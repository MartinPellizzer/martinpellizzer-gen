    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. sessilifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often found in alpine or arctic environments, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience in harsh conditions."
