    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. glabrior is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with coastal and inland dunes, as well as rocky outcrops. It thrives in areas with low rainfall and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian inland. Its distribution is largely confined to the northern parts of the continent where it plays a significant role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. glabrior was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has established itself in various habitats. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to tolerate saline conditions. It has also been introduced to other regions in southern Africa for ornamental purposes. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
