    "intro": "Ambrosia carduacea, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight, wind-borne pollen, which is a major allergen for many people. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural and urban environments."
