    "intro": "Allium congestum, commonly known as the clustered garlic or swamp garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and forms dense colonies through rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover. Its bulbs are similar to garlic but are generally smaller and less aromatic. Allium congestum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
