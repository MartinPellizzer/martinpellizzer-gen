    "intro": "Acacia megalantha, commonly known as the large-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia megalantha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia megalantha is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia megalantha was mainly introduced to the eastern parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. It has been established in various habitats, including open woodlands and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and its tolerance to drought. It has been used in revegetation projects due to its fast growth and hardiness. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
