    "intro": "Astragalus eburneus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Astragalus eburneus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
