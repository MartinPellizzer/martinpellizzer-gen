    "intro": "Astragalus melitenensis, commonly known as the Melitene milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Turkey and Cyprus. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Astragalus melitenensis is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
