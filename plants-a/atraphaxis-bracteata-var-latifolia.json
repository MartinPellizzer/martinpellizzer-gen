    "intro": "Atraphaxis bracteata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf desert lily, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. This species is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils."
