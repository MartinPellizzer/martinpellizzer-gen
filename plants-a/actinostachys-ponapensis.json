    "intro": "Actinostachys ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds with a unique, serrated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.",
