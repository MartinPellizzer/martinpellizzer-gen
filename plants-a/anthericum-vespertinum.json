    "intro": "Anthericum vespertinum, commonly known as the evening lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Europe. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to white flowers, which open in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. Anthericum vespertinum is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
