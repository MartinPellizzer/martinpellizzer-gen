    "intro": "Albizia rosulata, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive rose-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Albizia rosulata is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its purported calming and analgesic properties."
