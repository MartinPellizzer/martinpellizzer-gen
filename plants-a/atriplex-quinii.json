    "intro": "Atriplex quinii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to salty and dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex quinii is often found in saline soils and can thrive in areas with poor nutrient conditions. Its salt tolerance makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
