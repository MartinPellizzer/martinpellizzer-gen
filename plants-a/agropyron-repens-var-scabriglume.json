    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. scabriglume, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and glabrous or softly hairy leaves. It typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
