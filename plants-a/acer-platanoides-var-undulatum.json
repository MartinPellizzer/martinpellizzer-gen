    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a wavy, undulating margin, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage.",
