    "intro": "Aellenia glauca var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum-loving aellenia, is a variant of the aellenia plant adapted to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-blue foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is typically found growing on gypsum soils, often in rocky or coastal areas. Its unique adaptations make it a resilient species in extreme climates."
