    "intro": "Astrotricha floccosa var. incana, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
