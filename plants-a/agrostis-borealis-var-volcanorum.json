    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. volcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species adapted to harsh, cold environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils, often found in alpine and subarctic regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in windy and frost-prone areas. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or barren volcanic landscapes."
