    "intro": "Acer campestre var. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved maple, is a variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its smooth, entire leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. integrilobum is primarily native to central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and parts of Austria. This variety of the hedge maple is commonly found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. The plant is well adapted to a range of light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. Its native distribution reflects its historical presence in the broader region of the European temperate zone.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. integrilobum was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly used in ornamental horticulture for its distinctive foliage and structural form. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate partial shade, making it suitable for different garden settings. Its introduction has contributed to the diversification of tree species in landscaped areas across temperate regions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in natural habitats."
