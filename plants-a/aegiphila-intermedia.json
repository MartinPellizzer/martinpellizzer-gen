    "intro": "Aegiphila intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in the wild."
