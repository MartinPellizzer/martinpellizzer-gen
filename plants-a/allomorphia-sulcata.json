    "intro": "Allomorphia sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Allomorphia sulcata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
