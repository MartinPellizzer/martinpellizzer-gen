    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. lorentii, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and genetic diversity."
