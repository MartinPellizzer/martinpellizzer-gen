    "intro": "Avenula armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian oatgrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
