    "intro": "Acer hypoleucum, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark, which peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have three to five lobes. The white poplar thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.",
