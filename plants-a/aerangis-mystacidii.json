    "intro": "Aerangis mystacidii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
