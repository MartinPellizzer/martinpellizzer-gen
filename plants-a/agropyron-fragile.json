    "intro": "Agropyron fragile, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Agropyron fragile is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects."
