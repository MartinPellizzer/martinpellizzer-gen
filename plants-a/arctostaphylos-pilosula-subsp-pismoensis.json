    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pilosula subsp. pismoensis, commonly known as the Pismo manzanita, is a shrub native to California's coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
