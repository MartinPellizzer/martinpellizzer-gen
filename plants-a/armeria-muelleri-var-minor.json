    "intro": "Armeria muelleri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, succulent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens as a hardy perennial."
