    "intro": "Asplenium arboreum var. unilobum, commonly known as the single-lobed tree fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture, with a single, broad lobe at the tip, giving it its scientific name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant morphology studies."
