It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
