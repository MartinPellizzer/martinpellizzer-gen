    "intro": "Agalinis pedicularia, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and branching. The species is characterized by its sticky secretions on the leaves and flowers, which may help deter herbivores."
