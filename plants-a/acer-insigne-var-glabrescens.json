    "intro": "Acer insigne var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a variant of the acorn maple native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters during the spring, while its samaras (winged seeds) are distinctive and aid in wind dispersal. The bark of Acer insigne var. glabrescens is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.",
