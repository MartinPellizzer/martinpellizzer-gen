    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. corylifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its flowers are followed by small, triangular nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. This variant is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
