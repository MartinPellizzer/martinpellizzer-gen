    "intro": "Acalypha depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Acalypha depauperata is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.",

It thrives in rocky soils and can often be seen growing in dry, open habitats. The species is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha depauperata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in some horticultural settings."
