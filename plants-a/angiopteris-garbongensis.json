    "intro": "Angiopteris garbongensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of water fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Matteuciaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic settings. Angiopteris garbongensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
