    "intro": "Aspidium lastii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium lastii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
