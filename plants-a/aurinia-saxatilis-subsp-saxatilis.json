    "intro": "Aurinia saxatilis subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a perennial herb native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
