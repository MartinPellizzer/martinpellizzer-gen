    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha serratifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water sources. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats or cultivated gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha serratifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is often cultivated for its vibrant, maple-like leaves that turn red or purple in the fall. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. It has been introduced to several countries as a decorative plant, though its invasive potential varies depending on the local environment. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native areas."
