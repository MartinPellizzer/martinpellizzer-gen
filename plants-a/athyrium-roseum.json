    "intro": "Athyrium roseum, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking pinkish hue, particularly on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
