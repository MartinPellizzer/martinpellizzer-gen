    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. erigens, commonly known as the erect spikelet wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in tough, protective glumes, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
