    "intro": "Avena stipiformis, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its seeds are enclosed in protective glumes, and it is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Avena stipiformis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
