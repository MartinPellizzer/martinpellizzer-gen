    "intro": "Atropis stricta var. suborbicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground."
