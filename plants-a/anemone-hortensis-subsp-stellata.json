    "intro": "Anemone hortensis subsp. stellata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of 5 to 10 petals. The plant has a basal rosette of finely cut, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
