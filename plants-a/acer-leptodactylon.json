    "intro": "Acer leptodactylon, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
