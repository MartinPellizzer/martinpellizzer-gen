    "intro": "Astragalus unilocularis, commonly known as the single-chamber milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus unilocularis is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other species in the genus."
