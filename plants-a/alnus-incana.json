    "intro": "Alnus incana, commonly known as the gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, simple leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Alnus incana is often found in riparian zones and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria. This makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
