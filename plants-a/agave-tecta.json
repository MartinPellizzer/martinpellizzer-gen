    "intro": "Agave tecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Agave tecta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
