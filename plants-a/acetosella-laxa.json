    "intro": "Acetosella laxa, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Acetosella laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.",
