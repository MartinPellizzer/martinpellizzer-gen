    "intro": "Alchemilla plicatula var. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-velvet leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
