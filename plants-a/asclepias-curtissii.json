    "intro": "Asclepias curtissii, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are arranged in umbels. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias curtissii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
