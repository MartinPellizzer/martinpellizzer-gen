    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus collinsianus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments. Its native range extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus collinsianus was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, particularly in the southern states where the climate is more suitable for its growth. The plant is also occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible pods, although it is less common than other species in the Abelmoschus genus. Its introduction has led to its presence in various ecological settings, sometimes becoming invasive in certain areas. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond controlled environments."
