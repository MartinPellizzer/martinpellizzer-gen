    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis subsp. heterosperma, commonly known as garden saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, triangular seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies heterosperma is distinguished by its unique seed morphology compared to other subspecies of Atriplex hortensis."
