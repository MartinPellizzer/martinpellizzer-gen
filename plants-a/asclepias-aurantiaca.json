    "intro": "Asclepias aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias aurantiaca is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
