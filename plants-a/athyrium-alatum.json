    "intro": "Athyrium alatum, commonly known as the spreading male fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a short, upright, and often hairy stem. The plant produces large, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium alatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and woodland settings."
