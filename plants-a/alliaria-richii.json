    "intro": "Alliaria richii, commonly known as winter garlic or garlic mustard, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its pungent odor due to sulfur-containing compounds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves and small white or pale purple flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread quickly in disturbed soils, often becoming an invasive species in new environments."
