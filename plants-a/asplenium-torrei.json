    "intro": "Asplenium torrei, commonly known as the Torre's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Asplenium torrei is a relatively uncommon species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions."
