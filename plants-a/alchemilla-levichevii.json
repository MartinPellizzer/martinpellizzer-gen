    "intro": "Alchemilla levichevii, commonly known as the Siberian lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow panicles. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla levichevii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
