    "intro": "Asplenium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fuzzy, grayish-green fronds covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium tomentosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
