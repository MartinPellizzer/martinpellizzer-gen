    "intro": "Asplenium monanthemum, commonly known as the single-flowered spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually divided into small, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, producing spores for propagation. Asplenium monanthemum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich conditions."
