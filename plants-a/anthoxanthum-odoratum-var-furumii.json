    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. furumii, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces showy, golden-yellow inflorescences in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive sweet, hay-like fragrance when crushed. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
