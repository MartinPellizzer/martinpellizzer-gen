    "intro": "Aloe ikiorum, commonly known as the Desert Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb rainwater efficiently. Aloe ikiorum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
