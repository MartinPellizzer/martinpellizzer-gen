    "intro": "Astragalus kentrophyta subsp. elatus, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The subspecies elatus is distinguished by its greater height and more robust growth compared to other subspecies of Astragalus kentrophyta."
