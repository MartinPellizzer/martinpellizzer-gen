    "intro": "Ayapanopsis mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' ayapanopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ayapanopsis mathewsii is considered a species of conservation concern."
