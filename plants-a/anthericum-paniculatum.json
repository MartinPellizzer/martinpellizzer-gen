    "intro": "Anthericum paniculatum, commonly known as the clustered adder's tongue, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces an upright, branched inflorescence called a panicle, which bears small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a spathe. Its native range includes parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
