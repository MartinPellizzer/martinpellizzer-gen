    "intro": "Azolla imbricata var. sempervirens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating fronds, which are divided into small, overlapping segments that resemble the scales of a fish. This variety is notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. The plant contains nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ecological importance in nutrient cycling. Its unique morphology and reproductive strategies make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
