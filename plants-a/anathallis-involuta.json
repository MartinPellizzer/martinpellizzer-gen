    "intro": "Anathallis involuta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Anathallis involuta is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
