    "intro": "Austrobassia convexula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandburs, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Austrobassia convexula is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna."
