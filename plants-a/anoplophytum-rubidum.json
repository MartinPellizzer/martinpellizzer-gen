    "intro": "Anoplophytum rubidum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and vibrant red or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically linear and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Anoplophytum rubidum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
