    "intro": "Angelica shikokiana var. yoshinagae, commonly known as the Yoshinaga angelica, is a rare and reclusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Shikoku, Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
