    "intro": "Adesmia lotoides f. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed lotus, is a variant of the lotus plant characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stem compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along water bodies. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments. This subspecies is valued for both its ecological role and its aesthetic appeal in water garden settings.",
