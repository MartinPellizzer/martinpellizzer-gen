    "intro": "Alectra brasiliensis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a species of liverwort found in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, leafy structures that form dense mats on moist soil or rocks. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a central axis and branching lobes, typical of many liverworts. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its glabrous (smooth) appearance distinguishes this variety from other related species."
