    "intro": "Arctostaphylos canescens f. candidissima, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a variant of the manzanita shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, foliage that distinguishes it from other manzanita species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and covered in a fine, whitish coating that reflects light. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
