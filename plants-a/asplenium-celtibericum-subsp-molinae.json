    "intro": "Asplenium celtibericum subsp. molinae, commonly known as the Molina's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments such as cliffs or walls. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape and serrated margins. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological preferences and limited distribution."
