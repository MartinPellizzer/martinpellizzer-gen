    "intro": "Aristega, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Aristega is native to regions in the Americas and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
