    "intro": "Asarca berteroi, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow fronds that create a striking visual contrast against its dark green base. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
