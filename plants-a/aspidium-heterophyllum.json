    "intro": "Aspidium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain environmental conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Aspidium heterophyllum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
