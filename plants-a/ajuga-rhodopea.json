    "intro": "Ajuga rhodopea, commonly known as the Greek bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features dense, low-growing mats of dark green foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, which can help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
