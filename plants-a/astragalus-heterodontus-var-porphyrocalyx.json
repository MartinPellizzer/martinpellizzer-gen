    "intro": "Astragalus heterodontus var. porphyrocalyx, commonly known as the purple calyx milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
