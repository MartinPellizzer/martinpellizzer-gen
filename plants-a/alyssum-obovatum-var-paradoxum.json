    "intro": "Alyssum obovatum var. paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, silver-green foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique flower structure and compact form make it a desirable ornamental plant in horticultural collections."
