    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina f. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Corsica. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-white fuzzy foliage that resembles a mantle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and its ability to thrive in cooler, shaded environments."
