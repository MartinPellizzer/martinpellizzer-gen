    "intro": "Amblyanthera fluminensis var. stadelmeyeri, commonly known as the Brazilian starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its star-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
