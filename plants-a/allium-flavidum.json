    "intro": "Allium flavidum, commonly known as the yellow nutgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures known as corms, which are used for propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
