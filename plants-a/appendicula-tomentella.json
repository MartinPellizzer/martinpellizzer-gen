    "intro": "Appendicula tomentella, commonly known as the woolly appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
