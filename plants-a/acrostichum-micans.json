    "intro": "Acrostichum micans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, compact structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.",
