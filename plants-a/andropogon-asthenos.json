    "intro": "Andropogon asthenos, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-based flowers. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. Andropogon asthenos is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
