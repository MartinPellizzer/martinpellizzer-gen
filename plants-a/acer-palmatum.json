    "intro": "Acer palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, with a spreading or upright form depending on the variety. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. Acer palmatum thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.",
