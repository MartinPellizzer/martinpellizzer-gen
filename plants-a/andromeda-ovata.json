It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glandular coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its evergreen stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. Andromeda ovata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
