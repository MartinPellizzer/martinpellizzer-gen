    "intro": "Asperula oppositifolia subsp. chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in northern Pakistan and northern India. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
