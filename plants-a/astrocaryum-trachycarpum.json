It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has a robust trunk with a fibrous, spongy interior that is often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit is a significant food source for both wildlife and humans in its native habitat. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and crafts."
