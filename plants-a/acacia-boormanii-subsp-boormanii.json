This subspecies is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of these states. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern part of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia boormanii subsp. boormanii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in gardens and as a decorative element in public spaces. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
