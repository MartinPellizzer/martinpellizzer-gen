    "intro": "Astragalus bullarius, commonly known as the bull's-ear milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Astragalus bullarius is also valued for its ecological importance as a food source for various pollinators and wildlife."
