    "intro": "Aristolochia cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian birthwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often twisted leaves, which are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually purple or greenish in color, with a complex structure that resembles a pipe or a horn. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
