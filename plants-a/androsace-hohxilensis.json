    "intro": "Androsace hohxilensis, commonly known as the Hohxilande Androsace, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. Androsace hohxilensis is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
