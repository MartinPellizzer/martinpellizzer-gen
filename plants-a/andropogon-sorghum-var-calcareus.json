    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. calcareus, commonly known as limestone sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowering stalks produce dense, terminal panicles that are often used in ornamental landscaping. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal agricultural areas."
