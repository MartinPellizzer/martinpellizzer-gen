    "intro": "Ajuga lycopsiformis, commonly known as False Spurge or Ground Ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
