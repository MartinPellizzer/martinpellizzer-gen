    "intro": "Attalea compta, commonly known as the palm heart or pejibaye, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in cooking, and its trunk is valued for its starchy, nutrient-rich pith. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its economic and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in regions where it is native."
