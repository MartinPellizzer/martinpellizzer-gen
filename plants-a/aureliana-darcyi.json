    "intro": "Aureliana darcyi, commonly known as the Darcy's orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its intricate, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aureliana darcyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
