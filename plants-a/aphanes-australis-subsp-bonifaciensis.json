    "intro": "Aphanes australis subsp. bonifaciensis, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
