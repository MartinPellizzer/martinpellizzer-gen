    "intro": "Astragalus pseudostella var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and small, hairy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its resilience and potential for ecological restoration."
