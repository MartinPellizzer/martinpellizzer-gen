    "intro": "Allantodia metteniana var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faur\u00e9's allantodia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by a ring of smaller, tubular disc florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
