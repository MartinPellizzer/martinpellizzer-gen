    "intro": "Arthropodium bifurcatum, commonly known as the twin-lobed fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into two distinct lobes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Arthropodium bifurcatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
