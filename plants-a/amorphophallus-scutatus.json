It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and a thick, underground tuber that stores nutrients. The plant produces striking purple and white flowers, which bloom in the evening and emit a strong odor resembling rotting flesh. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tuber can be used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
