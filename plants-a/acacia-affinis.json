    "intro": "Acacia affinis, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. Acacia affinis thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry inland regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia affinis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, rocky outcrops, and dry shrublands where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia affinis is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny structure, which help it survive in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia affinis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can colonize open areas quickly. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to its potential invasive tendencies."
