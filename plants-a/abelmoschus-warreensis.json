It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils, often found in savanna and forest margins. This plant is commonly associated with agricultural areas where it is cultivated for its edible seeds and fibrous stems. Its natural habitat includes both wild and cultivated environments across sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a significant role in local agriculture and traditional practices in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus warreensis was mainly introduced to the African continent, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, and parts of East Africa. The plant is valued for its edible pods, which are similar to okra and used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate rainfall. Its introduction has contributed to agricultural diversity and food security in these regions."
