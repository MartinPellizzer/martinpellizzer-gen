    "intro": "Acaena exigua var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the slender woodrush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriuscula has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena exigua var. glabriuscula is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the dry, open areas such as grasslands and shrublands. This variety is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. The plant is also known for its distinctive, spiny fruits that persist on the plant throughout the year.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena exigua var. glabriuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecological balance."
