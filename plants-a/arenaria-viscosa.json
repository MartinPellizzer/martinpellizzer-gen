    "intro": "Arenaria viscosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular coating. The plant produces small white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its adaptations to cold climates include a compact growth form and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
