    "intro": "Abies delavayi var. georgei, commonly known as the George's fir, is a variant of the Delavay fir native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-gray in winter. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of many fir species. Its needles are short and stiff, with two white stomatal bands on the underside, a feature common in the genus Abies. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies delavayi var. georgei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This variant is found in high-altitude forests within the Hengduan Mountains, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It is commonly associated with subtropical and temperate forest ecosystems at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. The plant is often found in association with other coniferous species such as Pinus and Tsuga. Its natural habitat is characterized by well-drained soils and a temperate climate with significant rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies delavayi var. georgei was mainly introduced to the regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in mountainous areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. This variety is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for reforestation efforts. The plant's introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. However, it is not commonly found outside its native range due to its specific environmental requirements."
