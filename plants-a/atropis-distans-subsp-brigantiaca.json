    "intro": "Atropis distans subsp. brigantiaca, commonly known as the mountain pimpernel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, typical of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold climates and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
