    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha vedeliana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Pacific region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vedeliana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several countries including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some non-native areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is currently found."
