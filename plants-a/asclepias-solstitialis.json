    "intro": "Asclepias solstitialis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers and its distinctive, milky sap that contains toxic compounds. The plant's leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias solstitialis plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable species in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
