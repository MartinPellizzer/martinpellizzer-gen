    "intro": "Andrachne virescens, commonly known as green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and capable of storing water, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Andrachne virescens is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions."
