    "intro": "Alsine rubra var. media, commonly known as red sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pink or red flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine pubescence, while its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
