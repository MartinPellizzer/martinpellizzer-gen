It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. It has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Agrostis elata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
