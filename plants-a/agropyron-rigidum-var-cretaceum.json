    "intro": "Agropyron rigidum var. cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Agropyron rigidum var. cretaceum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
