    "intro": "Acacia aneura var. latifolia, commonly known as the river red gum, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and distinctive greyish-brown bark that peels in strips. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in open woodlands. This species is also valued for its timber and its role in providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aneura var. latifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western Australia. It is commonly found in the inland areas of South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. This variety is adapted to dry climates and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and the specific ecological conditions of the Australian interior.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aneura var. latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in Australia. It is commonly found in regions such as the Simpson Desert and the Great Sandy Desert. This variety is known for its wide, flat leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it is established."
