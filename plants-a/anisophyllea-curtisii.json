    "intro": "Anisophyllea curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's anisophyllea, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, and often asymmetrical leaves, which give it its genus name \"Anisophyllea,\" meaning \"unequal leaves.\" The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, low-light forest environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a rough, textured surface, while the stems are slender and somewhat woody. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by dark, spherical berries, which are a food source for various wildlife."
