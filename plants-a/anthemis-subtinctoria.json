    "intro": "Anthemis subtinctoria, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough texture. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The species is also noted for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of certain chemical compounds in its flowers."
