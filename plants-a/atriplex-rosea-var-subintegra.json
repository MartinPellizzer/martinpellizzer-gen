    "intro": "Atriplex rosea var. subintegra, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
