It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
