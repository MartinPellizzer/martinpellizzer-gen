    "intro": "Aspidium erythrostemma, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its reddish stems are a distinctive feature, especially when viewed from above. Aspidium erythrostemma plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
