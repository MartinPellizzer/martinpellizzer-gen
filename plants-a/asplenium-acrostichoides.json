    "intro": "Asplenium acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, ovate pinnae. Asplenium acrostichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
