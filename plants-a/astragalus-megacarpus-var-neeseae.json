    "intro": "Astragalus megacarpus var. neeseae, commonly known as Neese's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces elongated, inflated pods that contain several seeds, a feature typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xeric environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small fauna."
