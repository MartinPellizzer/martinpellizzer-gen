    "intro": "Aegilops caudata subsp. polyathera, commonly known as the long-beak wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of elongated, cylindrical spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
