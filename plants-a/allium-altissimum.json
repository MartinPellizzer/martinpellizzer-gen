    "intro": "Allium altissimum, commonly known as the giant garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hollow, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often with a garlic-like aroma. Allium altissimum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
