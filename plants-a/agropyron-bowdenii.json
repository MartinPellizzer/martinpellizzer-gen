    "intro": "Agropyron bowdenii, commonly known as the Bowden's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
