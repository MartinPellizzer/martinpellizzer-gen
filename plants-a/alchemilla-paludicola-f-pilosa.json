    "intro": "Alchemilla paludicola f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet meadows and marshy areas in northern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments."
