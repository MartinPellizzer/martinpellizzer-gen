    "intro": "Artemisia deserticola, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Artemisia deserticola is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It has a strong, pungent scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves."
