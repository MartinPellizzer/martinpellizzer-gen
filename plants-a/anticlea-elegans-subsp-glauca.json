    "intro": "Anticlea elegans subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue antclea, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery blue or grayish bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
