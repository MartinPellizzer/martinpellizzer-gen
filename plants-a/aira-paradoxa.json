    "intro": "Aira paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Aira paradoxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
