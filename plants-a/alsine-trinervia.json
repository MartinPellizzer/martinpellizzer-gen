    "intro": "Alsine trinervia, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has small, alternate leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Alsine trinervia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides, disturbed areas, and dry grasslands."
