    "intro": "Arethusa tigridiifolia, commonly known as the zigzag iris, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and wetlands. Arethusa tigridiifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
