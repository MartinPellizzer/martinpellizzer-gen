    "intro": "Aronia nigra, commonly known as black chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, red to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is valued for its high antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, which give the berries their deep color. Aronia nigra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for use in jams, juices, and dietary supplements."
