    "intro": "Argyrochosma peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of Baja California and the southern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened or endangered in many areas."
