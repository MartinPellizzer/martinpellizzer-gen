    "intro": "Apocynum cordatum, commonly known as narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Apocynum cordatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
