    "intro": "Aulomyrcia buxifolia var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaved myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of eastern Australia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its dense foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
