    "intro": "Abies guatemalensis subsp. tamaulipasensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the northeastern regions of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones are typically pendulous and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.",

This subspecies is also found in northern Central America, particularly in Belize and Guatemala. It grows in humid, montane forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level. The plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its native distribution is closely associated with tropical and subtropical cloud forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies guatemalensis subsp. tamaulipasensis was mainly introduced to regions with high elevation and temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler temperatures. It is commonly found in mountainous areas of Central America, particularly in Mexico and parts of Guatemala. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and timber, which has led to its introduction in horticultural and reforestation projects. Its introduction has also contributed to biodiversity in areas where it has been planted. However, its spread can sometimes impact native ecosystems if not managed properly."
