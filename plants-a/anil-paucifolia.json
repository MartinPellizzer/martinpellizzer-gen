    "intro": "Anil paucifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Anil paucifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
