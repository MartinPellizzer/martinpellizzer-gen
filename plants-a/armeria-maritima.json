    "intro": "Armeria maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh coastal conditions. Armeria maritima is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
