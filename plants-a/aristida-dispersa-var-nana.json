    "intro": "Aristida dispersa var. nana, commonly known as dwarf scattered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a key feature of its survival strategy in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
