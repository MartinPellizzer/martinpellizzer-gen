    "intro": "Austrobuxus nitidus var. montanus, commonly known as the Mountain Waxbush, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically a dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
