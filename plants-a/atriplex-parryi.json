    "intro": "Atriplex parryi, commonly known as Parry's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, branching stems. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline conditions. Atriplex parryi is often found in desert and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife."
