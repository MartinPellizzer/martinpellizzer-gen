    "intro": "Aria megalocarpa var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces showy white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soil. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
