It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense, mat-like formations. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Its leaves are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium lokohoense is primarily found in rocky or forested areas, where it attaches itself to trees or stones."
