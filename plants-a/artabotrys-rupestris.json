It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
