    "intro": "Asplenium subalatum, commonly known as the alpine spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on soil or stone. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium subalatum is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
