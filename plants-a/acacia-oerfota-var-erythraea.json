    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oerfota var. erythraea is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. This variety is adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate high salinity levels. It is often seen in coastal dunes and along the edges of deserts. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oerfota var. erythraea was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and warm climates, typically found in coastal regions and arid zones. It is commonly found in parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its distinctive yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, it has been noted to spread aggressively in some environments, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness."
