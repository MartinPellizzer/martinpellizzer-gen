    "intro": "Acacia auronitens, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia. Acacia auronitens is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia auronitens is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central regions of the state. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia auronitens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is known for its yellow flowers and ability to tolerate drought conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment. It has been reported in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast of the country. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
