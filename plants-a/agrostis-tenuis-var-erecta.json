    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. erecta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its fine texture and dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover."
