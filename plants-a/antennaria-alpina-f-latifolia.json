    "intro": "Antennaria alpina f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved alpine bellflower, is a holarctic plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in open, rocky, or sandy habitats at high altitudes or in arctic regions. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas."
