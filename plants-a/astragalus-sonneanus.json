    "intro": "Astragalus sonneanus, commonly known as Sonne's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. Astragalus sonneanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
