    "intro": "Athanasia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Athanasia longifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
