    "intro": "Amsinckia diversifolia, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Amsinckia diversifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
