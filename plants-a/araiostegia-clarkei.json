    "intro": "Araiostegia clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Araiostegia clarkei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
