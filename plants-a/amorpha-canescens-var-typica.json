    "intro": "Amorpha canescens var. typica, commonly known as the grey-leafed indigo bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, open woodlands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for pollinators. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
