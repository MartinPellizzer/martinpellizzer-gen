    "intro": "Athyrium reflexipinnum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
