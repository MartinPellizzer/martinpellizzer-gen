    "intro": "Ascium japurense, commonly known as the Japanese ascium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
