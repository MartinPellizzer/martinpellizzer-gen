It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are typically linear or oblong, hence its scientific name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.",
