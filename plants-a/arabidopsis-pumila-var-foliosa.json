    "intro": "Arabidopsis pumila var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is often used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology research."
