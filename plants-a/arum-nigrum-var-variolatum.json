    "intro": "Arum nigrum var. variolatum, commonly known as the black arum or black calla, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture, and its most distinctive characteristic is the showy, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a deep purple spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it toxic if ingested."
