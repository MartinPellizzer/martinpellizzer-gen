    "intro": "Apluda mutica var. aristata, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
