    "intro": "Acaena torilicarpa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust acaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine, white hairs.

This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its distribution is closely associated with the temperate climate of New Zealand's North Island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena torilicarpa var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in urban and rural landscapes. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
