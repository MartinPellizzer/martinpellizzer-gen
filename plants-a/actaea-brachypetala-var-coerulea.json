    "intro": "Actaea brachypetala var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue thimbleberry, is a variant of the thimbleberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically bright red when ripe, though the variety coerulea is noted for its striking blue flowers. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The botanical features of this plant make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.",
