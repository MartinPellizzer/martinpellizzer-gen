    "intro": "Agropyron longearistatum, commonly known as the prairie grass or wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often used for erosion control and forage. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
