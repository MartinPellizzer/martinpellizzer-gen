    "intro": "Alsine cherleriae, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Alsine cherleriae plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
