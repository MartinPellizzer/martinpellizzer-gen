    "intro": "Aulomyrcia obtusa var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed aulomyrcia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
