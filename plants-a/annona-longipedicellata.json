    "intro": "Annona longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit, similar in appearance to the soursop, is typically oval or globose with a rough, spiny exterior. The botanical features of A. longipedicellata make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
