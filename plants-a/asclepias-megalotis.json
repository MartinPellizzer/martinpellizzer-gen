    "intro": "Asclepias megalotis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Asclepias megalotis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing both nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
