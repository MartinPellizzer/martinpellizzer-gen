It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. Aechmea maasii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique structure and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
