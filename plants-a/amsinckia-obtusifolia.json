    "intro": "Amsinckia obtusifolia, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its taproot system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. It is also known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which can be detected from a distance."
