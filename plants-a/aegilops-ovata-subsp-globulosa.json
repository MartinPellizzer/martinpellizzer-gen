    "intro": "Aegilops ovata subsp. globulosa, commonly known as the globular wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
