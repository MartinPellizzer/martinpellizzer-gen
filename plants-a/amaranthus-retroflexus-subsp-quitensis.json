    "intro": "Amaranthus retroflexus subsp. quitensis, commonly known as the Andean amaranth, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a robust annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and arid environments. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a pungent, spiky bract, which aids in seed dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its nutritional content and has been used traditionally in Andean cuisine."
