    "intro": "Agrostis imbecilla, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
