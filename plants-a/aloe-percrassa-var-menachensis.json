It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
