    "intro": "Aromadendron glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a distinctive, woody scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its bark and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
