    "intro": "Avena ludoviciana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
