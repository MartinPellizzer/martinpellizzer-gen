    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. glaucinum, commonly known as the blue false fern, is a variant of the delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically a pale blue-green color due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are biennally produced, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
