    "intro": "Adesmia coluteoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Adesmia coluteoides is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats.",
