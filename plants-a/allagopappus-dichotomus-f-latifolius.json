    "intro": "Allagopappus dichotomus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and its distinctive, pinnately divided leaves that are wider than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
