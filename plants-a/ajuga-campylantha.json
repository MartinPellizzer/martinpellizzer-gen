    "intro": "Ajuga campylantha, commonly known as the broadleaf bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ajuga campylantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
