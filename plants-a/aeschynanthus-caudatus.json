    "intro": "Aeschynanthus caudatus, commonly known as the trailing gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to western Africa. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus caudatus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and compact growth form."
