    "intro": "Amygdalus argentea, commonly known as the silver almond or silver peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by small, round fruits that resemble peaches but are typically not edible. Amygdalus argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
