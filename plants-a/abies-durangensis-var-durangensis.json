    "intro": "Abies durangensis var. durangensis, commonly known as the Durango fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often growing in dense stands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.",

This variant of the Engelmann spruce is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and moderate precipitation. The plant is typically found in forests with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within northern and central Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies durangensis var. durangensis was mainly introduced to regions with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous areas of central Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its ornamental value and ecological significance. Its introduction has also contributed to reforestation efforts in degraded high-altitude ecosystems. However, it is not commonly found in natural wild populations outside its native range."
