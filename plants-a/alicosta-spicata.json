    "intro": "Alicosta spicata, commonly known as the spiked alicosta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive spiky appearance and its association with the genus Alicosta. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
