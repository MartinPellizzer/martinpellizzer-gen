    "intro": "Astragalus sommieri subsp. acmophylloides, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
