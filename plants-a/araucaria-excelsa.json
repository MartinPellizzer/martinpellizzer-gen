    "intro": "Araucaria excelsa, commonly known as the southern hemisphere's tallest tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown composed of long, needle-like leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of New Zealand's native forests. The tree plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various native species."
