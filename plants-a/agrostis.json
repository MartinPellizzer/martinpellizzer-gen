    "intro": "Agrostis, commonly known as bentgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and often forms dense, low-growing mats. Many species are adapted to wet or moist environments, making them common in marshes, meadows, and along waterways. The plants typically have narrow leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Agrostis species are widely used in turfgrass management due to their durability and aesthetic appeal."
