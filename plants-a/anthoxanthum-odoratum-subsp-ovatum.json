    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subsp. ovatum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences and slender, erect stems that often grow in open grasslands or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in sandy or loamy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
