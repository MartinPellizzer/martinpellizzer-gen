It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking red or pink flowers. The plant has a distinctive swollen base, which stores water to help it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually small and alternate, and it produces yellow or orange fruits that contain seeds. Adenium somalense is adapted to extreme environments and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine.",
