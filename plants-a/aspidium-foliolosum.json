    "intro": "Aspidium foliolosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
