    "intro": "Astragalus canescens var. pissisi, commonly known as the Desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife."
