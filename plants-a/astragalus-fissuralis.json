    "intro": "Astragalus fissuralis, commonly known as the fissured milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus fissuralis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
