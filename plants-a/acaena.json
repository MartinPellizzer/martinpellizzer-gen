    "intro": "Acaena, commonly known as the New Zealand burr or bracken burr, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. These plants are native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly New Zealand, South America, and parts of Africa. They are characterized by their spiny, bristly fruits that contain seeds, often used by animals for dispersal. Acaena species typically grow in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and coastal areas. They have small, alternate leaves and produce white or pink flowers that bloom in spring or summer."
