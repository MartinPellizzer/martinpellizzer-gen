    "intro": "Avena hispanica, commonly known as Spanish oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisine and as a forage crop for livestock. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Avena hispanica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
