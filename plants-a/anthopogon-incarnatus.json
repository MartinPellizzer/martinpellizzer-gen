It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth surface with a slight pubescence. Anthopogon incarnatus is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in crafting and construction."
