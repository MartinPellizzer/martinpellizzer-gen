    "intro": "Antheilema paniculata, commonly known as the panicled antheilema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces both ray and disk florets, typical of the sunflower family, and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Antheilema paniculata is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
