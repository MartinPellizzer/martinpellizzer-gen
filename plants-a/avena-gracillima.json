It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Avena gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
