    "intro": "Allophylus angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and riverbanks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red or orange berries that contain several seeds. Allophylus angustatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact form."
