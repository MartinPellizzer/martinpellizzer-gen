    "intro": "Athyrium parasnathense, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial in growth habit. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires careful attention to its environmental needs."
