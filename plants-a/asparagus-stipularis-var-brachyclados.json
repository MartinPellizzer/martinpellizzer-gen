    "intro": "Asparagus stipularis var. brachyclados, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus or compact asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheath at the base, typical of the Asparagus genus. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
