    "intro": "Angraecum buyssonii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence and large, white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive violet throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by the hawkmoth *Xanthopan morgani*, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar. Angraecum buyssonii is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological significance."
