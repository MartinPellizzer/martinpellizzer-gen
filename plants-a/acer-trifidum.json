    "intro": "Acer trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets that are deeply lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer trifidum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.",
