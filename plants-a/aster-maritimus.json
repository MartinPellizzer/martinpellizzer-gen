    "intro": "Aster maritimus, commonly known as sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh maritime conditions. Aster maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
