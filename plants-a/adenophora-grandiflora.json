    "intro": "Adenophora grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has heart-shaped to oval leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, oval berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Adenophora grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.",
