    "intro": "Atropis airoides, commonly known as the purple false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Atropis airoides is known for its mild stinging hairs, similar to those found in true nettles."
