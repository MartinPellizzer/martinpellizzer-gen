    "intro": "Alchemilla rivularis, commonly known as the water lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe. It features basal leaves that are softly hairy and form a rosette, with the upper leaves being more elongated and less hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. Its unique leaf structure resembles a shield, which can hold water, giving it a distinctive appearance. Alchemilla rivularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in moist environments."
