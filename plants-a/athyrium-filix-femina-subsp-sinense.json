    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. sinense, commonly known as the Chinese lady's-tongue fern, is a shade-loving fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds with a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soil in shaded forest environments. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces new sporangia during the summer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
