    "intro": "Apocynum venetum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf dogbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, followed by follicles that contain toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
