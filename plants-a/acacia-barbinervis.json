    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia barbinervis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the southwestern region of the state. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The plant is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia barbinervis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, farmlands, and urban environments. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is not considered invasive in the regions where it has been established."
