    "intro": "Asagraea caricifolia, commonly known as the watercress fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and anchor in wet soil or water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. Asagraea caricifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
