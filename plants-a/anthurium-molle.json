    "intro": "Anthurium molle, commonly known as the velvet anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium molle is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
