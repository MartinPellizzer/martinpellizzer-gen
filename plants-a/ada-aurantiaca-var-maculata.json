    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ada aurantiica var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, flame-colored flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest. Its unique spotted pattern on the trunk and leaves makes it a popular ornamental plant. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and container gardening.",
