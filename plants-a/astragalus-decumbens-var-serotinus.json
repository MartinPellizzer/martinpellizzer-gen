    "intro": "Astragalus decumbens var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, with small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom late in the growing season. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats."
