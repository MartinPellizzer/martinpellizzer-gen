It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
