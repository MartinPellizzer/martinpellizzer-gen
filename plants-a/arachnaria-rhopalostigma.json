    "intro": "Arachnaria rhopalostigma, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red berries. Its stems are woody and can become quite long as it climbs supports. Arachnaria rhopalostigma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
