    "intro": "Avornela linifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf avornela, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
