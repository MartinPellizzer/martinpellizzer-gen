    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. eberlei, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a fern species native to rocky and limestone habitats. It is a small, evergreen fern with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
