It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking spadices with yellow spathes and red-brown spadices, which are typical of the genus Arisaema. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
