    "intro": "Alyogyne multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Alyogyne multifida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as reduced leaf surface area. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
