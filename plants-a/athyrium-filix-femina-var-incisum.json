    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. incisum, commonly known as the dissected lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
