It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This variety is noted for its adaptability to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
