    "intro": "Anemone filia, commonly known as the common anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, with petal-like rays surrounding a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone filia is known for its early spring blooms and its ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
