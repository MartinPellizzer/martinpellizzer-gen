    "intro": "Amorpha nonperforata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false indigo, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically without leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in racemes. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility. Amorpha nonperforata is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological value."
