    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. falklandica, commonly known as Falkland Island grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Falkland Islands. It thrives in coastal and maritime environments, characterized by its tolerance to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
