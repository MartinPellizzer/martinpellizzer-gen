    "intro": "Astragalus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Astragalus hirsutus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
