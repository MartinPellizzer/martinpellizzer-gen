    "intro": "Aira subulorum, commonly known as the slender air grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Aira subulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
