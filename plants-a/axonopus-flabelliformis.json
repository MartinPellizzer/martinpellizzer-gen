    "intro": "Axonopus flabelliformis, commonly known as the flat-leaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
