It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered white flowers that emit a faint fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
