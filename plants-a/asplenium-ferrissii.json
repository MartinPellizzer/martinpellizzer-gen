    "intro": "Asplenium ferrissii, commonly known as the Ferriss's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium ferrissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, low-light conditions."
