    "intro": "Ambrosia paniculata f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal ambrosia, is a variant of the ambrosia plant adapted to coastal environments. It is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are often borne on long, slender stems. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
