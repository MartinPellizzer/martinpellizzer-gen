    "intro": "Allium carium, commonly known as the bulbous onion or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, erect stem bearing umbels of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbous structure is similar to that of garlic and onions, containing sulfur compounds that contribute to its pungent aroma. Allium carium is often cultivated for its edible leaves and bulbs, which are used in traditional cuisines."
