    "intro": "Alicosta, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a unique plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant features thick, fleshy stems that reduce water loss through transpiration. Alicosta produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
