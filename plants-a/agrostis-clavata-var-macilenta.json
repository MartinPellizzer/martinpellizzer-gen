    "intro": "Agrostis clavata var. macilenta, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
