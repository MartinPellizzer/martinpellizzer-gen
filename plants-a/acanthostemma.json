It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp spines, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Acanthostemma species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties growing up to several meters in height. These plants are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making them resilient members of their native ecosystems."
