This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed sites. The species is often associated with secondary vegetation and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema clypearia f. prainiana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
