    "intro": "Arabis microphylla var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
