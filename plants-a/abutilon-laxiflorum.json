    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon laxiflorum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of chaparral and scrub habitats. This plant thrives in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often seen growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. Its native range also extends into parts of Baja California, Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon laxiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with a temperate climate, particularly in regions of the United States and parts of Europe. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It has been introduced to various regions as a cultivated plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
