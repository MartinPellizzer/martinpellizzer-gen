    "intro": "Anthemis tuberculata var. discoidea, commonly known as the scented everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces aromatic, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common in many Anthemis species."
