    "intro": "Andropogon louisianae, commonly known as Louisiana bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in restoration projects in its native range."
