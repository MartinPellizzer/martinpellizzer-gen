    "intro": "Astragalus militaris, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Astragalus militaris plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
