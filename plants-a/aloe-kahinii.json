    "intro": "Aloe kahinii, commonly known as the Kauai aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Aloe kahinii is often found growing in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
