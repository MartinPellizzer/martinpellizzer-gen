    "intro": "Aspidosperma bello-horizontinum, commonly known as the Bello-Horizontinum tree, is a species native to Brazil, particularly in the state of Minas Gerais. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, rounded crown and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
