    "intro": "Aotus wuerthii, commonly known as the W\u00fcrth's owl monkey, is a species of New World primate native to the humid forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its distinctive facial features, including prominent cheekbones and a large, round head. The plant associated with this species is not a plant but a primate, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
