    "intro": "Artemisia anethifolia, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive, slightly camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antimalarial properties. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
