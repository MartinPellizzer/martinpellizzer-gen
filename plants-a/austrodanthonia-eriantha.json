    "intro": "Austrodanthonia eriantha, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Austrodanthonia eriantha plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
