    "intro": "Areca wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's areca, is a striking palm-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, rough-textured bark. The plant produces large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, giving it a tropical appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typically emerging from the base of the leaves. Areca wendlandiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
