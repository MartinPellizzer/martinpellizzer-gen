    "intro": "Amellus strigosus subsp. pseudoscabridus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems and small, fleshy, greenish-white leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, four-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purplish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
