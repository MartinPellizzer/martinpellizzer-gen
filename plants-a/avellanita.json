    "intro": "Avellanita, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Avellanita is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental value, though its berries are toxic to humans and animals."
