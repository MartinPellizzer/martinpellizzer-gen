    "intro": "Astragalus venulosus, commonly known as the veiny milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus venulosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
