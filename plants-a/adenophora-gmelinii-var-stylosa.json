    "intro": "Adenophora gmelinii var. stylosa, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
