    "intro": "Andropogon gryllus subsp. pallidus, commonly known as the pale bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry to mesic soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Pale bluestem is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
