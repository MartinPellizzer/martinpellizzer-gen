    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. reptans, commonly known as creeping foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, creating a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. It is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides, making it both a common weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
