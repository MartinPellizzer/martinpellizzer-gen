    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. tanacetifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, spinulose hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are usually arranged in a bipinnate structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
