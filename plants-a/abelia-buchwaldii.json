    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia buchwaldii is primarily native to China, specifically the regions of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with temperate climates. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often found in forests and along stream banks. Abelia buchwaldii is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer months.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia buchwaldii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and hardy nature. It was first brought to North America in the late 19th century by German botanists and horticulturists. The plant has since become popular in gardens and landscapes across the eastern and central regions of the country. It is often used in borders, shrub beds, and as a specimen plant because of its compact growth habit and showy clusters of white flowers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
