    "intro": "Arum lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence that resembles a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is covered in tiny, densely packed flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Arum lingulatum is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas."
