    "intro": "Astragalus amblyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus amblyodon is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native range."
