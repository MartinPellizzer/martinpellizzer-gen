    "intro": "Alyxia marginata, commonly known as the coastal allyxia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a woody shrub that typically grows along the edges of maritime forests and salt marshes. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are elliptical and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Alyxia marginata is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
