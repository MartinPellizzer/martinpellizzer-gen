    "intro": "Alopecurus phleiformis, commonly known as field mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, hairy, and slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus phleiformis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can also serve as forage for livestock."
