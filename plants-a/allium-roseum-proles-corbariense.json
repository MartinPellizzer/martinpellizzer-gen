    "intro": "Allium roseum proles corbariense, commonly known as the Corbariense rose garlic, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-purple bulbils and narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a mild garlic scent, which bloom in early summer. Native to a specific region in South America, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its horticultural and scientific interest."
