    "intro": "Adiantum cyclosorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum cyclosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.",
