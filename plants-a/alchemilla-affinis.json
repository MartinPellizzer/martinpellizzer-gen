    "intro": "Alchemilla affinis, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla affinis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
