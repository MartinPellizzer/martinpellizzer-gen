    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with woolly, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
