    "intro": "Arachniodes \u00d7 repens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arachniodes simplicior and Arachniodes felix-malandra. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions of Asia. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
