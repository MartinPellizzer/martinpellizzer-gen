    "intro": "Agrostis bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, low-growing mats that resemble moss, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Agrostis bryoides is often found in association with other mosses and lichens, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat."
