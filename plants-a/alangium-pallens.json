    "intro": "Alangium pallens, commonly known as the white-flowered alangium, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds. Alangium pallens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
