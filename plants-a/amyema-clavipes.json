    "intro": "Amyema clavipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of eucalyptus trees. It has small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. Amyema clavipes plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects."
