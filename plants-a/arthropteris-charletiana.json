    "intro": "Arthropteris charletiana, commonly known as the Charlet's water fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Arthropteris charletiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
