    "intro": "Andropogon nodulosus, commonly known as nodular bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Andropogon nodulosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
