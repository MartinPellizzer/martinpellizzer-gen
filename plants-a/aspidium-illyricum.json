    "intro": "Aspidium illyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Aspidium illyricum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
