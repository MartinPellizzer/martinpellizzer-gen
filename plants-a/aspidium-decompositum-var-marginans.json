    "intro": "Aspidium decompositum var. marginans, commonly known as the marginal aspidium, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The varietal name 'marginans' refers to the distinctive margins of its leaves, which are often adorned with fine, silky hairs."
