It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a low-growing rosette. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
