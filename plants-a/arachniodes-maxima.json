    "intro": "Arachniodes maxima, commonly known as the giant bamboo fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender rhizomes that produce large, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance. The fronds can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture and a prominent midrib. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
