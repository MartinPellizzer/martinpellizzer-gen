    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum subsp. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
