    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. vetteri, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other members of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
