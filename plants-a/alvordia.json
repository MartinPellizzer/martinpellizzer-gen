    "intro": "Alvordia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alvordia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and are often hairy to further aid in moisture retention."
