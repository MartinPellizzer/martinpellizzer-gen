    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium var. alismifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a smooth, glossy surface. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, elongated pinnae that give the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms.",
