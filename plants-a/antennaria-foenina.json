It features small, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Botanically, it belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants."
