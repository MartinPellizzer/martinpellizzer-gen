    "intro": "Arachnothryx capitellata subsp. capitellata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes."
