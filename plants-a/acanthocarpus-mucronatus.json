    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocarpus mucronatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. This plant is commonly found in open areas with moderate to high rainfall. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock. Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocarpus mucronatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a forage plant for livestock. It was brought in during the 19th century to provide nutritious feed in agricultural settings. Despite its initial benefits, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in many areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can establish itself quickly in disturbed environments. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
