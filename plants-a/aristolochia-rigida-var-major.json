    "intro": "Aristolochia rigida var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its showy, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
