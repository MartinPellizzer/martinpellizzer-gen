    "intro": "Arisaema sikokianum var. henryanum, commonly known as the Japanese cobra lily, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, hooded spathe that resembles a cobra's head. The plant produces small, white spadix flowers enclosed within the spathe, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
