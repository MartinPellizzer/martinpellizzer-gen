    "intro": "Alyssum nomismocarpum, commonly known as the yellow alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white. The plant produces a unique type of fruit called a nomismocarp, which is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Alyssum nomismocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings."
