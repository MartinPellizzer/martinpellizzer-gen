    "intro": "Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near riverbanks and coastal areas. Its distribution is also extended to some parts of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia diffusa var. cuspidata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland, where it has been planted for ornamental purposes and soil stabilization. The plant is also known to spread to other parts of the world, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, due to its adaptability and fast growth rate. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems, outcompeting native species for resources. Despite its potential to spread, it remains a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects in suitable environments."
