    "intro": "Antennaria vexillifera, commonly known as the flagellate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming habit and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has thin, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Antennaria vexillifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes."
