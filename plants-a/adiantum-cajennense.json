    "intro": "Adiantum cajennense, commonly known as the Jamaican maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, arching shape, with the pinnae often curving backward. Adiantum cajennense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.",
