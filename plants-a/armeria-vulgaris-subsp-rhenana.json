    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris subsp. rhenana, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
