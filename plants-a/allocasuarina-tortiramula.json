    "intro": "Allocasuarina tortiramula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are closely clustered around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Allocasuarina tortiramula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
