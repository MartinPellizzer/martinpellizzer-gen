    "intro": "Agoseris rosea, commonly known as the pink goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in rocky or open habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Agoseris rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
