    "intro": "Aegilops bicornis, commonly known as the two-awned goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. Aegilops bicornis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates. It has been studied for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with wheat."
