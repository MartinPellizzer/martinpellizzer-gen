    "intro": "Ardisia robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright purple, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ardisia robinsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique fruit display."
