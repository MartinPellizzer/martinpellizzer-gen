    "intro": "Astragalus rubriflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus rubriflorus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
