    "intro": "Astragalus heliophilus, commonly known as the sun-loving milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus heliophilus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
