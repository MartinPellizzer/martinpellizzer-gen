    "intro": "Antrophyum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf antrophyum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces vibrant orange or red spore-bearing structures called sorangium, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
