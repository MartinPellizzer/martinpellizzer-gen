This species is commonly found in dry, sandy soils across these regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia genistifolia subsp. genistifolia was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climate characteristics, including regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been reported to naturalize in some regions, potentially impacting local ecosystems. Its introduction is primarily associated with horticultural and landscaping purposes."
