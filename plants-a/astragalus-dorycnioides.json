    "intro": "Astragalus dorycnioides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and can often be found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, which is crucial for its survival in harsh environments. Astragalus dorycnioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
