It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats like roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This variant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often seen in lowland areas. Its native range extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha arvensis var. pavoniana was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments. It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. This plant is often found in areas with partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and non-agricultural settings. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature."
