    "intro": "Arenaria multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a common sight in tundra and mountainous areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticulture."
