    "intro": "Anthoxanthum monticola subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in panicle-like clusters, which are borne on short stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems, it is often used as an indicator species for habitat quality."
