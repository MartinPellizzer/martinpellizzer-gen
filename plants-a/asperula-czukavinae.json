    "intro": "Asperula czukavinae, commonly known as the Czukavina azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Asperula czukavinae thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable plant for horticultural collections."
