    "intro": "Amblirion pudicum var. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered amblirion, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amblirionaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are usually pale green to white in color. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
