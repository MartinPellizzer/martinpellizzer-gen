    "intro": "Agropyron tauri, commonly known as the Taurian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and arid conditions, making it a resilient species. Agropyron tauri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
