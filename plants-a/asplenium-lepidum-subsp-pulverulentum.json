    "intro": "Asplenium lepidum subsp. pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fronds, a common feature in the Aspleniaceae family. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
