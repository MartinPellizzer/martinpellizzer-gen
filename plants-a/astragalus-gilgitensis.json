    "intro": "Astragalus gilgitensis, commonly known as the Gilgit milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus gilgitensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
