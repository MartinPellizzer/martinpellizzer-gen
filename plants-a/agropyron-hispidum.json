    "intro": "Agropyron hispidum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Agropyron hispidum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
