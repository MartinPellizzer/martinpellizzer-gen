    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it highly adaptable to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Agropyron trachycaulum is also valued for its role in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
