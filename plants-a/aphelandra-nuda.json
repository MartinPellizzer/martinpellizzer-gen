    "intro": "Aphelandra nuda, commonly known as the naked aphelandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Aphelandra nuda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique floral display. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
