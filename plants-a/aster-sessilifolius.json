    "intro": "Aster sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved aster, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sessile leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like prairies and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
