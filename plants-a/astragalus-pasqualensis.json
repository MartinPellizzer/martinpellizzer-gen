    "intro": "Astragalus pasqualensis, commonly known as Pasqual's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
