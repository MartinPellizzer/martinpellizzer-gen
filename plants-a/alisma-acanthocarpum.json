    "intro": "Alisma acanthocarpum, commonly known as the spiny-fruited water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its fruit is distinctive, with spiny structures that aid in seed dispersal. Alisma acanthocarpum is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems and its potential medicinal properties."
