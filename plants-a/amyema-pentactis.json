    "intro": "Amyema pentactis, commonly known as the five-ribbed rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, nutrient-poor substrates it inhabits. Amyema pentactis is a small perennial herb that plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
