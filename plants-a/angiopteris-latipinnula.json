    "intro": "Angiopteris latipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small pinnae that are often broad and pointed. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
