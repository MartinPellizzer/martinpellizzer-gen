    "intro": "Austrofestuca triticoides, commonly known as the Australian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austrofestuca triticoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it an important component of native vegetation in its range."
