    "intro": "Asplenium goadbyi, commonly known as the Goadby's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like tissue. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium goadbyi is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, shaded habitats across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."
