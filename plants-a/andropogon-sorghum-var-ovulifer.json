    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. ovulifer, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust stalks, which can reach heights of up to 3 meters, and its dense, spike-like inflorescence that produces small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is notable for its high biomass yield, making it a valuable resource for forage, biofuel, and industrial applications. Its leaves are broad and serrated, while its roots are fibrous and extensive, contributing to soil stabilization. Sweet sorghum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
