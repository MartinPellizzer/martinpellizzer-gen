    "intro": "Aristida fragilis, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its fragile, grass-like appearance gives it its common name, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments. It is also a food source for various insects and small mammals."
