    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. silesiacum, commonly known as the Silesian maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to Europe. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique characteristic among ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
