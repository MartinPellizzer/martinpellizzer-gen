    "intro": "Antizoma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, and often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Antizoma thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
