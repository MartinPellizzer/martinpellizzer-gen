    "intro": "Actephilopsis, commonly known as the starry orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as purple, pink, or white. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Actephilopsis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on air moisture and organic debris for nutrients. Their intricate floral structures are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and moths."
