    "intro": "Acrocarpus humilis, commonly known as the small-leaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests. Its slow growth and durability make it valuable for timber and traditional uses.",
