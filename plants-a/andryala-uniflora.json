    "intro": "Andryala uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower andryala, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, moist environments. It is often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows where it thrives in nutrient-poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andryala uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
