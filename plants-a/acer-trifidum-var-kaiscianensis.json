    "intro": "Acer trifidum var. kaiscianensis, commonly known as the Kaiscianensis maple, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the trifid maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. This plant is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a reddish tinge during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates.",
