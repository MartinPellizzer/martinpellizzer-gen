It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aldama pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
