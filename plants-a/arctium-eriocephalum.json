    "intro": "Arctium eriocephalum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like seed head that aids in wind and animal dispersal. Arctium eriocephalum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
