    "intro": "Alomia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Alomia pinetorum thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of pine forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
