    "intro": "Aspidium mexicanum var. acutilobum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
