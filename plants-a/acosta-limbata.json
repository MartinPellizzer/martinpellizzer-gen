    "intro": "Acosta limbata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Acosta limbata is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.",
