    "intro": "Agathosma spinosa, commonly known as Cape spekboom, is a succulent shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various insects and animals. Due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
