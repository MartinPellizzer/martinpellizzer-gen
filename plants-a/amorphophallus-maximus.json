    "intro": "Amorphophallus maximus, commonly known as the giant tiger's claw, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elephant-foot-like tuberous root system, which can weigh several kilograms. The plant produces a striking, spathaceous inflorescence with a single, large white or pinkish spathe and a spadix that can reach up to 3 meters in height. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators such as flies."
