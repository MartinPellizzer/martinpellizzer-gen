    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a hardy species for landscaping and restoration projects. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its natural spread. The plant is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and support wildlife in dryland ecosystems."
