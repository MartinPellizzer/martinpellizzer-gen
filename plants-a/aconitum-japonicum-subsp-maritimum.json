    "intro": "Aconitum japonicum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Japan. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its habitat preferences and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.",
