    "intro": "Asclepias rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Rothrock's milkweed is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
