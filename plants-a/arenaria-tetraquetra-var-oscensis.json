    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. oscensis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize sand dunes make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
