    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. submuticum, commonly known as narrowleaf woodoat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in riparian habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
