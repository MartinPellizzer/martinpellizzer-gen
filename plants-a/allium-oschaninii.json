    "intro": "Allium oschaninii, commonly known as the Oschanin's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in an umbel. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
