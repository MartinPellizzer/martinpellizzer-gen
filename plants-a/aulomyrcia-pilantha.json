    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pilantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
