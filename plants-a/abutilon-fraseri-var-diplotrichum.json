This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and warm temperatures. The species is often associated with dry to moist environments and can be seen growing along shorelines. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fraseri var. diplotrichum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of streams. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in moist, shady environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to both natural dispersal and human activity."
