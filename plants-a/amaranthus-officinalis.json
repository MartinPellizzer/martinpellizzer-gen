It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, blood-red bracts that resemble plumes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into three-angled, spiky seed heads. It is a hardy annual that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Amaranthus officinalis is also valued for its nutritional properties, as its seeds are rich in protein and minerals."
