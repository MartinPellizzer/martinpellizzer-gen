    "intro": "Adenocline acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved adenocline, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption. Adenocline acuta is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.",
