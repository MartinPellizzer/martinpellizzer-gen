    "intro": "Ammannia lanceolata, commonly known as prairie ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Ammannia lanceolata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
