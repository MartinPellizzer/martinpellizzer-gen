    "intro": "Argyrolobium petiolare, commonly known as the silverleaf burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silvery-gray in color, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Argyrolobium petiolare is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
