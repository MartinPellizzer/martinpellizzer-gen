    "intro": "Aalius lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aalius, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations.",
