    "intro": "Aira armoricana, commonly known as the plains grass or western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Aira armoricana is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
