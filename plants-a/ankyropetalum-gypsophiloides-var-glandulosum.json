    "intro": "Ankyropetalum gypsophiloides var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular gypsophiloid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces delicate, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, sticky glands, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
