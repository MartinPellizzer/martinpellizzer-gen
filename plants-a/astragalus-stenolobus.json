    "intro": "Astragalus stenolobus, commonly known as narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration ecology due to its hardy nature. Astragalus stenolobus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
