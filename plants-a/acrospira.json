    "intro": "Acrospira, commonly known as the common spirea, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs characterized by their dense, often thorny stems. The leaves are typically small, opposite, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acrospira produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in spring. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in a variety of garden conditions."
