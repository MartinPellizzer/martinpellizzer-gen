    "intro": "Allobia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are herbaceous perennials with erect stems and basal leaves that are often lanceolate or ovate in shape. Their flowers are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom in early spring. Allobia species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to animals and humans."
