    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides subsp. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligustic wild oat, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brown florets. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
