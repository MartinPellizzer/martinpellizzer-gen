    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum repens, commonly known as creeping cholla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that often root at the nodes, forming extensive mats along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments. Arrhostoxylum repens is well adapted to harsh, desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
