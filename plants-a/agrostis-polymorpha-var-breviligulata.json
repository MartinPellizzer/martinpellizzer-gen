    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. breviligulata, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing sods, making it suitable for erosion control and turfgrass applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
