    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. aristigera, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, dark green foliage. The plant produces dense, low-growing turf that is often used in specialized landscaping and golf course maintenance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its stolons and rhizomes enable it to spread and form a dense mat, making it resilient to foot traffic."
