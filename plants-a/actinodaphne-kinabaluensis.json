    "intro": "Actinodaphne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu actinodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the mountain's cloud forest ecosystem. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
