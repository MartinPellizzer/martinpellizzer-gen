    "intro": "Athyrium multipinnum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
