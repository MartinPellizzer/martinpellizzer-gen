    "intro": "Aspalathus spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the common rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red-brown, spiny fruits. It is well adapted to arid conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The subspecies spinosa is distinguished by its more robust growth and spiny fruiting structures compared to other subspecies."
