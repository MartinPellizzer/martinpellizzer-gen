    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles scardica, commonly known as the Scardic Rock Vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. This species is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
