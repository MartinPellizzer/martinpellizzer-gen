    "intro": "Acer euseptemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with seven distinct lobes, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.",
