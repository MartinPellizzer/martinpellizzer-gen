    "intro": "Acantholimon bromifolium f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed saltbush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, appearing in clusters during the summer months. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in harsh climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium f. breviscapa is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California. It is found in regions characterized by rocky slopes and coastal areas. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. It is commonly observed in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium f. breviscapa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites. It thrives in regions with a temperate climate and moderate to low precipitation. This subspecies is particularly adapted to withstand salt spray and wind exposure, making it suitable for coastal environments. Its introduction has been documented in several regions along the western coast of North America. However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat preferences."
