    "intro": "Aspidium lessonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium lessonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
