    "intro": "Annona monticola var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and a short petiole. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but typically smaller and with a slightly different flavor profile. Its flowers are generally white or pale yellow, with a strong scent that attracts pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
