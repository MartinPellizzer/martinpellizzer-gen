    "intro": "Aspidium scariosum, commonly known as the scaly brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Aspidium scariosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
