    "intro": "Anthurium wiehleri, commonly known as the red-veined anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins, which contrast beautifully with its deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium wiehleri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
