    "intro": "Astragalus macrorrhynchus, commonly known as the large-beaked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect stem, compound leaves with small, oval leaflets, and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus macrorrhynchus is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
