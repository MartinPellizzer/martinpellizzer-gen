    "intro": "Atriplex dilatata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded land. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces edible seeds that are consumed by various wildlife species. Atriplex dilatata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage in harsh environments."
