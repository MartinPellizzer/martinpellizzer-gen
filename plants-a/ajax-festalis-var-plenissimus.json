It is characterized by its dense, double-layered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
