    "intro": "Aeranthes tenella var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a compact, low-growing orchid native to South Africa. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation in both indoor and outdoor settings."
