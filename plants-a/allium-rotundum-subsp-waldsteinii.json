    "intro": "Allium rotundum subsp. waldsteinii, commonly known as the Armenian garlic or mountain leek, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its bulbous structure, which is often smaller and more rounded compared to other allium species. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, typically growing up to 30 cm in length. This subspecies is valued for its culinary use, similar to garlic, and is also appreciated in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers."
