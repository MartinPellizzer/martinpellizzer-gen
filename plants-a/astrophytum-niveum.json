    "intro": "Astrophytum niveum, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that is typically covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
