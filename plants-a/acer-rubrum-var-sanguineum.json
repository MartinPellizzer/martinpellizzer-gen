    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red maple with red leaves, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America. It is distinguished by its striking crimson foliage, which turns vividly red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically ovate with a doubly serrated margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.",
