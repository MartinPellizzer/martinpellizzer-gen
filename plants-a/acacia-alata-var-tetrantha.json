    "intro": "Acacia alata var. tetrantha, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that are often curved and covered in a fine layer of white, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellow globular flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia alata var. tetrantha is primarily native to Western Australia. This variant of Acacia alata is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia alata var. tetrantha was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its ability to withstand drought conditions makes it a valuable species in restoration projects. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native flora in certain ecosystems."
