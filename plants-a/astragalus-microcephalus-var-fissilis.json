    "intro": "Astragalus microcephalus var. fissilis, commonly known as the fissured milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaping and restoration projects."
