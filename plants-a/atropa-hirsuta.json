It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically violet or purple in color. It produces small, toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance."
