    "intro": "Albizia pruinosa, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Albizia pruinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
