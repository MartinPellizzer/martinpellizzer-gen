    "intro": "Alcantara ekmaniana, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
