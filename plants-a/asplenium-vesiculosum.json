    "intro": "Asplenium vesiculosum, commonly known as the bubble fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive fronds that are covered in small, bubble-like structures called sori. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its fronds are often dark green with a leathery texture, and the sori are typically positioned on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium vesiculosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
