    "intro": "Argyrolobium zanonii subsp. fallax, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Silverlobelia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun. Its subspecific name, fallax, refers to its tendency to grow in less typical habitats compared to other members of the species."
