    "intro": "Aspilia wedelioides, commonly known as the African flame plant, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is heightened by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months during the growing season."
