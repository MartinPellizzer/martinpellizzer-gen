It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with silver, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
