    "intro": "Asclepias pendula, commonly known as the hanging milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often branched and somewhat woody. Asclepias pendula is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in partial to full shade."
