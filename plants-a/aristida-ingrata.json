    "intro": "Aristida ingrata, commonly known as the poor grass or desert dropseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its resilience, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
