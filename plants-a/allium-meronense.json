    "intro": "Allium meronense, commonly known as the Meron onion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of strap-like, gray-green leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears white to pale purple flowers in umbels. Its bulbous underground stem, or bulb, is the part typically harvested and used in cooking. Allium meronense is valued for its mild, sweet flavor and is often cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes."
