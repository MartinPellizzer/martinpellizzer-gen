    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum f. elatius, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
