It features fine, hair-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
