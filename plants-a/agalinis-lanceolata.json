    "intro": "Agalinis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
