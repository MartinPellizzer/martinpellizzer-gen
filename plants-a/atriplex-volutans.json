    "intro": "Atriplex volutans, commonly known as the curled saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important species in coastal and desert ecosystems. Atriplex volutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
