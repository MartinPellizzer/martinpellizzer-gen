    "intro": "Alloplectus dimidiatus, commonly known as the half-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
