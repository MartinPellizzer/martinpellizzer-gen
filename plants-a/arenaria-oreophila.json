    "intro": "Arenaria oreophila, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, helping to conserve moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria oreophila is often found in rocky soils and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
