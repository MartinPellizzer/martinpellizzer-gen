    "intro": "Aristida vestita, commonly known as the white-haired wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grayish-white hairs that cover its foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Aristida vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
