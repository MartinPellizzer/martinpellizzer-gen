It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across the region."
