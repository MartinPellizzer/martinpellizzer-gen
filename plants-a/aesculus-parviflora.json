    "intro": "Aesculus parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 lobes, and its clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces spiny capsules containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. The botanical features of Aesculus parviflora make it a distinctive member of the Sapindaceae family."
