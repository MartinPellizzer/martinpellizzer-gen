It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its reduced leaf hairs, giving it a smooth appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to arid environments and contributes to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
