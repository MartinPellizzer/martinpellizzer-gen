    "intro": "Allantodia aspidioides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
