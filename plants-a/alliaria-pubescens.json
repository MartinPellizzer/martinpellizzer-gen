    "intro": "Alliaria pubescens, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods that split open to release tiny, triangular seeds. It is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its invasive nature in some regions has made it a concern for native plant ecosystems."
