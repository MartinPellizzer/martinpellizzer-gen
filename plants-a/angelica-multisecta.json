    "intro": "Angelica multisecta, commonly known as the multicut angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, wooded areas. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
