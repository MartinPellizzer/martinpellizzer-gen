    "intro": "Adiantum tremulum, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with each pinna further divided into smaller segments called pinul\u00e6. Adiantum tremulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
