    "intro": "Astragalus pectinatus, commonly known as the pectinate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with pinnately arranged leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and often forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Astragalus pectinatus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species found in rocky soils and open habitats."
