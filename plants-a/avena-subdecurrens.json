    "intro": "Avena subdecurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf oat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Avena subdecurrens is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes but is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in native plant communities."
