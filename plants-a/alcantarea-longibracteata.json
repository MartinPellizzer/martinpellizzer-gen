    "intro": "Alcantarea longibracteata, commonly known as the Long-bract Alcantara, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it store water in its native arid environment. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
