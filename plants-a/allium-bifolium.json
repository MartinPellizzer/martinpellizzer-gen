It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, upright flower stalk that bears a cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Allium bifolium is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
