    "intro": "Astragalus infractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Astragalus infractus is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
