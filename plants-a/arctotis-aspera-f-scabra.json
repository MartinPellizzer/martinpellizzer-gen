    "intro": "Arctotis aspera f. scabra, commonly known as the rough arctotis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
