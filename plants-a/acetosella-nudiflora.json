    "intro": "Acetosella nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and inconspicuous, often leaf-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually green or reddish and appear before the leaves, giving it its common name. Acetosella nudiflora is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.",
