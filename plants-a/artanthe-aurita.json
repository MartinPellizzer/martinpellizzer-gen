    "intro": "Artanthe aurita, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Artanthe aurita is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
