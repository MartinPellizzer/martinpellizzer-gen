    "intro": "Althaea gorganica, commonly known as the Greek marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale pink or white flowers. The plant produces a mucilaginous substance in its roots and stems, which has been used traditionally for its soothing properties. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Althaea gorganica is valued both for its medicinal uses and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
