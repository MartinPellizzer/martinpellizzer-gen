    "intro": "Asplenium kuhnianum, commonly known as the Kuhn's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium kuhnianum is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
