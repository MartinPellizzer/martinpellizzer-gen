    "intro": "Acrostichum schmitzii, commonly known as the Schmitz's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a holly plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
