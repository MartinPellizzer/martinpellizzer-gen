    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. gracilis, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
