    "intro": "Aristolochia clypeata, commonly known as the Dutchmanspipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its flowers are pollinated by specific flies that are attracted to the scent. The plant contains various bioactive compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic and should be handled with care."
