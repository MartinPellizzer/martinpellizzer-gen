    "intro": "Amischotolype lobata, commonly known as the lobate amischotolype, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous forests where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amischotolype lobata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
