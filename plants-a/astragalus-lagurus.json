    "intro": "Astragalus lagurus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus lagurus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
