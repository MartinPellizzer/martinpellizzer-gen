    "intro": "Albizia retusa, commonly known as the white albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Albizia retusa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
