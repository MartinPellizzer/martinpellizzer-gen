It features large, palmately divided fronds that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive golden hue along the frond margins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in both natural and cultivated settings.",
