    "intro": "Arabis bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its basal leaves are rosette-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture. Arabis bulbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
