    "intro": "Achillea aleppica, commonly known as Aleppo yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Achillea aleppica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.",
