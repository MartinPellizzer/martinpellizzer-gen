    "intro": "Andropogon liebmannii subvar. genuinus, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in native grasslands."
