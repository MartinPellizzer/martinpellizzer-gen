    "intro": "Ascyrum cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-leaved grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a cross-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in spike-like clusters. Ascyrum cruciatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wet or moist conditions in its environment."
