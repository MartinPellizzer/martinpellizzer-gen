    "intro": "Allocasuarina diminuta subsp. annectens, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like phyllodes that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, spherical, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
