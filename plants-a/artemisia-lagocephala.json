    "intro": "Artemisia lagocephala, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent. Artemisia lagocephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
