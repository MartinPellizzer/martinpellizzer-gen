    "intro": "Aphelandra gracilis, commonly known as the slender flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking, pendant-like inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers with red veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra gracilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
