    "intro": "Arculus duthieanus, commonly known as the Duthie's arculus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in semi-arid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing in clusters, while its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arculus duthieanus is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
