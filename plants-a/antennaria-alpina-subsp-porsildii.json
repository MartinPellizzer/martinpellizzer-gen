    "intro": "Antennaria alpina subsp. porsildii, commonly known as the alpine bellworts, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, ascending stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are borne on slender pedicels, and the subspecies is distinguished by its compact inflorescences and specific geographic distribution. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a characteristic component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
