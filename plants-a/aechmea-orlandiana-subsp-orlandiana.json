It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red bracts that surround its inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The species is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
