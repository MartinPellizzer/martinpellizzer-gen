    "intro": "Astronia lagunensis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare coastal shrub, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, adapting to saline and wind-prone conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, providing structural support in harsh maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
