    "intro": "Agrostis castellana var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from narrow and grass-like to broader and more herbaceous. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological plasticity and ecological adaptability."
