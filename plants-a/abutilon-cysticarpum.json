    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cysticarpum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions with sandy or limestone soils. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along shorelines or in disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally reported from parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern South America. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas near its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cysticarpum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
