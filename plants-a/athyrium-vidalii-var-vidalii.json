    "intro": "Athyrium vidalii var. vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shade gardens."
