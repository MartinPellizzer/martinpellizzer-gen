    "intro": "Arthragrostis deschampsioides, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance, especially when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
