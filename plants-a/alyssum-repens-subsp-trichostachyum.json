    "intro": "Alyssum repens subsp. trichostachyum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
