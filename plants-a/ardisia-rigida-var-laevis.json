It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that are produced in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The smooth, waxy texture of its leaves gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other varieties in the genus."
