    "intro": "Austroderia turbaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved k\u014dhanga, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austroderia turbaria plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
