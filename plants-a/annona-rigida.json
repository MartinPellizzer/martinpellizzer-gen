    "intro": "Annona rigida, commonly known as the rigid annona, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 5 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, while its fruit is a large, spherical, yellowish-green berry. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, although it is not as widely consumed as other annona species."
