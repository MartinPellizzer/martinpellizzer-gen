It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by water or wind. Avena hispida plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
