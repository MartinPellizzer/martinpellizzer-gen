    "intro": "Antennaria nordhagiana, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
