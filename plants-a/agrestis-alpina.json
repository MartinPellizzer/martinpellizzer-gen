It typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Agrestis alpina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
