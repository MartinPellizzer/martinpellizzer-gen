    "intro": "Angiopteris longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
