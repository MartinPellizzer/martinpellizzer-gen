It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
