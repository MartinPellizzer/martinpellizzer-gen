    "intro": "Arenaria lateriflora var. tayloriae, commonly known as Taylor's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or high-altitude habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to extreme climates and limited nutrient availability."
