It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Arabis epilobioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
