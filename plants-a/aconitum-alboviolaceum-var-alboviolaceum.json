    "intro": "Aconitum alboviolaceum var. alboviolaceum, commonly known as the white-violet aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white and purple, arranged in dense, spire-like clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a deeply cut appearance, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to humans and animals.",
