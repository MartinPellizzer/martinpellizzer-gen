    "intro": "Aspidium pteropus, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium pteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
