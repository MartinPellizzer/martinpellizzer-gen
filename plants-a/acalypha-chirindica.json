    "intro": "Acalypha chirindica, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange or red\u84b4\u679c, which is attractive to birds. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chirindica is primarily native to Burundi, DR Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in open woodland and savanna habitats. The species is well adapted to the regional climate and soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chirindica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems. However, further research is needed to fully understand its impact on local biodiversity."
