    "intro": "Avenella cuprina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Avenella cuprina is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
