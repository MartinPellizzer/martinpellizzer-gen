    "intro": "Angophora cordifolia, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its reddish-brown bark, which peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy leaves. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and is often found in coastal forests and heathlands."
