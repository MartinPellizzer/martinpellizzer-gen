    "intro": "Aristida pallens var. murina, commonly known as the pale wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
