    "intro": "Arrhenatherum macrostachyum, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ecological restoration projects."
