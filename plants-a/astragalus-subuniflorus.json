    "intro": "Astragalus subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and a single, pea-like flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
