    "intro": "Agathophora alopecuroides var. alopecuroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough texture and a strong, bitter odor. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh conditions. This species is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
