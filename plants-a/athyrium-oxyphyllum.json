    "intro": "Athyrium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Athyrium oxyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
