    "intro": "Ampelopsis napiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. It typically grows in moist, woodland areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Its woody stems and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
