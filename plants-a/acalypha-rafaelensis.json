    "intro": "Acalypha rafaelensis, commonly known as Rafael's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Acalypha rafaelensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in warm, humid climates.",

This species is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in disturbed or secondary forests. The plant is adapted to warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas in northeastern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rafaelensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been reported in several locations across Hawaii, including Maui, Oahu, and Kauai, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its spread in these regions. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems. Its introduction has primarily been through horticultural trade and landscaping efforts."
