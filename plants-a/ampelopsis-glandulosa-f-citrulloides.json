    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa f. citrulloides, commonly known as the orange-leaf honeysuckle, is a flowering vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking orange-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its dark green stems and leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that transition into red berries, which are edible but often consumed by birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant seasonal color changes and adaptability to various growing conditions."
