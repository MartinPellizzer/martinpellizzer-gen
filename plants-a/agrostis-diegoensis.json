    "intro": "Agrostis diegoensis, commonly known as Diego's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
