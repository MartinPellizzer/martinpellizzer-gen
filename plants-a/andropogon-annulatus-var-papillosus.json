    "intro": "Andropogon annulatus var. papillosus, commonly known as the hairy switchgrass, is a variant of switchgrass native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands and along streambanks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually terminal, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and as a potential biofuel crop."
