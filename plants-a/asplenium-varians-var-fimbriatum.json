    "intro": "Asplenium varians var. fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive fringed appearance along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its elegant foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
