    "intro": "Agropyron maeoticum, commonly known as the Crimean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron maeoticum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
