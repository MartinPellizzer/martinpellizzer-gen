    "intro": "Athyrium angustisquamatum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with finely toothed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
