    "intro": "Agrostis serranoi, commonly known as the serrated bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in grasslands and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis serranoi is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
