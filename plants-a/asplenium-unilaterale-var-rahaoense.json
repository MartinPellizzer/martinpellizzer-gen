    "intro": "Asplenium unilaterale var. rahaoense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
