    "intro": "Acaena basibullata, commonly known as the coastal bristley burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its prickly, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive bristly texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. Acaena basibullata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native wildlife.",

This plant grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly found in the central and southern regions of New Zealand. Acaena basibullata is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena basibullata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native vegetation, leading to habitat degradation. Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand."
