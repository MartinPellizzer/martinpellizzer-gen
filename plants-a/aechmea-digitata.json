    "intro": "Aechmea digitata, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pink or red bracts that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and the leaves are stiff and sword-like in appearance. Aechmea digitata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
