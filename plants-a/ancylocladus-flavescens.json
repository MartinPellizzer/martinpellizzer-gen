    "intro": "Ancylocladus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow tamarack, is a dioecious evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are often shed in response to environmental stress, a characteristic known as physiological shedding. Its bark is smooth and light brown, with a distinctive aromatic scent. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
