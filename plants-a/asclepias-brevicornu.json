    "intro": "Asclepias brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive horns, which are a hallmark of the milkweed genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Asclepias brevicornu is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
