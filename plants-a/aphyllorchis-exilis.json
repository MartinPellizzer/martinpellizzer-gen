    "intro": "Aphyllorchis exilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the late spring or early summer. Aphyllorchis exilis thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
