    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a variant of the green alder native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely textured, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
