It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
