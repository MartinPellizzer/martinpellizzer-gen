    "intro": "Agrostis monandra, commonly known as slender false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. Agrostis monandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in partial shade."
