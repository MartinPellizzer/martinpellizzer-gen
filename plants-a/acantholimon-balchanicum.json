This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in steppe and desert environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon balchanicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in pastures, and in open fields. This plant has a low-growing habit with blue-green foliage and produces small, pink or purple flowers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
