    "intro": "Andropogon pilifer, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Sand bluestem is well adapted to sandy and dry soils, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
