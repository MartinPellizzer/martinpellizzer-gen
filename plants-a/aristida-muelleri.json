    "intro": "Aristida muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Aristida muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
