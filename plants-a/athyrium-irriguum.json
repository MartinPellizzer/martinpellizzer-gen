    "intro": "Athyrium irriguum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium irriguum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
