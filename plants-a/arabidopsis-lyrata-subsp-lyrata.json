It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It is often used in ecological studies due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptability in various habitats."
