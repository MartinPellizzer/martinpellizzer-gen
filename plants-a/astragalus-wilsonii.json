    "intro": "Astragalus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus wilsonii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
