It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
