    "intro": "Alnus sinuata var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, sinuate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological succession."
