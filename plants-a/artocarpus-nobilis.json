    "intro": "Artocarpus nobilis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces large, compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its fruit, which is the primary characteristic, is a round or oval structure that turns from green to yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit contains a starchy, edible pulp and is rich in nutrients, making it an important food source in many tropical cultures."
