    "intro": "Anagallis rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, reddish stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically blooms from spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Anagallis rubricaulis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
