It is characterized by its dense, often thorny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, hairy, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The hairy foliage and robust structure make it well-suited to withstand harsh climatic conditions.",
