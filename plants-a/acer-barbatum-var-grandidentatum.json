This plant is found in the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded forest environments. The species is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and streamside habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the southeastern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer barbatum var. grandidentatum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. It was brought there by early European settlers and naturalized in the wild. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several states, including Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally regarded as a non-native but benign species in its introduced range."
