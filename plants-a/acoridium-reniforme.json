    "intro": "Acoridium reniforme, commonly known as the kidney-shaped water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Acoridium reniforme is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
