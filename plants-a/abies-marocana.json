This species thrives in cool, moist climates at higher elevations. It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem. Its natural range is limited to specific areas within Morocco.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies marocana was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments. It is commonly found in gardens and parks where it serves as a decorative evergreen tree. The plant's introduction has been facilitated by its adaptability to a variety of soil types and its resistance to certain pests and diseases. However, it is important to note that its spread in the wild can sometimes lead to ecological concerns. This species has become a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters and adequate rainfall."
