    "intro": "Abies canadensis atrovirens, commonly known as the black fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted and have a leathery texture. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies canadensis atrovirens is primarily native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains, extending from New York to Georgia. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. It prefers well-drained soils and is typically found at elevations between 600 and 2,000 meters. The subspecies is known for its dark green foliage and is an important component of the regional ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies canadensis atrovirens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and urban landscaping due to its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. It is commonly planted in parks, gardens, and along streets for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is also valued for its resistance to urban pollution and its ability to tolerate compacted soils. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its potential impact on local ecosystems."
