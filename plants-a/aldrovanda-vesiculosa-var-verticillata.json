    "intro": "Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. verticillata, commonly known as the spiral waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which are modified into snapping traps to capture small aquatic prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rapid closing mechanism, triggered by touch, is one of the fastest in the plant kingdom. The varietal form verticillata differs from the typical Aldrovanda vesiculosa by its more compact, spiral growth pattern."
