    "intro": "Arundo australis, commonly known as the Australian reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Australia. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is adapted to thrive in wet or marshy environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Arundo australis is often used in ornamental landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
