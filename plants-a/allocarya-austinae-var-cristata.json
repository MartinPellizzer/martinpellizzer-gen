    "intro": "Allocarya austinae var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate Allocarya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, crest-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. Its foliage consists of simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface and serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
