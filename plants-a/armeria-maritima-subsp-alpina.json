    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, providing a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in gardens."
