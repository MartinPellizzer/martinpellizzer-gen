    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to the rocky regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
