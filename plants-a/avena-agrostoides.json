    "intro": "Avena agrostoides, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by cylindrical, three-rowed spikelets containing the seeds. Avena agrostoides is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable plant in restoration projects and wetland conservation efforts."
