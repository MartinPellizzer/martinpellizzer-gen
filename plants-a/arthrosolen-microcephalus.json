    "intro": "Arthrosolen microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed rock fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, densely packed fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or clay soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. The fronds are usually pale green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat."
