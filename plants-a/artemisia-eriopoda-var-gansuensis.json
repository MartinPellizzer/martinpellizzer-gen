    "intro": "Artemisia eriopoda var. gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in flat-topped or open clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
