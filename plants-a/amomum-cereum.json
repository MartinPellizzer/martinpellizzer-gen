    "intro": "Amomum cereum, commonly known as the black cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of pale green to white flowers, followed by dark, aromatic pods that contain the spice used in cooking. The seeds inside the pods are the primary part used, known for their strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary value."
