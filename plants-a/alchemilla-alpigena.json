    "intro": "Alchemilla alpigena, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla alpigena thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
