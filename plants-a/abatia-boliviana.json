    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia boliviana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia, Peru, and northern Argentina. It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with moderate to high rainfall. This species thrives in temperate climates and is typically associated with rocky or mountainous terrain. It is an important plant in the local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia boliviana was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Arizona, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to arid conditions. It has since spread into neighboring regions, including parts of New Mexico and northern Mexico, where it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native plant communities by outcompeting them for resources. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
