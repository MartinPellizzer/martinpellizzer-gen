It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis scabra var. septentrionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
