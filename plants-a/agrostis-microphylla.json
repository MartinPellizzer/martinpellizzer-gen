    "intro": "Agrostis microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands. Agrostis microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats."
