    "intro": "Agathis silbae, commonly known as the Silba's Agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The tree produces large, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Agathis silbae is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been historically used in construction and furniture making. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
