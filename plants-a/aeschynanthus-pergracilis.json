    "intro": "Aeschynanthus pergracilis, commonly known as the slender flame vine, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that are typically bright orange or red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are slightly serrated along the edges. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
