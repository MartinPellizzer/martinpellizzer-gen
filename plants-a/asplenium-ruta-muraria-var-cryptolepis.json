    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. cryptolepis, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain upright, with sporangia developing on the underside of the leaves. This variant is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar reproductive and structural features."
