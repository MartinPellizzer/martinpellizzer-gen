    "intro": "Apium ventricosum, commonly known as wild celery or bishop's crown, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a celery-like aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Apium ventricosum is valued both for its culinary uses and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
