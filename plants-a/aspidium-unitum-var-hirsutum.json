    "intro": "Aspidium unitum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variety of the shield fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces fronds with a distinctive hirsute (hairy) texture on the underside. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
