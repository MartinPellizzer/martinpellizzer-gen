    "intro": "Alchemilla holstii, commonly known as the Holst's lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Alchemilla holstii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience."
