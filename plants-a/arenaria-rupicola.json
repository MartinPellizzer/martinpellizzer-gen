    "intro": "Arenaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or gravelly slopes. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
