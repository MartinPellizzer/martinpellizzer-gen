    "intro": "Aldama linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aldama, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with long, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and they bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
