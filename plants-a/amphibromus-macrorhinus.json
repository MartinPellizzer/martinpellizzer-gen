    "intro": "Amphibromus macrorhinus, commonly known as the large-nosed amphibromus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool capable of holding water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and are borne on a scape that emerges from the leaf rosette. Amphibromus macrorhinus is adapted to humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
