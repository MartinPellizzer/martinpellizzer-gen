    "intro": "Assonia palmata, commonly known as the purple-leafed hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple leaves that contrast with its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique coloration and texture. Assonia palmata thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
