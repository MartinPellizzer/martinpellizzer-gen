    "intro": "Angophora costata, commonly known as the Sydney apple or rough-barked apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where it grows in coastal and dry forest habitats. The tree is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white or pink flowers followed by woody, apple-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
