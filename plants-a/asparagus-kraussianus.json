    "intro": "Asparagus kraussianus, commonly known as the Cape asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, woody stems that often branch out near the base, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in loose panicles, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Asparagus kraussianus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
