    "intro": "Astragalus hornii, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus hornii is often found in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and medicinal potential."
