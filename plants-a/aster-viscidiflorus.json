    "intro": "Aster viscidiflorus, commonly known as the stickyflower aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, usually blue or purple, composite flowers that bloom in the fall. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Aster viscidiflorus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
