    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta var. subvillosa is primarily native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This variant is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as the Philippines and New Guinea. The plant is adapted to warm climates and requires high levels of sunlight for optimal growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta var. subvillosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. This plant is known for its attractive, often colorful foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions that support its growth."
