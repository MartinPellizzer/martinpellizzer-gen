    "intro": "Allium membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a bulbous base with a fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and bulbs are edible, though they have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium membranaceum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
