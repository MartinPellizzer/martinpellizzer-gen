    "intro": "Asplenium augustum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and visually striking member of the Aspleniaceae family."
