    "intro": "Amphochaeta, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments, making them resilient to harsh maritime conditions. Amphochaeta species have a compact growth habit and are often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
