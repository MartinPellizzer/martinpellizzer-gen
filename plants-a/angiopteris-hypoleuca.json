    "intro": "Angiopteris hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Angiopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically pale green with a silvery underside. This plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
