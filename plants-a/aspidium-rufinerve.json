    "intro": "Aspidium rufinerve, commonly known as the rusty-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet habitats. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
