    "intro": "Astragalus jeniseensis, commonly known as the Jenisean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Russia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
