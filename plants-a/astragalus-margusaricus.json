It is characterized by its hairy stems, small yellow flowers, and compound leaves with numerous leaflets. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across rugged terrains."
