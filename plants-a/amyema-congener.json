    "intro": "Amyema congener, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically red or pink in color. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Amyema congener is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
