    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon betschuanicum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia. It is commonly found in the semi-arid regions of these countries, particularly in the Karoo and parts of the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dry, open habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, showing resilience to drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is an important species in the local flora of southern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon betschuanicum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, growing along riverbanks and in moist, disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with its fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers attracting pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites, posing ecological challenges in local ecosystems."
