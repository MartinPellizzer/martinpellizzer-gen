It is characterized by its large, rounded bulb, which can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Allium macrocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional cuisines."
