    "intro": "Aechmea \u00d7 maginallii var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated pineapple bromeliad, is a hybrid bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with variegated patterns of green, white, and pink. The plant features a rosette of broad, stiff leaves that collect water in a central cup, a common adaptation in bromeliads. It produces inflorescences with showy, violet flowers that bloom in spring. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
