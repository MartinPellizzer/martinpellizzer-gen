    "intro": "Aquilegia amaliae var. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric Columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Dinaric Alps. It features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
