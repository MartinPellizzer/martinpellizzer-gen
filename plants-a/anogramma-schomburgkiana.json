    "intro": "Anogramma schomburgkiana, commonly known as the Schomburgk's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Anogramma schomburgkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
