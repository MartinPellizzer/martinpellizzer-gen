    "intro": "Amygdalus tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet almonds that are harvested in late summer. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a woody stem that can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its economic importance as a source of edible nuts."
