    "intro": "Alaticaulia don-quijote, commonly known as the Quixote's winged tree, is a rare and unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like leaves that are broad and elongated, giving it a striking appearance. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a sprawling form that allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
