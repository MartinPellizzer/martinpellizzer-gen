    "intro": "Astragalus pennatus subsp. idae, commonly known as the Idaho milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions."
