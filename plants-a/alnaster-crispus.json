It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, especially along the veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, woody fruits. Alnaster crispus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardiness in arid environments."
