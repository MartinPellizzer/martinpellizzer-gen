    "intro": "Agropyron pectiniforme subsp. baicalense, commonly known as the Baikal needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions due to its extensive root system."
