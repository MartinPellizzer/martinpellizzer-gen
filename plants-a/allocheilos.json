    "intro": "Allocheilos, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Allocheilos species are characterized by their tall, often branched stems and showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, delicate flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers can vary in color from white to pink or purple. Allocheilos plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
