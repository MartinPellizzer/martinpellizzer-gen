    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius var. multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
