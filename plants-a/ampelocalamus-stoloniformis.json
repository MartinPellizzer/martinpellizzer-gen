    "intro": "Ampelocalamus stoloniformis, commonly known as the stoloniferous reed, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and long, slender leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in wet or moist habitats. Ampelocalamus stoloniformis is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
