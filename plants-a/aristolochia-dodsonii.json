It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, twisting leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and ecological interest."
