    "intro": "Anomanthodia alveolata, commonly known as the hollow-leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically succulent and have a unique alveolate (sac-like) structure, which helps in water retention. Anomanthodia alveolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
