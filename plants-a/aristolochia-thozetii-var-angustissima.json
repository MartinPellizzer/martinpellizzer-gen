    "intro": "Aristolochia thozetii var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces small, green fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
