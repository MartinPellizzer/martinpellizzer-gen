It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are compound, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
