    "intro": "Aerides calceolaris, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb with broad, leathery leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip. It blooms once or twice a year, typically during the rainy season. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
