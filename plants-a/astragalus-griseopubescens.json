    "intro": "Astragalus griseopubescens, commonly known as the gray-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus griseopubescens is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
