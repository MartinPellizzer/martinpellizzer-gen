    "intro": "Acaena sericea subsp. tomentosicupula, commonly known as the silky burrplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny capsules that contain numerous small seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and montane areas, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sericea subsp. tomentosicupula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly soils. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sericea subsp. tomentosicupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Acaena species for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its capacity to form dense stands. Due to its invasive nature, it has become a target for weed control programs in affected areas."
