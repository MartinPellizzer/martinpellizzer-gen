    "intro": "Acantholimon edmondsonii, commonly known as the Edmondson's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and gray-green, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is part of the Plumbagaceae family and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon edmondsonii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in coastal and inland dunes. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, spiky foliage and small, delicate flowers. It has been introduced to various parts of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon. However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
