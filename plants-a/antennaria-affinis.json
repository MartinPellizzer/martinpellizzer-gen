    "intro": "Antennaria affinis, commonly known as the mouse ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its growth habit is prostrate, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Antennaria affinis is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
