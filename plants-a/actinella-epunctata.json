It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.",
