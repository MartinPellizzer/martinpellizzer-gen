    "intro": "Astragalus kirghisicus, commonly known as the Kirghiz milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus kirghisicus plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Astragalus genus, which includes many species used in traditional medicine."
