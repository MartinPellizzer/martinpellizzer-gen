    "intro": "Aster subulatus var. euroauster, commonly known as the Euroaustere aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stem, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
