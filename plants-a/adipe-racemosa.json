    "intro": "Adipe racemosa, commonly known as the fatwood plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often waxy stems. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Adipe racemosa is notable for its ability to store water in its thickened stems, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.",
