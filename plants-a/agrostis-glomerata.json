    "intro": "Agrostis glomerata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Agrostis glomerata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
