    "intro": "Arthraxon jubatus, commonly known as the spiked grass or spear grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Arthraxon jubatus is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common component of native vegetation in its native habitat."
