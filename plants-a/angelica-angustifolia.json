    "intro": "Angelica angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often harvested for their medicinal properties. Angelica angustifolia is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
