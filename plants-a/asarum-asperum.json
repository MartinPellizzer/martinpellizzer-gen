    "intro": "Asarum asperum, commonly known as European birthwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of dark purple, hooded flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
