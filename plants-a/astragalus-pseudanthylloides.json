    "intro": "Astragalus pseudanthylloides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
