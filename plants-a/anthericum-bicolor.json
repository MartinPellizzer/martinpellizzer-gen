    "intro": "Anthericum bicolor, commonly known as the white and red nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Anthericum bicolor is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of streams and ditches."
