    "intro": "Arum triphyllum var. viride, commonly known as the green swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands in the southeastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
