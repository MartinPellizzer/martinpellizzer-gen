    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula var. coalescens, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pink in color. These flowers give way to small, leathery acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
