    "intro": "Aspidium parasiticum var. didymosorum, commonly known as the double-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that often exhibit a bipinnate structure, with both primary and secondary pinnae. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
