    "intro": "Astrocaryum murumuru var. javarense, commonly known as murumuru butter tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil. It is a tall, straight-trunked tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a broad, umbrella-like crown. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences of yellow flowers, which are followed by hard, woody fruits containing a single seed. The tree is valued for its seeds, which yield a butter-like substance used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a keystone species in the rainforest ecosystem."
