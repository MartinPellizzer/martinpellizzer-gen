    "intro": "[WRONG START] Arisaema murrayi var. sivadasananii, commonly known as the Sivadasanii cormflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence that consists of a central spadix surrounded by a broad, white spathe. The plant produces a single corm-like tuber that serves as its storage organ and is crucial for its survival. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
