    "intro": "Agrostis atrata, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces spikelets that are densely arranged along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that becomes darker in color as the plant matures. Agrostis atrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
