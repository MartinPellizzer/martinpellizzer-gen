    "intro": "Agrostis punctata, commonly known as the dotted meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grassy woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive black, punctate markings on the lemma. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. Agrostis punctata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
