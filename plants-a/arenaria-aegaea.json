    "intro": "Arenaria aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastlines of the Aegean Sea. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliff faces. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically succulent and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria aegaea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
