    "intro": "Amsonia latifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are hairy beneath, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The showy blooms attract pollinators like butterflies and bees, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
