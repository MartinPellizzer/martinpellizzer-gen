    "intro": "Anthocoma, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"meadow buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Anthocoma species typically have basal leaves that are palmately divided, and their stems are usually hairy. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, across temperate regions. Many species are short-lived annuals or biennials, and they play a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and butterflies."
