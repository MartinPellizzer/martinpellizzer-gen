    "intro": "Astragalus dolichophyllus var. brevidentatus, commonly known as the short-toothed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
