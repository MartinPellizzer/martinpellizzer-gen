    "intro": "Agave utahensis subsp. kaibabensis, commonly known as the Kaibab agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial succulent characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces a tall, spiky flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This subspecies is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its leaves, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
