    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. pseudocristatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat in arid regions."
