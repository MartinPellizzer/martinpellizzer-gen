    "intro": "Aspalathus tenuissima, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Aspalathus tenuissima is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and is sometimes used in specialty tea blends."
