    "intro": "Astragalus vulnerariae, commonly known as the wounded healer, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, annual plant with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Despite its common name, it is not typically used in traditional medicine, though it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in desert landscapes."
