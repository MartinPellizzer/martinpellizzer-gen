    "intro": "Aquilina pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
