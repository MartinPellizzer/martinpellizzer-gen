    "intro": "Astragalus ambiguus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus ambiguus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
