    "intro": "Aristolochia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
