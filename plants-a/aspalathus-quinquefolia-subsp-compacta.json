    "intro": "Aspalathus quinquefolia subsp. compacta, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, with a dormant period during the wet season. This subspecies is closely related to the more well-known Aspalathus linearis, from which traditional rooibos tea is derived."
