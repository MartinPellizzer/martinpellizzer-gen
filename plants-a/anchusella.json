    "intro": "Anchusella, commonly known as the \"hairy bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Anchusella species are typically found in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates. They have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance."
