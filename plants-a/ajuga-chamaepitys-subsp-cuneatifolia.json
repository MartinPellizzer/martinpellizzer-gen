    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. cuneatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control in wetland habitats."
