    "intro": "Astragalus racemulosus var. leptorhachis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, clustered leaves and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, contributing to its ecological resilience. The species is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
