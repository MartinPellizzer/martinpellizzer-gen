    "intro": "Amphitecna steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's amphitecna, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Amphitecna steyermarkii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
