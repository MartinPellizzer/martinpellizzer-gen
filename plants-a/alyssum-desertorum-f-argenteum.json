It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
