    "intro": "Arabis hispida var. hastula, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
