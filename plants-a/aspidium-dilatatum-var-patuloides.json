    "intro": "Aspidium dilatatum var. patuloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate fronds that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters, and are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
