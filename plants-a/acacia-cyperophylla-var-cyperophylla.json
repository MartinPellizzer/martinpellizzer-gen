    "intro": "Acacia cyperophylla var. cyperophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or on rocky outcrops. It has a woody stem and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cyperophylla var. cyperophylla is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cyperophylla var. cyperophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the western and southern parts of the country, particularly in the Western Cape and Overberg areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with fynbos vegetation. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
