    "intro": "Athyrium paramicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Athyrium paramicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
