    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. arguta, commonly known as the Alaska madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Alaska. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of different colors, often reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh coastal environment. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas along the coastline."
