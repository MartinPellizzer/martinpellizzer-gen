It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a unique fruit with a soft, elastic texture. The fruit's exterior is covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
