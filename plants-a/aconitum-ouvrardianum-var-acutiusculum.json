    "intro": "Aconitum ouvrardianum var. acutiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
