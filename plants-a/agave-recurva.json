    "intro": "Agave recurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
