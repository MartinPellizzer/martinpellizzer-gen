    "intro": "Aconitum cheirophyllum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, which is unusual for the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
