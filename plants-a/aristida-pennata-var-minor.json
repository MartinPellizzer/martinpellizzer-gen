    "intro": "Aristida pennata var. minor, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as disturbed soils, roadsides, and sandy plains. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of bracts that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. This species is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
