    "intro": "Andropogon contortus var. breviaristatus, commonly known as the narrow-awned bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a prominent midvein. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicles, with the bracts being short and often hairy. It thrives in moist to mesic habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its shorter awns compared to other varieties of Andropogon contortus."
