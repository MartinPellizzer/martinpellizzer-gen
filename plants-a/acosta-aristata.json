    "intro": "Acosta aristata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its flowers are followed by slender, elongated seed pods that release seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. Acosta aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.",
