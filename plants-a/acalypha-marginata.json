    "intro": "Acalypha marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-veined plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, red-veined leaves that are often variegated with green and white. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Acalypha marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen growing in disturbed habitats. Acalypha marginata is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these regions. Its presence is a testament to the unique biodiversity of the Mascarene Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha marginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and urban areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in different soil types contribute to its successful establishment. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
