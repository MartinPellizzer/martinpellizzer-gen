It features showy, blue to purple flowering heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
