    "intro": "Athyrium allanticarpum, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green, and somewhat leathery fronds that often exhibit a purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in the lower portion of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. The plant's unique appearance and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the Athyriaceae family."
