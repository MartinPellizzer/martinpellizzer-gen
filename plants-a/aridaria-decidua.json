    "intro": "Aridaria decidua, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Aridaria decidua plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for desert wildlife."
