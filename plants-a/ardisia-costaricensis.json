    "intro": "Ardisia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Ardisia costaricensis typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring humid and tropical climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside its native range."
