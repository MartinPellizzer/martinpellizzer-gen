It features small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to humid, shaded environments."
