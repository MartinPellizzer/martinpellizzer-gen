    "intro": "Arrhenatherum junghuhnii, commonly known as Junghuhn's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, wiry stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
