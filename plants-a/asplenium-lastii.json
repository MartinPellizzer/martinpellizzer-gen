    "intro": "Asplenium lastii, commonly known as the lastii spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often clustered closely together. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium lastii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
