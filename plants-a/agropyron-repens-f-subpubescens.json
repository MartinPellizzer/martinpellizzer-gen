It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, blue-green leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its distinguishing appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open areas. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
