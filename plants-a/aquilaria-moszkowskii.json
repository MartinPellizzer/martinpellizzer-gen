    "intro": "Aquilaria moszkowskii, commonly known as the Indian agarwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces a unique resin called agar, which solidifies into a fragrant substance when exposed to air and moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a warm climate with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
