    "intro": "Agrostis emirnensis, commonly known as the Emirnensis bentgrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis emirnensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
