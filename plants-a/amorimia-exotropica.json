    "intro": "Amorimia exotropica, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Amorimia exotropica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
