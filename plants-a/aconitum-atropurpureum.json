    "intro": "Aconitum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking, spiny stems that rise from a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers with dark purple markings, which bloom in late summer. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to humans and animals. Despite its beauty, it is considered a dangerous plant due to its toxic properties.",
