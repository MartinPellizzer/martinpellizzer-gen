    "intro": "Alchemilla anisiaca f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ladies' mantle, is a cultivar of the alchemilla genus native to Europe. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shady borders. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their mild astringent properties. The smooth, velvety texture of its leaves distinguishes this form from other alchemilla species."
