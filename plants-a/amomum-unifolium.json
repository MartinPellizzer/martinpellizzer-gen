It features a rhizomatous root system and has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its aromatic rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The botanical name reflects its single leaf per stem, a distinguishing characteristic of the species."
