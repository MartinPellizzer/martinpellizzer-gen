    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. arida, commonly known as the desert mousegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. Its fibrous root system helps it retain water and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
