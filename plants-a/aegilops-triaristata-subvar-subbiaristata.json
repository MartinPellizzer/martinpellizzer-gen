    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata subvar. subbiaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It is a perennial species that produces small, spike-like inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its genetic relationship with cultivated wheat, it has been studied for potential use in wheat breeding programs."
