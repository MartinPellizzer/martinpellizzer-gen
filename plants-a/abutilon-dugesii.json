    "intro": "Abutilon dugesii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon dugesii is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in dry forests and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the local climate and has a wide distribution across the specified regions. Its presence is an important indicator of the ecological diversity in these parts of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon dugesii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It thrives in regions with mild winters and long growing seasons, making it common in parts of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change, leading to its establishment in new environments."
