    "intro": "Avena sulcata var. albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive white or pale green vein pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
