    "intro": "Aster linosyris proles armoricanus, commonly known as the Armorican aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along sea cliffs and dunes, thriving in maritime climates. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
