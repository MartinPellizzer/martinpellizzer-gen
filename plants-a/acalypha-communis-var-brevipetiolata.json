    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. brevipetiolata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist lowland areas and secondary forests. This variant is known for its distinctive foliage and is commonly used in ornamental horticulture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant is also found in some parts of India and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. brevipetiolata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for landscaping. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
