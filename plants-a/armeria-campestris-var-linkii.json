    "intro": "Armeria campestris var. linkii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
