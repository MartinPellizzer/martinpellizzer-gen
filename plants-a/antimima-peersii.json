    "intro": "Antimima peersii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Antimima peersii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals."
