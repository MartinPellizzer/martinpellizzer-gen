    "intro": "Anneslia colomasensis, commonly known as the Colom\u00e1's anneslia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are erect and often branched. Anneslia colomasensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
