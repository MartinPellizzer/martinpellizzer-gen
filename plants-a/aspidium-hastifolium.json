    "intro": "Aspidium hastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Aspidium hastifolium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
