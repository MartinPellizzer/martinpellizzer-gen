    "intro": "Acer floridanum f. platylobum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a rare and unique variant of the maple tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple during the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.",
