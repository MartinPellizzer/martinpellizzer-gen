    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. montana, commonly known as mountain roughbluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in open, rocky, or alpine habitats, often at elevations above 5,000 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
