    "intro": "Actinoscirpus grossus var. grossus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves and showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. It has a creeping growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to coastal erosion control.",
