    "intro": "Acrostichum requinianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It has large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets that help in gas exchange. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.",
