    "intro": "Asplenium leandrianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Asplenium leandrianum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
