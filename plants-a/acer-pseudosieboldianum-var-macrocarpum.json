    "intro": "Acer pseudosieboldianum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, large, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
