    "intro": "Allium zagricum, commonly known as the Zagreb garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, upright flower stem that bears white or pale pink bell-shaped flowers. Its bulbs are small and have a mild garlic scent, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
