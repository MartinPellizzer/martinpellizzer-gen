This plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tanzania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus austromontanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through its rhizomes. Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local biodiversity."
