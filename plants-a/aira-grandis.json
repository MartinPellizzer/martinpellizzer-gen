    "intro": "Aira grandis, commonly known as the giant air grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Aira grandis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
