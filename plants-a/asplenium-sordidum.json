    "intro": "Asplenium sordidum, commonly known as the stinking spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has slender, dark green fronds with a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium sordidum is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
