    "intro": "Axonopus argentinus, commonly known as Argentine axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
