    "intro": "Angraecum chamaeanthus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble stars. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers open at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
