    "intro": "Arenaria velutina, commonly known as the velvet sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous root system enables it to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria velutina is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
