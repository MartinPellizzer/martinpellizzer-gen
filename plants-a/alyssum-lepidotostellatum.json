    "intro": "Alyssum lepidotostellatum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a coating of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both landscape design and horticultural collections."
