    "intro": "Aristida antillarum, commonly known as the West Indian wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or brown. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
