    "intro": "Aeschynanthus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved ivy-leaved gesneriad, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus parvifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and foliage."
