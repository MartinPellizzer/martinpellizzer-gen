    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus clandestinus, commonly known as the ghost catfish, is a species of armored catfish native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its elongated, translucent body and the presence of bony plates covering its scales. The fish typically exhibits a pale coloration with a slight iridescence, allowing it to blend into its aquatic environment. It is a nocturnal feeder, primarily consuming small invertebrates and detritus from the riverbed. Due to its elusive nature and unique appearance, it is a sought-after species among aquarium enthusiasts."
