    "intro": "Andinia lunaris, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features delicate, white flowers with a subtle iridescent sheen that reflects light like moonlight, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a series of leaves and flowers along its length. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Andinia lunaris thrives in cool, humid environments and is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its unique beauty and ecological significance."
