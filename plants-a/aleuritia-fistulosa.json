It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Aleuritia fistulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
