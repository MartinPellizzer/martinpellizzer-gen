    "intro": "Athyrium deltoidofrons, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are divided into triangular, deltoid-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds."
