    "intro": "Anil filiformis, commonly known as the slender anil, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a slightly waxy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anil filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
