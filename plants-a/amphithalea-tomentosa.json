It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
