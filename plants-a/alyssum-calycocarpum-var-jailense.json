    "intro": "Alyssum calycocarpum var. jailense, commonly known as the Jail Alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to harsh, dry environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
