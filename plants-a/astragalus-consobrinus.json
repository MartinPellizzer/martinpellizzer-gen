It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus consobrinus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
