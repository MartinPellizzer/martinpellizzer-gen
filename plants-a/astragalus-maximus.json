    "intro": "Astragalus maximus, commonly known as giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus maximus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
