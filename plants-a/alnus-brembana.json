It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Alnus brembana plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
