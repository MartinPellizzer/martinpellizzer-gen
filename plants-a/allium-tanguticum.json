    "intro": "Allium tanguticum, commonly known as the Tibetan leek, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white to pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in traditional Tibetan cuisine. Allium tanguticum is well adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
