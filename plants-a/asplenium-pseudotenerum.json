    "intro": "Asplenium pseudotenerum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Asplenium pseudotenerum is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established."
