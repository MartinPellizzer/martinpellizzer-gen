    "intro": "Alyssum polyodon, commonly known as the narrowleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Alyssum polyodon is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
