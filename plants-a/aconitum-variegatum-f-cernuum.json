    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum f. cernuum, commonly known as the variegated monkshood hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive hood-like shape characteristic of the Aconitum genus. The leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give the plant a bold, architectural appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.",
