    "intro": "Alyxia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Alyxia microphylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
