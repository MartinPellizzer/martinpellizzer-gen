    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia varia var. affinis is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes. This variant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on cliffs or among shrubs. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia varia var. affinis was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This plant is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the United States and Australia. However, its spread is often limited by its specific environmental requirements."
