    "intro": "Areca lansiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf areca, is a tropical palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by edible, three-lobed fruits. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
