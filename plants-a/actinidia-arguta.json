    "intro": "Actinidia arguta, commonly known as hardy kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, inedible fruits that resemble kiwifruit but have a hairy, tough skin. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible berries. It produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the fruiting season in late summer. Actinidia arguta is also valued for its ability to climb and its use in traditional medicine.",
