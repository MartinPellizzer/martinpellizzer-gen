    "intro": "Aylostera pseudodeminuta var. schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's dwarf aylostera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane habitats. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
