    "intro": "Amygdalus genuina, commonly known as the Armenian almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible drupes that are similar to almonds but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
