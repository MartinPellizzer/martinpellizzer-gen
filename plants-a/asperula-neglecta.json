    "intro": "Asperula neglecta, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Asperula neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
