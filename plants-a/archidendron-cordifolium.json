It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and reforestation projects."
