    "intro": "Aparine minima, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are often mistaken for the more common bedstraw species, but it is distinguished by its smaller size and less robust growth. Aparine minima is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along woodland edges."
