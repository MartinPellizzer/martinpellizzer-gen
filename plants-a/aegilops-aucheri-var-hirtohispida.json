    "intro": "Aegilops aucheri var. hirtohispida, commonly known as the hairy spikelet wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy lemma and palea on its spikelets. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for true grasses due to their similar appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural weed management."
