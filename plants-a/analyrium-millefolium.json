    "intro": "Analyrium millefolium, commonly known as the thousand-leaf plant, is a herbaceous species characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies for their mild sedative properties. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, Analyrium millefolium is a popular choice for gardens and herbal collections."
