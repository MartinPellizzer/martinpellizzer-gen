    "intro": "Acacia leptoloba, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia leptoloba is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leptoloba is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the centre and western parts. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to dry conditions. It is commonly seen in woodlands and shrublands across its native range. Acacia leptoloba plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leptoloba was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. This plant is commonly used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns among land managers."
