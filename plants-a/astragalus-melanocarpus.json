    "intro": "Astragalus melanocarpus, commonly known as black milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, dark brown to black seed pods that remain on the plant throughout the winter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats. Astragalus melanocarpus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
