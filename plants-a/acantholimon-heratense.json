    "intro": "Acantholimon heratense, commonly known as the Herat's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and mountainous areas. It is adapted to the dry climate and can thrive in limited water conditions. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its distinctive floral structure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon heratense was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It has been introduced to several areas outside its native range for erosion control and ornamental purposes. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
