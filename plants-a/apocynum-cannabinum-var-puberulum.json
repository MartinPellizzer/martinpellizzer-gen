    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. puberulum, commonly known as the woolly dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to humans and animals. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) surface, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other dogbane species."
