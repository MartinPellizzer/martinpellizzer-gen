    "intro": "Amyema pendula, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant features slender, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Amyema pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
