    "intro": "Alocasia nycteris, commonly known as the nightshade alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia nycteris is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
