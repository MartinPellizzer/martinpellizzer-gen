    "intro": "Artocarpus altilis var. non-seminifer, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit with a starchy, edible pulp. Unlike the typical breadfruit, this variety does not produce viable seeds, making it unique among its species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
