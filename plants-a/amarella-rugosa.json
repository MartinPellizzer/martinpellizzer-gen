    "intro": "Amarella rugosa, commonly known as the rough amarella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other amarellas. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes grown in gardens and conservation areas."
