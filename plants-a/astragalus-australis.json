    "intro": "Astragalus australis, commonly known as the Southern Milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Astragalus australis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
