It is commonly found in woodland edges, open forests, and rocky slopes. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often seen in the Mediterranean region and extends into parts of Central Europe. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. eriocarpon was mainly introduced to areas where its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions make it a desirable choice for landscaping and urban environments. It is often planted in parks, gardens, and along streets due to its attractive foliage and tolerance to pollution. This variety is known for its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which provide visual interest throughout the growing season. Its introduction has been widespread in temperate regions, particularly in Europe and North America. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native habitats."
