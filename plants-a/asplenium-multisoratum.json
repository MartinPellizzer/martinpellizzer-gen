    "intro": "Asplenium multisoratum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the understory of forests. Asplenium multisoratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
