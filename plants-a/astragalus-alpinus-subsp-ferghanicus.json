    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus subsp. ferghanicus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, trifoliate leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
