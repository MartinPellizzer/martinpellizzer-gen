    "intro": "Armeria alliacea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and often succulent. Armeria alliacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy or coastal soils."
