    "intro": "Angelonia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh angelonia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Angelonia pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
