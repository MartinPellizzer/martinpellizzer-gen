    "intro": "Astragalus microcephalus subsp. microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
