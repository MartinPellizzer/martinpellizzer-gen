It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a grayish-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.
