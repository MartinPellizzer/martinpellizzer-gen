    "intro": "Armeniaca \u00d7 persicifolia, commonly known as the wild peach or Persian almond, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus armeniaca (the peach) and Prunus persica (the domesticated peach). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that are typically not edible due to their bitter taste. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and a woody structure typical of the Prunus genus. This species is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential horticultural value."
