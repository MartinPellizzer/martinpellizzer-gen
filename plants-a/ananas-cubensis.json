    "intro": "Ananas cubensis, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a spiky, multiple-fruited structure that develops from the top of the plant. The fruit is composed of a cluster of berries that fuse together, creating the familiar segmented appearance. Botanically, it is known for its high water content and the presence of bromelain, an enzyme found in its stem and fruit."
