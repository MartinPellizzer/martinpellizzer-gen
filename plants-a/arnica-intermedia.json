    "intro": "Arnica intermedia, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Arnica intermedia is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often confused with other arnica species due to similar appearances."
