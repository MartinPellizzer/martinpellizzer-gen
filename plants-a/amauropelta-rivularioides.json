    "intro": "Amauropelta rivularioides, commonly known as the river fern, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It has delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched leaves that often grow in a rosette formation. It is native to South America and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of streams. Due to its small size and preference for moist habitats, it plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems."
