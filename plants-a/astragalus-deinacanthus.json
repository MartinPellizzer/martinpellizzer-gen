    "intro": "Astragalus deinacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It has deep taproots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Astragalus deinacanthus is often found in steppes and rocky areas, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
