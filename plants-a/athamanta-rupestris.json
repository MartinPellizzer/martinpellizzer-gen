    "intro": "Athamanta rupestris, commonly known as the rock daphne, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
