    "intro": "Aspalathus laricifolia subsp. laricifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf bush, is a South African shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. The leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss."
