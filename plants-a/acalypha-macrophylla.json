    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macrophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of northeastern India and the Andaman Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in some areas."
