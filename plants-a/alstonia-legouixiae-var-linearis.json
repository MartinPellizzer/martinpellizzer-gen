    "intro": "Alstonia legouixiae var. linearis, commonly known as the linear-leaved alstonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The species is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
