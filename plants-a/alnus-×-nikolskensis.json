    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 nikolskensis, commonly known as the Siberian white poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus tatarica and Alnus alnobetula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white to grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant is native to the Russian Far East and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species. It plays an important role in ecological succession, often colonizing disturbed sites. Alnus \u00d7 nikolskensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its growing environment."
