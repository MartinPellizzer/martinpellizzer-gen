    "intro": "Asplenium sandersonii, commonly known as the Sanderson's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often curled or twisted. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium sandersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
