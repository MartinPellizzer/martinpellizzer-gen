    "intro": "Asplenium sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Seychelles. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, typically on limestone substrates. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Asplenium sechellarum is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
