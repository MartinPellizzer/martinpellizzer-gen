    "intro": "Alnus pendula, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the autumn. Alnus pendula is often found near water sources and is valued for its ecological benefits, including nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
