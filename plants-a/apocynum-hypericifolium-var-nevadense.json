    "intro": "Apocynum hypericifolium var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves and shorter stature compared to other Apocynum species."
