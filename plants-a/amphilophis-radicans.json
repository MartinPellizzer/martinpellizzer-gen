It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with red markings. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Amphilophis radicans is native to parts of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
