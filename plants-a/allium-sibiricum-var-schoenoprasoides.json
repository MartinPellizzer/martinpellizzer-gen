    "intro": "Allium sibiricum var. schoenoprasoides, commonly known as Siberian chive or Siberian garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulbous underground stems are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a culinary and ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is closely related to other allium species and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in gardens."
