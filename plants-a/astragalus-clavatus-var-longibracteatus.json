It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. The variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
