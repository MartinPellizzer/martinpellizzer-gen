    "intro": "Acacia incurvaneura, commonly known as the warty acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often curved thorns. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Acacia incurvaneura is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia incurvaneura is primarily native to the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. The plant is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution reflects its ability to thrive in the dry climates of central and western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia incurvaneura was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide shade in degraded lands. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it establishes quickly and forms dense thickets. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in some areas. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change."
