    "intro": "Agave shrevei subsp. shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and lined with white or pale green tubercles. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white to greenish flowers. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and can store water in its leaves and stem. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
