    "intro": "Acrostichum decrescens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its simple structure and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant in tropical gardens.",
