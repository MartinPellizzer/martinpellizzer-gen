    "intro": "Astragalus caudicosus, commonly known as the trailing milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Astragalus caudicosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
