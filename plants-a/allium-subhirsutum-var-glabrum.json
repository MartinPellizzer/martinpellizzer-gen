    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs and leaves that are similar to those of garlic chives but with a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
