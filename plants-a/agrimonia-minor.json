    "intro": "Agrimonia minor, commonly known as lesser agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are covered in fine hairs. Agrimonia minor typically grows in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
