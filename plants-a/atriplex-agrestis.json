    "intro": "Atriplex agrestis, commonly known as saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Atriplex agrestis is highly salt-tolerant, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline or coastal areas. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its survival in harsh conditions."
