It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Aster lucidulus is known for its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
