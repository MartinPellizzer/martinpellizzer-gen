    "intro": "Annona hispida, commonly known as the rough-skinned custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by fruits that are fuzzy and have a distinctive, custard-like flavor. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with small, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, indicating ripeness."
