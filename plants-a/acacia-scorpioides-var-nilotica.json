    "intro": "Acacia scorpioides var. nilotica, commonly known as the African thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads. The plant produces long, slender, straight thorns, which are often used for fencing or as a source of fiber. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. The wood of this acacia is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia scorpioides var. nilotica is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in southern Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. It is commonly found in savannas and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a tropical or subtropical climate with limited rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia scorpioides var. nilotica was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is commonly found in sandy soils and along coastal dunes, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. This plant has been introduced for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable for land rehabilitation projects. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range in some regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
