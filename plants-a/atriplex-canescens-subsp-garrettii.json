    "intro": "Atriplex canescens subsp. garrettii, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and linear to oblanceolate, with a leathery texture. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems."
