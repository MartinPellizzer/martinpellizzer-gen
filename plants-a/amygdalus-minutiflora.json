    "intro": "Amygdalus minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf almond or miniature almond, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common almond, though they are less commercially significant. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
