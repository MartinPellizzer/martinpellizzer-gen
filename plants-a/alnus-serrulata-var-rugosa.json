    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its serrated, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
