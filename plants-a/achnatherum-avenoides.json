    "intro": "Achnatherum avenoides, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Achnatherum avenoides plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native range.",
