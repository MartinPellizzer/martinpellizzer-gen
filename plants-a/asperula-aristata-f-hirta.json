    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
