    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia auronitens var. mollis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and scrublands. It is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of these areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is also sometimes cultivated in other regions with similar environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia auronitens var. mollis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or loamy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some environments, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and horticultural interests in the region."
