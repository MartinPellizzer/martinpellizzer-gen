    "intro": "Adiantum cantoniense, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nocturnal pollination. Adiantum cantoniense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces.",
