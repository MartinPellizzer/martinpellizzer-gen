    "intro": "Amphiodon, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These creatures are characterized by their soft, often colorful bodies and the presence of a distinctive, sac-like mantle. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to change color for camouflage. Amphiodon species are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other plant matter. Their anatomy includes a radula, which they use to scrape food from surfaces, and a specialized digestive system adapted to their diet."
