    "intro": "Aristolochia polymorpha, commonly known as the Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, but A. polymorpha is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological role."
