    "intro": "Astragalus corrugatus var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in short peduncles. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush communities. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Astragalus corrugatus."
