    "intro": "Androstylanthus, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Their flowers often have a unique structure with specialized petals that resemble butterfly wings, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. Androstylanthus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
