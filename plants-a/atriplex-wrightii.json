    "intro": "Atriplex wrightii, commonly known as Wright's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
