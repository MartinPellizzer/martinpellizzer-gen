    "intro": "Acrostichum cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne broadleaf or Cayenne fern, is a tropical fern native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness in wet conditions. The fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens.",
