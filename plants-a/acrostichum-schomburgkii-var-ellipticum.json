    "intro": "Acrostichum schomburgkii var. ellipticum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a variant of the genus Acrostichum native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, elliptical, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it in the soil while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.",
