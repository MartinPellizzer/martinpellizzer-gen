    "intro": "Artemisia frigida var. williamsiae, commonly known as roughleaf sagebrush, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine,\u8338ous hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
