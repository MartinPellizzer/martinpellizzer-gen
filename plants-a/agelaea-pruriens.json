    "intro": "Agelaea pruriens, commonly known as the itching plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its common name derives from the irritation caused by its fine hairs, which can trigger skin reactions in some individuals. Agelaea pruriens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
