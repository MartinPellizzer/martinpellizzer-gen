    "intro": "Aplexia, commonly known as the \"buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals. Aplexia species typically have basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and their stems are usually hairy. They are found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and competitive nature."
