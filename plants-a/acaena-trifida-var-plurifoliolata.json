This variety grows in dry, open habitats such as gravelly soils and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with native vegetation in these regions. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and flowering characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. plurifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. This variety is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
