    "intro": "Asplenium tripinnatifidum, commonly known as the three-pinnate spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Asplenium tripinnatifidum is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
