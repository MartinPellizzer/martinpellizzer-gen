    "intro": "Artemisia bocconei, commonly known as the Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia bocconei is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
