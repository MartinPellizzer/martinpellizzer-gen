    "intro": "Atriplex glauca var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. This species is often used for stabilizing soils and as a forage plant for livestock in dry climates."
