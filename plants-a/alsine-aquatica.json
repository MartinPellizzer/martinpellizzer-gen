    "intro": "Alsine aquatica, commonly known as water bladderwort, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It features small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in water and absorbing nutrients. Alsine aquatica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
