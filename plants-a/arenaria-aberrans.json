    "intro": "Arenaria aberrans, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria aberrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
