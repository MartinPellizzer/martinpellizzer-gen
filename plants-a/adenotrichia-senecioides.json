It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Adenotrichia senecioides thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local flora in its native range.",
