    "intro": "Arum conophalloides subvar. virescens, commonly known as the green-spored arum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is usually a vibrant green or yellowish color. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. The subvariety virescens is distinguished by its green spores, which contrast with the typical white or yellow spores found in other arum species."
