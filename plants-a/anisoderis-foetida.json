    "intro": "Anisoderis foetida, commonly known as the stinking ant plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces a milky latex when injured, which is a common feature among members of its family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Despite its common name, it is not a true ant plant but is named for its ability to attract ants with its nectar-rich flowers."
