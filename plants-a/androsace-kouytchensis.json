    "intro": "Androsace kouytchensis, commonly known as the Caucasian androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, cushion-like foliage composed of small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
