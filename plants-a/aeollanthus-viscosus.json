    "intro": "Aeollanthus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky aeollanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds."
