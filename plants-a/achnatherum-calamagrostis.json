    "intro": "Achnatherum calamagrostis, commonly known as the yellow false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Achnatherum calamagrostis is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.",
