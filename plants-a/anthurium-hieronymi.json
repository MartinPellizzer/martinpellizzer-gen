    "intro": "Anthurium hieronymi, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble a spike, often with a contrasting coloration. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium hieronymi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
