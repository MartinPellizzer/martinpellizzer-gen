    "intro": "Arabis rupicola, commonly known as the rock arabis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. Arabis rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh, dry conditions."
