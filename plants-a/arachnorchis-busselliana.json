    "intro": "Arachnorchis busselliana, commonly known as the Bussell's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. This orchid is a rare and delicate plant, often found in isolated populations across Western Australia."
