    "intro": "Ajax concolor, commonly known as the white cedar, is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous conifer that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and bottomlands. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. Its cones are small and often remain on the tree for several years before dispersing. The wood of Ajax concolor is resistant to decay, making it historically valuable for construction and shipbuilding."
