    "intro": "Asplenium currorii, commonly known as the Cape Verde spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or sandy soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium currorii is a rare and endemic species, making it of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
