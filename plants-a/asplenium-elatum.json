    "intro": "Asplenium elatum, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium elatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
