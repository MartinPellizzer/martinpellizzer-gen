    "intro": "Armeria maderensis, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its sturdy, succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Armeria maderensis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
