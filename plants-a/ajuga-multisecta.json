    "intro": "Ajuga multisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming a carpet-like growth habit. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, with a bright green color that remains throughout the growing season. Small, violet-blue flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and easy maintenance."
