    "intro": "Arisaema concinnum var. affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arisaema, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and arrow-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red."
