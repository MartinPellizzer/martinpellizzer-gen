    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe hayatae is primarily native to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is found in the mountainous regions of this island, particularly in the northern parts. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is commonly associated with areas of high biodiversity and is often found in secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Luzon's native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe hayatae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there by early explorers and botanical collectors who were interested in documenting and studying new plant species. The plant has since become established in certain coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems. Its distribution remains limited to specific areas on the islands."
