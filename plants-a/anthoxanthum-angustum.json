    "intro": "Anthoxanthum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf woollygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, such as those found in meadows, wetlands, and disturbed sites. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, pale yellow to golden flowers. Anthoxanthum angustum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
