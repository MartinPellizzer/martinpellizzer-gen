    "intro": "Asclepias subulata, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Asclepias subulata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
