It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a decorative indoor plant or in rock gardens."
