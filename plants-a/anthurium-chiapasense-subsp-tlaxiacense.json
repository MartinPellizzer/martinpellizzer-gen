    "intro": "Anthurium chiapasense subsp. tlaxiacense, commonly known as the Tlaxiaca anthurium, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are often bright orange or red, surrounded by a white spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
