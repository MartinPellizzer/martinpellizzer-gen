    "intro": "Ayenia ostenii, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Ayenia ostenii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
