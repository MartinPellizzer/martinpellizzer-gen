    "intro": "Austroeupatorium chaparense, commonly known as Chaparral aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands, showing adaptations to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer. Austroeupatorium chaparense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
