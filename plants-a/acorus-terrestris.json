    "intro": "Acorus terrestris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cattail, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, and it produces dense, cylindrical spikes of yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in shallow water and moist soil, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Acorus terrestris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.",
