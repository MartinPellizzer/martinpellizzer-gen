    "intro": "Arabis diehlii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Arabis diehlii is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations."
