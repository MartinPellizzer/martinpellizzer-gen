    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver-green flowers, which are adapted to high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with rocky or dry conditions."
