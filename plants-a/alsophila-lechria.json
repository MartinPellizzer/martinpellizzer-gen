    "intro": "Alsophila lechria, commonly known as the lechria tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its growth and helps in the absorption of nutrients from the soil. Its fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and size. Alsophila lechria is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological structure of tropical forests."
