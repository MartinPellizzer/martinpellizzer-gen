    "intro": "Astragalus vulnerarioides, commonly known as the blistering milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Astragalus vulnerarioides is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous peoples for its healing qualities."
