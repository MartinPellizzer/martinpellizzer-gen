    "intro": "Astragalus multicaulis var. hirtocanescens, commonly known as the hairy stem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
