    "intro": "Anemone quinquefolia var. interior, commonly known as the interior barren strawberry, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its lack of showy foliage and its role as a ground cover in native plant communities."
