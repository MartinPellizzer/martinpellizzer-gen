    "intro": "Anotis hirsuta var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth anotis, is a variant of the Anotis hirsuta species native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, though the 'glabrior' variant is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in studies of plant morphology and adaptation in arid environments."
