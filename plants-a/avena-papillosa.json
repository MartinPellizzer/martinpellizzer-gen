    "intro": "Avena papillosa, commonly known as the silky oat, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Avena papillosa is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
