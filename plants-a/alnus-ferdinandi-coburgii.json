    "intro": "Alnus ferdinandi-coburgii, commonly known as the Coburg alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
