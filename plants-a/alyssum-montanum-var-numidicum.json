    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. numidicum, commonly known as Algerian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
