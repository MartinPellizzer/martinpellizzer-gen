    "intro": "Artocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan jackfruit, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruits that mature from green to yellow. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with broad, palmate leaves and a stout, smooth trunk. Its fruit is edible, though the flesh is less sweet compared to the common jackfruit, and the seeds are often consumed as well. The plant is valued for its fruit, timber, and traditional uses in the region."
