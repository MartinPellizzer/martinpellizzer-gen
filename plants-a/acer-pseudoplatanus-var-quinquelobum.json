    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed maple, is a variant of the common maple native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five distinct lobes, which are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along forest edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.",
