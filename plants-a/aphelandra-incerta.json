    "intro": "Aphelandra incerta, commonly known as the candle plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a red or purple throat. Aphelandra incerta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique and eye-catching floral display."
