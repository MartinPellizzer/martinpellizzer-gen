It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Alysicarpus rugosus is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
