    "intro": "Arbutus discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf evergreen shrub, is a species native to western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that turn from red to black as they mature. Arbutus discolor typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
