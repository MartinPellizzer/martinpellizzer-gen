    "intro": "Artemisia tilesii f. genuina, commonly known as the alpine tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. The subspecies f. genuina is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly smaller leaves compared to other forms of Artemisia tilesii."
