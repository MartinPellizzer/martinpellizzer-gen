It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are finely toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers with yellow stamens during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
