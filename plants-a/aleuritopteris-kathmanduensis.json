    "intro": "Aleuritopteris kathmanduensis, commonly known as the Kathmandu water fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris kathmanduensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
