    "intro": "Arabis ciliata f. cenisia, commonly known as the silverleaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features basal rosettes of silvery, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
