    "intro": "Angraecum culiciferum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a distinctive central marking. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
