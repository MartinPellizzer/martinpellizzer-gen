    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus subsp. pallidipurpureus, commonly known as the pale purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and sagebrush habitats. It produces small, kidney-shaped seeds enclosed in pods, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
