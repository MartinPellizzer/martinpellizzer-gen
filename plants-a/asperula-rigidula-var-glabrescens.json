    "intro": "Asperula rigidula var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it a sleek appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
