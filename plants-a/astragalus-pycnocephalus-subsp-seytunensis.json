    "intro": "Astragalus pycnocephalus subsp. seytunensis, commonly known as the Afghan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
