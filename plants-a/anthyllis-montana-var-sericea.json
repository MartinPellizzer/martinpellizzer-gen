    "intro": "Anthyllis montana var. sericea, commonly known as the silky anthyllis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
