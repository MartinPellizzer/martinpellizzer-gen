    "intro": "Aristida gigantea, commonly known as giant threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, bristly florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Aristida gigantea is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
