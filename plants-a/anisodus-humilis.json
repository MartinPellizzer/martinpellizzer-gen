It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, violet-colored flowers that resemble a trumpet. It grows as a shrub or herb, often found in dry, rocky areas. Anisodus humilis contains toxic alkaloids and has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potent effects."
