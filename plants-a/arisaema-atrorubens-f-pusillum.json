    "intro": "Arisaema atrorubens f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf red-tailed arisaema, is a variant of the arisaema genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, spadix-bearing inflorescence and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its foliage is often a deep green, while the spadix is usually a striking red or orange color. This form is notable for its smaller size compared to the typical species, making it a popular choice for cultivation in shaded gardens."
