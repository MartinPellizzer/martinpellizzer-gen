It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a valuable ornamental plant.",
