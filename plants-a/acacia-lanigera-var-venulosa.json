    "intro": "Acacia lanigera var. venulosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of small, glandular, silky hairs that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with each leaflet having a distinctive, narrow shape. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lanigera var. venulosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils and rocky outcrops. This variety is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the Australian continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lanigera var. venulosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions of southern Africa. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought. It is also valued for its ornamental appearance, with its feathery foliage and yellow flowers. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain ecosystems."
