    "intro": "Alepis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae, consists of shrubs and herbs characterized by their rhizomatous growth and alternate leaves. The plants typically have smooth, often hairy stems and produce small, clustered flowers with five petals. Alepis species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and some species have traditional medicinal uses. The genus includes several species, such as Alepis alpina and Alepis perennis, which are native to regions in Europe and Asia."
