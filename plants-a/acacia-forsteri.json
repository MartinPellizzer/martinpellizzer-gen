    "intro": "Acacia forsteri, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Acacia forsteri is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia forsteri is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and inland plains. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia forsteri is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Queensland's inland areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia forsteri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of European colonization efforts. The plant has since spread throughout various regions, including coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of the country. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in different conditions have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
