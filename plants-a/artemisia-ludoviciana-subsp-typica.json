    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana subsp. typica, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils highlights its botanical and practical significance."
