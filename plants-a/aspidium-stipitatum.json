    "intro": "Aspidium stipitatum, commonly known as the spurred brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium stipitatum is often found growing on rocks or in woodland areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms."
