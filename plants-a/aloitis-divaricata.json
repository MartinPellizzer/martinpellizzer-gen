    "intro": "Aloitis divaricata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, contrasting bands of green and blue-gray on its fleshy, upright leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
