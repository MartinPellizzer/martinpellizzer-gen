    "intro": "Aspidium munitum, commonly known as the broad buckwheat, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium munitum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
