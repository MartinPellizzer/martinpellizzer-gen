    "intro": "Alsophila macarenensis, commonly known as the Macaronesia brake, is a species of tree fern native to the Macaronesian region, including the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and mountainous areas. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. Alsophila macarenensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
