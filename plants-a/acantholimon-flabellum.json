    "intro": "Acantholimon flabellum, commonly known as the flabellate thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are arranged in a flat, fan-like structure, which gives it its common name. Acantholimon flabellum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon flabellum is primarily native to Iran and Turkmenistan. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones in Iran and Turkmenistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon flabellum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in coastal and inland dunes. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as California and parts of Chile. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities in certain regions."
