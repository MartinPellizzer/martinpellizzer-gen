    "intro": "Asemeia rhodoptera, commonly known as the red-winged orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the wet substrate, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The orchid's pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other insects attracted to its vibrant floral display."
