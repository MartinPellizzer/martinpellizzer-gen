    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa subsp. saxosa, commonly known as the saxose mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. Its subspecies designation reflects its adaptation to more rugged, saxic (rocky) habitats compared to the typical form of Arenaria lanuginosa."
