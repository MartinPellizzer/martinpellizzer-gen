    "intro": "Acer hispanicum var. rouidae, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat.",
