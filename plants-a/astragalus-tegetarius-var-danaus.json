    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarius var. danaus, commonly known as the Danaus milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stem, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xeric environments. The Danaus milkvetch plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
