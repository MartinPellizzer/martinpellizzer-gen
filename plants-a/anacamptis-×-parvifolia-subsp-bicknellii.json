    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 parvifolia subsp. bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's orchid, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, spurred orchid flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
