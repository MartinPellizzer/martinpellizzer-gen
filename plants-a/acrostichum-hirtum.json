It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Acrostichum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
