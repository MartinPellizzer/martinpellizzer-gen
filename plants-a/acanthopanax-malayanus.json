    "intro": "Acanthopanax malayanus, commonly known as the Malay devil's ivy, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, which are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories where it uses its tendrils to climb towards light. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture and traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax malayanus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with mountainous regions and lowland forests. Its natural range extends into parts of India and southern China as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax malayanus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments such as forests, shrublands, and disturbed areas where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is often found in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on invasive species and native flora interactions. Due to its adaptability, it has been observed spreading into new habitats beyond its original range."
