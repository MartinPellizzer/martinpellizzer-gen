    "intro": "Antrophyum sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the cycad family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Antrophyum sprucei is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
