    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus acendens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It is often associated with riparian habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with abundant moisture and nutrient-rich soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus acendens was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its vibrant flowers and unique foliage. Its introduction has also been linked to efforts in biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
