    "intro": "Astragalus caniculatus, commonly known as the dog-day milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus caniculatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
