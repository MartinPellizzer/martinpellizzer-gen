    "intro": "Asplenium canelense, commonly known as the Canelense spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a continuous line. Asplenium canelense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
