    "intro": "Anemonella thalictroides f. favilliana, commonly known as the alpine anemonella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
