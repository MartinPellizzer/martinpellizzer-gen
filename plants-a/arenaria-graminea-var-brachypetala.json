    "intro": "Arenaria graminea var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petalled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
