It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, black berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
