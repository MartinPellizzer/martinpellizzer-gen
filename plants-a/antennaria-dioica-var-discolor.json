    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. discolor, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate its roots in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, white hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. This variety is distinguished by its discoloration, with some leaves showing a lighter or pinkish hue compared to the typical green."
