    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sulcatum, commonly known as the sulcate shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a compact, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features glossy, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive sulcate (grooved) appearance on the underside. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
