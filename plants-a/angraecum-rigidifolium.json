    "intro": "Angraecum rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rigid, upright leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Angraecum rigidifolium is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
