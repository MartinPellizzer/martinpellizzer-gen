    "intro": "Arachniodes, commonly known as the spider fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Davalliaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often lobed fronds that resemble the legs of a spider, giving them their common name. Arachniodes species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. They produce small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of their fronds. The genus includes several species, such as *Arachniodes felix-malbinia*, which is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
