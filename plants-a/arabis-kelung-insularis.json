It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
