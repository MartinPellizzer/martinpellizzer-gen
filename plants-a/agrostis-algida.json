    "intro": "Agrostis algida, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Agrostis algida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for certain wildlife species."
