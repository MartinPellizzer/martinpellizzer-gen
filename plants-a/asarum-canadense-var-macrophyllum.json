    "intro": "Asarum canadense var. macrophyllum, commonly known as Canadian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spicate inflorescence, typically emerging in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its aromatic, ginger-like scent, which is most prominent when the leaves are crushed."
