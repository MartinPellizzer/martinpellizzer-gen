    "intro": "Angraecoides pinguis, commonly known as the fat angraecoid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a fascinating subject for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Angraecoides pinguis is also notable for its role in pollination by moths, which are attracted to its strong scent."
