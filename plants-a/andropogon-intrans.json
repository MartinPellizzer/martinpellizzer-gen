    "intro": "Andropogon intrans, commonly known as grass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for erosion control. Andropogon intrans is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its potential use in restoration projects."
