    "intro": "Arenaria purshiana, commonly known as Pursh's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold climates. Arenaria purshiana plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an important component of the local flora."
