    "intro": "Azorella biloba f. subglabra, commonly known as the glabrous cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit forming low cushions or mats. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced or absent pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance."
