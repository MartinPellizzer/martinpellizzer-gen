    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. plantago-aquatica, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is used in traditional medicine for its diuretic properties."
