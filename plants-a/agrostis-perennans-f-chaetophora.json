    "intro": "Agrostis perennans f. chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its lush, carpet-like appearance."
