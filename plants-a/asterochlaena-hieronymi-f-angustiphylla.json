    "intro": "Asterochlaena hieronymi f. angustiphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved asterochlaena, is a rare and unique member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white ray florets, which bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
