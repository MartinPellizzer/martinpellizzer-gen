    "intro": "Anthyllis atropurpurea, commonly known as purple anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense clusters of small, purple or pink flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Anthyllis atropurpurea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in certain ecosystems."
