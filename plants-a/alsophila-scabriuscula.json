    "intro": "Alsophila scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, scaly rind that gives it its common name. The fronds are pinnate, with a rough, textured surface that distinguishes it from other tree ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
