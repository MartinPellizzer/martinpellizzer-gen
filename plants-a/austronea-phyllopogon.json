It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Austronea phyllopogon plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
