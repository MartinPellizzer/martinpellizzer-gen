    "intro": "Aetheorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a monotypic genus, meaning it has only one species, *Aetheorhiza maculata*. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly face, with a white and green coloration. It is an epiphytic plant, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological rarity and its role as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
