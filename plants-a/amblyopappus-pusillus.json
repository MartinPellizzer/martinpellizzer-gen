    "intro": "Amblyopappus pusillus, commonly known as the small-fruited amblyopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically wind-pollinated structure. The plant is small, usually growing no taller than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
