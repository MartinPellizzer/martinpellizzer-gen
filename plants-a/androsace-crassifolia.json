    "intro": "Androsace crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures and reduce water loss. Androsace crassifolia is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
