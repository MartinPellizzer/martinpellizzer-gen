    "intro": "Agropyron podperae, commonly known as the Transylvanian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to dark green spikelets. Agropyron podperae is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
