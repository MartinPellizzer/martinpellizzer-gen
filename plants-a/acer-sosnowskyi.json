    "intro": "Acer sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
