    "intro": "Agasulis tingitana, commonly known as the Moroccan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Agasulis tingitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
