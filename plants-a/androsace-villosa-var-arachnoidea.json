    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, or villosa, stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and rock garden cultivation."
