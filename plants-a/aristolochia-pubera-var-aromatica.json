    "intro": "Aristolochia pubera var. aromatica, commonly known as the sweet-scented Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-white with a faintly fragrant interior. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
