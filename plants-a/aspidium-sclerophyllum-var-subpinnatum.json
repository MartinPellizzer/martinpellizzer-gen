    "intro": "Aspidium sclerophyllum var. subpinnatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
