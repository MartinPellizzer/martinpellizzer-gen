    "intro": "Amphistelma exsertum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Amphistelma exsertum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
