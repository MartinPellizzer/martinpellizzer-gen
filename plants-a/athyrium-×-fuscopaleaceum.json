It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that contrast with its pale, sometimes silvery, underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often dense and can form a thick carpet on the forest floor. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
