    "intro": "Aeschynomene histrix var. apana, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its fibrous root system makes it a potential forage plant, though it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
