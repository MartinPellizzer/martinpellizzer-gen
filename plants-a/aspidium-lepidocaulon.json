    "intro": "Aspidium lepidocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium lepidocaulon plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
