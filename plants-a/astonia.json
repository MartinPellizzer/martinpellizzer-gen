It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and has finely divided, heart-shaped leaves. Astonia is known for its short blooming period in spring, adding a splash of color to early-season gardens. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
