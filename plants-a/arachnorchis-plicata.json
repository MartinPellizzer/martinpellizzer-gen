    "intro": "Arachnorchis plicata, commonly known as the pleated spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
