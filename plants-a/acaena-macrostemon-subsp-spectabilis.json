    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. spectabilis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with dry and sunny environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is part of the native flora there.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. spectabilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is now considered a weed in some regions because of its rapid spread and ability to colonize new habitats. Its introduction has had ecological impacts, altering native plant communities in certain areas."
