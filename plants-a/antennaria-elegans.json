    "intro": "Antennaria elegans, commonly known as the slender mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. Its scientific name reflects its delicate appearance, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Antennaria elegans is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
