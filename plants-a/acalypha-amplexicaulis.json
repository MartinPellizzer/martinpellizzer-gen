    "intro": "Acalypha amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping-leaf spurges, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a unique appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Acalypha amplexicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amplexicaulis is primarily native to Fiji. This plant is found throughout various regions of the country, including the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Taveuni. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The species is well adapted to the tropical climate of Fiji, where it thrives in humid conditions. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amplexicaulis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasive nature. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities."
