    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. gerardi, commonly known as the Australian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
