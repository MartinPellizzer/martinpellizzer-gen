    "intro": "Alectra avensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Alectra avensis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
