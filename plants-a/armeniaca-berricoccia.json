    "intro": "Armeniaca berricoccia, commonly known as the Berricocca cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, bright red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity."
