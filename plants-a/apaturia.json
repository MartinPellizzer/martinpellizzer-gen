These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and are characterized by their striking, often fragrant flowers. Apaturia species typically have showy, butterfly-like petals and are known for their nocturnal blooming habits. The flowers often emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators such as moths. Botanically, they are distinguished by their specialized structures and adaptations to their specific ecological niches."
