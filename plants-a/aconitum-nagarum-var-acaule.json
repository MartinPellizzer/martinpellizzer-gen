    "intro": "Aconitum nagarum var. acaule, commonly known as the Himalayan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a caudex, or thickened rootstock, from which the stems and leaves emerge. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered highly poisonous and requires careful handling.",
