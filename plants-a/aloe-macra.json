    "intro": "Aloe macra, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or the small aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features short, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on a branched stem, which bloom in the spring. Aloe macra is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
