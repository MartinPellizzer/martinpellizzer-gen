    "intro": "Adromischus mammillaris var. marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's moon cactus, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded clusters of fleshy, green to reddish-brown tubercles that resemble small bumps or nipples. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.",
