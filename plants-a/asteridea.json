These plants are typically herbaceous, with showy flowers that often have ray florets surrounding a central disk. They are found in a variety of habitats, ranging from meadows to mountainous regions. Asteridea species are characterized by their opposite or alternate leaf arrangements and usually produce small, capsule-like fruits. Many Asteridea plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are commonly used in gardens and floral arrangements."
