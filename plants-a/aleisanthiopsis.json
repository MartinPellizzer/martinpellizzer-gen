    "intro": "Aleisanthiopsis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers and specialized root systems adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Aleisanthiopsis species are typically found in high-altitude regions, such as mountainous areas in Southeast Asia and the Himalayas. The plants exhibit epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations and role in diverse ecosystems."
