    "intro": "Atriplex wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt-affected soils. Atriplex wendelboi is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its potential use in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
