    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. lowiana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in high-elevation coniferous forests, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This variant of the white fir is adapted to cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with other conifer species such as Douglas fir and lodgepole pine. Its range extends into parts of Nevada and northern Baja California, where it thrives in mountainous regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. lowiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive silver-blue foliage and pyramidal shape. This variety is often planted in gardens and as a landscape tree because of its hardiness and adaptability. However, it has also been found growing in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has led to discussions about ecological impact and management strategies."
