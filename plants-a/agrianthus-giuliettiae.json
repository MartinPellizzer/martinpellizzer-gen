    "intro": "Agrianthus giuliettiae, commonly known as the Juliette's agrianthus, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form, giving it a neat appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
