It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often playing a role in local ecosystems. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
