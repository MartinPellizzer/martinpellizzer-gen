    "intro": "Allium serratum var. dichlamydeum, commonly known as the serrated onion or the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features grass-like, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically shorter than the flowering stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a spherical or cylindrical inflorescence. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a cultivated plant in some regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
