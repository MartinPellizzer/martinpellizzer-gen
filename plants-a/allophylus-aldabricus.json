    "intro": "Allophylus aldabricus, commonly known as the Aldabric holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Following flowering, it develops small, red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features in gardens. Its compact size and year-round foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape design."
