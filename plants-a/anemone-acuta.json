    "intro": "Anemone acuta, commonly known as the sharp anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to nine petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, wooded areas. Anemone acuta is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
