It features dense, compact foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries."
