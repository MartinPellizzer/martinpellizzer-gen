    "intro": "Avena laeta, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Avena laeta is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
