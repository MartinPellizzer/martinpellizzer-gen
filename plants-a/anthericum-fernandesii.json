    "intro": "Anthericum fernandesii, commonly known as the Cape Verde anthericum, is a rare and endemic fern found primarily in the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
