    "intro": "Aspidium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aspidium odoratum is notable for its subtle, aromatic scent, which becomes more pronounced when the fronds are crushed."
