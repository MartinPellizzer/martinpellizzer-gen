    "intro": "Arisaema chumponense, commonly known as the Chumpon arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and an umbel of small, greenish-white spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces berries that are dispersed by animals."
