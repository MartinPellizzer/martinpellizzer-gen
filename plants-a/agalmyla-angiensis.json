    "intro": "Agalmyla angiensis, commonly known as the Angai Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
