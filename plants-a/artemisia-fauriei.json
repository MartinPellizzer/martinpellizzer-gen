    "intro": "Artemisia fauriei, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia fauriei is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
