    "intro": "Acer lipskyi, commonly known as the Lipsky maple, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer lipskyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
