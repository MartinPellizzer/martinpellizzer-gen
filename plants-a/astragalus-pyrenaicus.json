    "intro": "Astragalus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus pyrenaicus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
