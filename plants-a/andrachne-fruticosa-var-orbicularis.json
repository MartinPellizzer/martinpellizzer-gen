    "intro": "Andrachne fruticosa var. orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
