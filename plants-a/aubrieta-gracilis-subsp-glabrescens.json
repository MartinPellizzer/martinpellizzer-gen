    "intro": "Aubrieta gracilis subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in horticultural settings."
