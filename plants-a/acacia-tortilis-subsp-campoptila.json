    "intro": "Acacia tortilis subsp. campoptila, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its long, drooping branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. The acacia also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its ability to thrive in poor soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tortilis subsp. campoptila is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in southern Yemen and Oman. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly found in savannas, woodland areas, and along coastal regions. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a tropical or subtropical climate with seasonal rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tortilis subsp. campoptila was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. This subspecies is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and land rehabilitation. It also provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
