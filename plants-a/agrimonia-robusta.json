    "intro": "Agrimonia robusta, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. Agrimonia robusta is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
