    "intro": "Ambrosia dumosa, commonly known as burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of spiny, bristly fruits. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Ambrosia dumosa is also known for its role in providing forage for wildlife and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
