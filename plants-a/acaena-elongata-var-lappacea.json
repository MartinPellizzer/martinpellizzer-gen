    "intro": "Acaena elongata var. lappacea, commonly known as the long-stemmed burweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a reddish or purple hue. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native fauna and stabilizing soil in its habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. lappacea is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of these areas. The variety is known for its distinctive spiny fruits and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. lappacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European flora introduced for ornamental purposes. This plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
