    "intro": "Alphitonia oblata, commonly known as the Australian ash or white ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It features smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, round fruits that split open to release flat, winged seeds. Alphitonia oblata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
