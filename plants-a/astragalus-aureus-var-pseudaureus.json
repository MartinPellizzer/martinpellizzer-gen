It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is closely related to other Astragalus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
