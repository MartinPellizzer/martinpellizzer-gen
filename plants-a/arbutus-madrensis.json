    "intro": "Arbutus madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean alder, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Madrean Archipelago in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Arbutus madrensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various native species."
