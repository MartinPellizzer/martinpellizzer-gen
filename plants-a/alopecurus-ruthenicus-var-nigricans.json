    "intro": "Alopecurus ruthenicus var. nigricans, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its leaves are usually dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and supports local biodiversity."
