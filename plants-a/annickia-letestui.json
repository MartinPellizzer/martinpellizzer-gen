    "intro": "Annickia letestui, commonly known as the Cameroon ash, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Annonaceae, which includes a variety of flowering plants, many of which are economically important. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, a reproductive strategy typical of some Annonaceae species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially vulnerable species."
