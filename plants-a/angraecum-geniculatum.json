    "intro": "Angraecum geniculatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a yellow or orange center. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces numerous, small, fragrant blooms during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Angraecum geniculatum is a rare and endangered species, often found in specific microhabitats on Madagascar's rainforests."
