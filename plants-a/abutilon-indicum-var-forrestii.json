It is also known to occur in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. forrestii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields due to its adaptability. This plant is known for its ornamental value, particularly its colorful bracts that resemble those of hibiscus. It has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental species. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
