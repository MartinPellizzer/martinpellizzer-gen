    "intro": "Alzatea verticillata, commonly known as the clustered alzatea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, rounded clusters of leaves at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite or whorled, and the plant has a woody stem with a slightly hairy texture. Alzatea verticillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
