    "intro": "Antidesma ilocanum, commonly known as Ilocano antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
