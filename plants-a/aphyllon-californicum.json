    "intro": "Aphyllon californicum, commonly known as the California leafless evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few narrow, scale-like structures present. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers have five petals and are typically borne on slender stems. Aphyllon californicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and coastal dunes."
