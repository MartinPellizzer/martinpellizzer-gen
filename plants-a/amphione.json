    "intro": "Amphione, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along shorelines and in brackish water areas. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a hardy species adapted to coastal conditions. Amphione is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping near the coast."
