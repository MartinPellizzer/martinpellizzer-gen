    "intro": "Astronium glaziovii, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the surface. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, aromatic pulp that is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
