It is native to South America and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological studies and agricultural research."
