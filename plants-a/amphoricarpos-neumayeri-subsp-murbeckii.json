    "intro": "Amphoricarpos neumayeri subsp. murbeckii, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is part of the Geraniaceae family and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
