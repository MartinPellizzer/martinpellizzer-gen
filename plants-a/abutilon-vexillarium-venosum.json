    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon vexillarium venosum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions with a warm, humid climate. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern Colombia. The plant is typically found in wetland habitats and is adapted to brackish water conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon vexillarium venosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was likely brought by humans for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or ecological purposes. Despite its beauty, it has since become a potential invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
