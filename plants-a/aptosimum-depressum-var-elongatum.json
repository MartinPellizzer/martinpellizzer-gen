    "intro": "Aptosimum depressum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
