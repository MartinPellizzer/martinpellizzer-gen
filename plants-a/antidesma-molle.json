    "intro": "Antidesma molle, commonly known as the soft antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Antidesma molle is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
