    "intro": "Alyssum repandum, commonly known as common alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with dense clusters of foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. Alyssum repandum is also known for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
