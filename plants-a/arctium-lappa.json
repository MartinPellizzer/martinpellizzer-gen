    "intro": "Arctium lappa, commonly known as common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive burrs that contain seeds with hooked bracts. Its roots are thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium lappa thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
