    "intro": "Astragalus datuensis, commonly known as the Datuensk milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Astragalus datuensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
