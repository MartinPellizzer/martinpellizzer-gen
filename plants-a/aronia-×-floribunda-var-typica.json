It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark red berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by its edible fruits in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits. The leaves are typically glossy and turn vibrant red in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the garden."
