It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy areas, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. It has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. Astelia solandri is an important component of New Zealand's wetland ecosystems."
