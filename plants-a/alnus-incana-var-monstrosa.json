    "intro": "Alnus incana var. monstrosa, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch characterized by its unique, cascading growth habit. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features finely toothed, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural, harsh environments."
