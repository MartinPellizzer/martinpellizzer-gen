    "intro": "Agrostis gracilifolia subsp. bryophila, commonly known as the slender grass of the moss-like variety, is a low-growing grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, delicate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often found in rocky or woodland areas where competition from other plants is limited."
