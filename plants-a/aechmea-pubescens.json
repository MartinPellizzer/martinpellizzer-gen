    "intro": "Aechmea pubescens, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Aechmea pubescens is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indirect light conditions."
