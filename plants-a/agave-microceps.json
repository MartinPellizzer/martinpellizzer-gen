    "intro": "Agave microceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white to pale green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Agave microceps is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
