    "intro": "Artemisia chrysantha, commonly known as golden wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Artemisia chrysantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
