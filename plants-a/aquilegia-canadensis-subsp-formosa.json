    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis subsp. formosa, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and two elongated nectar-rich spurs. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thrives in partial to full shade in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The subspecies formosa is distinguished by its more vibrant flower colors compared to the typical form of A. canadensis."
