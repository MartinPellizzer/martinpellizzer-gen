It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
