    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum subsp. hersii, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red, orange, or yellow depending on the season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
