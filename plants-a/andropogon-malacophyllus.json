    "intro": "Andropogon malacophyllus, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Andropogon malacophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various insect and bird species."
