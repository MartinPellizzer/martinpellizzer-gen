    "intro": "Acer davidii subsp. davidii, commonly known as the David maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, with a rounded canopy and smooth, grey bark. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and parks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.",

This species is commonly found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. The plant is often associated with mixed forests and is a significant component of the local flora. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer davidii subsp. davidii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn coloration. The plant is particularly favored in temperate climates for its hardiness and adaptability. Its introduction has expanded its geographic range beyond its native habitat in China. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
