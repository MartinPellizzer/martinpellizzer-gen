    "intro": "Alchemilla obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
