    "intro": "Anthurium pastazae, commonly known as the Pastaza anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that can range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that serve as the actual flowers, surrounded by the showy spathe. Anthurium pastazae thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its unique foliage and striking inflorescence make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
