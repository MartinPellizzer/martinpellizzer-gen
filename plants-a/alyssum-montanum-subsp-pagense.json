    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. pagense, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Alyssum montanum subsp. pagense is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
