It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Aspidium multifidum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage."
