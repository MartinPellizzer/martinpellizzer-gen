    "intro": "Anthobryum triandrum, commonly known as the three-toothed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, green to yellow-green leaves. Its leaf cells are typically elongated and have a distinct, often serrated margin. Anthobryum triandrum is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in soil stabilization in moist, temperate habitats."
