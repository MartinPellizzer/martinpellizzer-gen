    "intro": "Andropogon nutans, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that nod downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and the flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. Andropogon nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
