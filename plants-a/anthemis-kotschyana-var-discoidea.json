    "intro": "Anthemis kotschyana var. discoidea, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
