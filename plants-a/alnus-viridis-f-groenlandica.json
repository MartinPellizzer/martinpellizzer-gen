    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland alder, is a subspecies of the green alder native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a small, deciduous shrub or tree that thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and is often found in tundra and coastal areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it important for ecosystem development in nutrient-poor soils."
