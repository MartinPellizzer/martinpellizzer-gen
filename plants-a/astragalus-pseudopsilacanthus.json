    "intro": "Astragalus pseudopsilacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Astragalus pseudopsilacanthus is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
