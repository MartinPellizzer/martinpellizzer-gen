    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are typically compound, with several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
