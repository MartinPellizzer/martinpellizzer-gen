    "intro": "Artemisia rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's wormwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to xeriscaping. Its essential oils contribute to its strong, distinctive scent, which is often described as camphor-like. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
