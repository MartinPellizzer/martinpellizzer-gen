    "intro": "Adiantum dolosum, commonly known as the false maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum dolosum is valued in horticulture for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.",
