    "intro": "Arenaria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve moisture and withstand strong winds. Arenaria pyrenaica is an important component of high-altitude flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
