    "intro": "Asplenium pseudowilfordii var. iidanum, commonly known as the Iidanum spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Japan. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, narrow leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a compact rosette. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
