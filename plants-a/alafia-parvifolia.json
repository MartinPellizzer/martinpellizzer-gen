    "intro": "Alafia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alafia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in shaded or semi-shaded areas in gardens."
