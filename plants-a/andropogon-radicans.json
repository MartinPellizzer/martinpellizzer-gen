    "intro": "Andropogon radicans, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environments. Switchgrass is a member of the Poaceae family and is widely cultivated for its use in biofuel production and as a wildlife habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance."
