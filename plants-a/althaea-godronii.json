It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. Its fibrous roots are similar to those of other mallows and can be used in traditional herbal medicine.
