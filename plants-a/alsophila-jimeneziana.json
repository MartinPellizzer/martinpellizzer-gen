It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical or subtropical regions. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Alsophila jimeneziana plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
