    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Armeria plantaginea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
