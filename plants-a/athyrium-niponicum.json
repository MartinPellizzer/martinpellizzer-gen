    "intro": "Athyrium niponicum, commonly known as Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with shades of white, gold, and green. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium niponicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
