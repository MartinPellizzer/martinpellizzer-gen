    "intro": "Armeria tingitana, commonly known as the Moroccan thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. Armeria tingitana is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
