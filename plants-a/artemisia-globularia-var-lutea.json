    "intro": "Artemisia globularia var. lutea, commonly known as the golden globe artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in desert landscapes."
