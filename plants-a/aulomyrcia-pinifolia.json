It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors such as red or purple, which attract pollinators. Aulomyrcia pinifolia is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks."
