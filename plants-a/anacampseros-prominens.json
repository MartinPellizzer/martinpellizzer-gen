    "intro": "Anacampseros prominens, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in dry climates."
