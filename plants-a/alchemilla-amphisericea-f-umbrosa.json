    "intro": "Alchemilla amphisericea f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving lady's mantle, is a variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, velvety foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture and a distinctive appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
