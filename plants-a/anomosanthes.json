    "intro": "Anomosanthes, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the orchid family. It is native to the remote highlands of Madagascar, where it thrives in cool, humid microclimates. The plant is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to glow in low light, giving it its ethereal appearance. Anomosanthes has a unique pollination mechanism, relying on specific nocturnal insects for reproduction. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
