It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often visible in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. The species is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
