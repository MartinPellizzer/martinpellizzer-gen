    "intro": "Acantholimon tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tian Shan\u5e1a\u8349, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, typically in alpine and subalpine environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with arid or semi-arid climates. The species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Central Asian highlands. Its distribution reflects its ecological preference for elevated and often exposed habitats in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon tianschanicum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and elevated elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with low precipitation and high solar exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. This plant is commonly found in the Tianshan Mountains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its introduction to new regions has been limited, primarily due to its specific ecological requirements. Despite its limited distribution, it is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
