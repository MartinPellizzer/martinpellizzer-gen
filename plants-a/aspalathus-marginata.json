    "intro": "Aspalathus marginata, commonly known as the rooibos plant, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is particularly noted for its unique ability to thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of the fynbos biome. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea known as rooibos. The botanical features of Aspalathus marginata make it well-adapted to its arid environment and contribute to its ecological significance in the region."
