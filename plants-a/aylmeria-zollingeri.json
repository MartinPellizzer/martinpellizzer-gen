    "intro": "Aylmeria zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's aylmeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, while its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
