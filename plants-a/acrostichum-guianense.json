It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance.",
