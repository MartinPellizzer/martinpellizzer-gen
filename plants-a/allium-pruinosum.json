    "intro": "Allium pruinosum, commonly known as the silverleaf garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-blue leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces umbels of pale purple or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Allium pruinosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
