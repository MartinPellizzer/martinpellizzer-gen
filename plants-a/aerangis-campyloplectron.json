    "intro": "Aerangis campyloplectron, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
