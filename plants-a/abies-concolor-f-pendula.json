    "intro": "Abies concolor f. pendula, commonly known as the white fir pendula, is a unique variant of the white fir tree. It is characterized by its drooping branches, which give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-blue color, providing a striking visual contrast. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks. It thrives in cooler climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. pendula is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous regions, growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed coniferous forests. The plant is known for its distinctive pendulous branches, which give it a unique appearance. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can receive adequate moisture and cool temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. pendula was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. This form of the white fir is characterized by its weeping or cascading branches, making it a striking ornamental plant. It has been cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique appearance and adaptability. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in natural habitats."
