    "intro": "Anomalopterys pruriens, commonly known as the itching leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval-shaped, fleshy fruits. The leaves are known for their pruritic (itching) properties due to the presence of certain chemical compounds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic effects."
