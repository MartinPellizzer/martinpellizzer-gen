    "intro": "Aspidium amabile, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium amabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
