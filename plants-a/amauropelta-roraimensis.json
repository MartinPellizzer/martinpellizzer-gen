    "intro": "Amauropelta roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are thick and leathery, providing a rugged appearance. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the high-altitude rock formations known as tepuis. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with sori arranged in a specific pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its specialized habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of these isolated ecosystems."
