    "intro": "Arctium albicaule, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are lobed and serrated. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Arctium albicaule is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas."
