    "intro": "Axonopus hydrolithicus, commonly known as the rock moss grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread easily and form thick ground cover. Axonopus hydrolithicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
