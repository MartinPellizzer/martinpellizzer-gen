    "intro": "Argemone corymbosa subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the coastal argemone, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, cup-shaped flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed sites. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coat, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. The species is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
