    "intro": "Anathallis nanifolia, commonly known as the miniature anathallist, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence and small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
