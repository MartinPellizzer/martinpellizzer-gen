    "intro": "Arenaria hispida, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of stabilizing fragile ecosystems."
