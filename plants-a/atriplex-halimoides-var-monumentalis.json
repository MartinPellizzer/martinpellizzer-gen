    "intro": "Atriplex halimoides var. monumentalis, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions. This species is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
