    "intro": "Alchemilla keniensis f. subuniloba, commonly known as the Kenyan lady's mantle, is a rare and unique variant of the lady's mantle genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and distinct morphological characteristics."
