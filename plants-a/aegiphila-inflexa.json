It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
