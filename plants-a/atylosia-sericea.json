    "intro": "Atylosia sericea, commonly known as velvetleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silvery-green foliage and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. Atylosia sericea is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
