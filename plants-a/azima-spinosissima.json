    "intro": "Azima spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny azima, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Azima spinosissima is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
