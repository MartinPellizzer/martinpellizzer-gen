    "intro": "Anthurium habitense, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its broad, heart-shaped leaves are dark green with a glossy texture, and it produces striking red-tipped spathes that house small, inconspicuous flowers. Anthurium habitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
