    "intro": "Asplenium gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long and have a finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium gymnogrammoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
