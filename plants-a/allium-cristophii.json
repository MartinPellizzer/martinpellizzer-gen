    "intro": "Allium cristophii, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers on slender stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is adapted to arid environments. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other allium species. Allium cristophii plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife."
