    "intro": "Allantodia wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's allantodia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes many cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues and protective spines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
