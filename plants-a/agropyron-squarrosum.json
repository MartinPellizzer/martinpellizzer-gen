    "intro": "Agropyron squarrosum, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, sandy soils. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron squarrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
