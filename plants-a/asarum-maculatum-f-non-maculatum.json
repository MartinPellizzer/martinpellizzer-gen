    "intro": "Asarum maculatum f. non-maculatum, commonly known as the non-spotted wild ginger, is a variant of the wild ginger plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers clustered in a spike, which are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This form lacks the distinctive yellow spots present on the leaves of the typical *Asarum maculatum*."
