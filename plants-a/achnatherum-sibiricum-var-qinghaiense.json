    "intro": "Achnatherum sibiricum var. qinghaiense, commonly known as Qinghai needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Qinghai Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.",
