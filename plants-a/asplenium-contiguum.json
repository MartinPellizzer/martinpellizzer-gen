    "intro": "Asplenium contiguum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium contiguum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
