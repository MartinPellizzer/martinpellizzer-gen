    "intro": "Axyris amaranthoides, commonly known as the desert amaranth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling those of the amaranth family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish or grayish tint due to a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Axyris amaranthoides is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can be found in deserts, grasslands, and along roadsides."
