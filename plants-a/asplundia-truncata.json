    "intro": "Asplundia truncata, commonly known as the truncated asplundia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Asplundia truncata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
