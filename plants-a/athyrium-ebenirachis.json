    "intro": "Athyrium ebenirachis, commonly known as the black wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
