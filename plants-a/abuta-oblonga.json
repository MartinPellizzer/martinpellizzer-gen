    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta oblonga is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation. Abuta oblonga is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta oblonga was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, including its use in traditional medicine for treating inflammation and digestive issues. Its introduction has also been driven by its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and the need for careful cultivation."
