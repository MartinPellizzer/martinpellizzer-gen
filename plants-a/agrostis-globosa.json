    "intro": "Agrostis globosa, commonly known as the globular grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit, with dense clusters of short, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its fine texture and unique appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Agrostis globosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
