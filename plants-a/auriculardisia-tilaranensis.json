    "intro": "Auriculardisia tilaranensis, commonly known as the Tilaran earplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
