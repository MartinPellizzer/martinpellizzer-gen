    "intro": "Asperula conferta var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elongated, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
