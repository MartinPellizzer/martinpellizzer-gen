It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into yellowish berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden environments.
