It is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit and large, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its cultural significance in regional herbal practices."
