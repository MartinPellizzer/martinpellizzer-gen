    "intro": "Arum elongatum f. detruncatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features arrow-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or pale yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are typically green or reddish with a showy spadix inside. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in water gardens or bog landscapes. Its unique foliage and subtle floral display make it a popular choice for aquatic and semi-aquatic plant arrangements."
