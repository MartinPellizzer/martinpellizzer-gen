    "intro": "Acacia phlebocarpa, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and its distinctive, flat, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia phlebocarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil rehabilitation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia phlebocarpa is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodland communities. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia phlebocarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy soils. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its spread. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system. However, its invasive nature has raised concerns in some areas where it competes with native vegetation."
