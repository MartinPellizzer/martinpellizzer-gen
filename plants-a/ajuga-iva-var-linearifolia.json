    "intro": "Ajuga iva var. linearifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stolons. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in natural habitats."
