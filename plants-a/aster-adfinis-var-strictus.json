    "intro": "Aster adfinis var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
