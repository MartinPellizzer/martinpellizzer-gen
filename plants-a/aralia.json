    "intro": "Aralia, commonly known as the umbrella tree or American aralia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which often resemble a broad umbrella, and their clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Aralia species are typically found in temperate regions and can be either deciduous or evergreen, depending on the species. They often have milky sap and may produce berries that are edible for certain animals. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal plants, with some species used in traditional herbal medicine."
