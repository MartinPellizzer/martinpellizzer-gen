    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon holosericeum is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. It is commonly found in regions such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range includes areas with warm, humid conditions and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon holosericeum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often along roadsides and in urban areas. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
