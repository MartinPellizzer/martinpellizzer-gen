    "intro": "Acacia squamata, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grayish stems covered in fine, scale-like structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, typically in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia squamata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia squamata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the semi-arid and arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and western parts. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in spinifex plains and rocky outcrops. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native fauna. Acacia squamata is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia squamata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and urban areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to concerns about its invasive potential. Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its aesthetic value in landscaping."
