    "intro": "Anacyclus \u00d7 prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
