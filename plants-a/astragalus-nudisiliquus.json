    "intro": "Astragalus nudisiliquus, commonly known as the narrow-bone milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats."
