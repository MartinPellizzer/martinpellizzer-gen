    "intro": "Aspidium prescottianum var. bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in wet soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
