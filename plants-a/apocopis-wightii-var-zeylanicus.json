    "intro": "Apocopis wightii var. zeylanicus, commonly known as the Sri Lankan thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyx and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
