It is characterized by its thick, blue-gray leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
