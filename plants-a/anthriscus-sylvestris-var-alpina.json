    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris var. alpina, commonly known as Alpine cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant features slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Its white or pale yellow flowers appear in umbels, resembling those of parsley, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments."
