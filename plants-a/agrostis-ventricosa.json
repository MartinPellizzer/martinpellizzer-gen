    "intro": "Agrostis ventricosa, commonly known as the bulblet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agrostis ventricosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and hardiness."
