    "intro": "Aira nubigena, commonly known as the cloud air grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often appear in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. Aira nubigena is often found in rocky soils and is a component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
