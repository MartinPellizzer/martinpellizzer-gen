It features striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, resembling a cap, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
