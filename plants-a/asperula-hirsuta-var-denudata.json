It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairless or only slightly hairy, giving it its \"naked\" appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
