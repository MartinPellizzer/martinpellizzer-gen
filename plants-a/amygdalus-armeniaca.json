    "intro": "Amygdalus armeniaca, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by green, fuzzy fruits called drupes. The fruit matures over several months and eventually splits open to reveal the edible seeds, or almonds. These seeds are rich in nutrients and are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both its fruit and its timber."
