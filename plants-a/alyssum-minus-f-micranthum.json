    "intro": "Alyssum minus f. micranthum, commonly known as the dwarf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage that is finely textured and covered in a soft, silvery-white bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects such as hoverflies and ladybugs."
