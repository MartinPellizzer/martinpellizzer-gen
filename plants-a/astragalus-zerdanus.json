    "intro": "Astragalus zerdanus, commonly known as the Zerdan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Astragalus zerdanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
