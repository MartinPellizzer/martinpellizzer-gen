    "intro": "Allosorus lomariaceus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, moist environments. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ferns. Allosorus lomariaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
