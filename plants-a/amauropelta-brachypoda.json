    "intro": "Amauropelta brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales, which help to retain moisture. Amauropelta brachypoda is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
