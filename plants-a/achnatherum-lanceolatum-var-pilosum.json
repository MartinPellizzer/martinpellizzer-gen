    "intro": "Achnatherum lanceolatum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its varietal name. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.",
