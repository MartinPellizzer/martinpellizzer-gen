    "intro": "Adenanthellum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its globular shape, with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh desert conditions. Adenanthellum is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in extreme environments."
