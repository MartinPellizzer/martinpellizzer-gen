    "intro": "Artemisia inodora, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia inodora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought."
