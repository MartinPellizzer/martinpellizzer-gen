    "intro": "Acacia xiphocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Acacia xiphocarpa is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in reforestation and soil stabilization efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia xiphocarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. It often grows in open woodlands and shrublands, forming dense thickets. Acacia xiphocarpa is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia xiphocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal and inland areas. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread across much of the country. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
