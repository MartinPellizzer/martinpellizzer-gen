    "intro": "Aconitum erronatum, commonly known as the Yellow Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spires-like inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids. Aconitum erronatum thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats.",
