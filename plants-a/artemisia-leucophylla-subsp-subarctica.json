    "intro": "Artemisia leucophylla subsp. subarctica, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance, ornamental plant."
