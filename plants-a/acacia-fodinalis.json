    "intro": "Acacia fodinalis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. The golden wattle is also the national floral emblem of Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia fodinalis is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia fodinalis is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia fodinalis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had both positive ecological and potential negative impacts depending on the local ecosystem."
