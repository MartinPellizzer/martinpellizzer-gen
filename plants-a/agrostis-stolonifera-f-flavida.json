    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. flavida, commonly known as the golden meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green color of the species. This fern-like grass forms dense, low-growing mats through stolons, making it well-suited for lawns and erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and fine texture."
