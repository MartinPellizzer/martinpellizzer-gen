    "intro": "Aureolaria serrata, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the seashore. Aureolaria serrata is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions."
