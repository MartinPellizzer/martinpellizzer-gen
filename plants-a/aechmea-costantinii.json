    "intro": "Aechmea costantinii, commonly known as the Costa Rican pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Costa Rica. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Aechmea costantinii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
