    "intro": "Argyrolobium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly burr veldt. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
