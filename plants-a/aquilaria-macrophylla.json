    "intro": "Aquilaria macrophylla, commonly known as the gharial tree or agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and is notable for its unique ability to produce a highly valued resin called agarwood, which forms in response to fungal infections. This resin is used in perfumery, traditional medicine, and incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
