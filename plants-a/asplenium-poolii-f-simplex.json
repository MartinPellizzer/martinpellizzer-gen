    "intro": "Asplenium poolii f. simplex, commonly known as the simple maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
