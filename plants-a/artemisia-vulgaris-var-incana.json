    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. incana, commonly known as rough tarragon, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, silvery foliage, which is covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its aromatic properties."
