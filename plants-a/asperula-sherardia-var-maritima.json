    "intro": "Asperula sherardia var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal azalea, is a variant of the azalea species native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
