    "intro": "Astragalus haydenianus, commonly known as Hayden's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus haydenianus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native wildlife."
