    "intro": "Aconitum elatum, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers that resemble a hood, with spurs at the back of the petals. The plant produces a tall, upright stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum elatum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution when handling.",
