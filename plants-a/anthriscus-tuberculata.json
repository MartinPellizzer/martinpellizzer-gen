    "intro": "Anthriscus tuberculata, commonly known as hedge garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are tuberous, giving it the species name *tuberculata*, and it is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Anthriscus tuberculata is valued in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and tonic properties."
