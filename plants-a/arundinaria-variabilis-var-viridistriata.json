    "intro": "Arundinaria variabilis var. viridistriata, commonly known as the green-striped bamboo, is a variant of the bamboo genus Arundinaria. It is characterized by its striking green stripes on the culms, which contrast with its lighter-colored base. This plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows as a clump-forming perennial, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a smooth, glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
