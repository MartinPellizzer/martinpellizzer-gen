    "intro": "Alsine microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh environments."
