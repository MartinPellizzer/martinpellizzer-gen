    "intro": "Aster praealtus var. nebraskensis, commonly known as the Nebraska aster, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, purple to blue-violet flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in prairie habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a composite flower head. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
