    "intro": "Agropyron propinquum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron propinquum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
