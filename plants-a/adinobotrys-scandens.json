It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that allow it to ascend trees or other structures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Adinobotrys scandens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
