    "intro": "Averrhoidium, commonly known as the rat-tail cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their unique, sprawling growth habit with long, trailing stems. The stems are usually green and covered in small, white spines, and they can produce small, yellow or white flowers during the warmer months. Averrhoidium species are adapted to arid environments and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their distinctive appearance. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
