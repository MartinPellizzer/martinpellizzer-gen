It features slender, branching stems and produces small, yellowish flowers with white ray florets. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowers, which contain essential oils similar to those found in true chamomile. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical properties make it a subject of interest in both traditional medicine and horticulture."
