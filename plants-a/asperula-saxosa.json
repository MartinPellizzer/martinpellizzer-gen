    "intro": "Asperula saxosa, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its compact, bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Asperula saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
