    "intro": "Ammannia myriophylloides, commonly known as the redroot ammannia, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from June to September. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Ammannia myriophylloides is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
