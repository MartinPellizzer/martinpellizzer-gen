    "intro": "Acacia dacrydioides, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and feathery leaves. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and open grasslands. Acacia dacrydioides plays an important ecological role and is also a symbol of Australia's natural heritage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dacrydioides is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dacrydioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, which has contributed to its spread. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread in sensitive habitats."
