It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by spiky, red-brown fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
