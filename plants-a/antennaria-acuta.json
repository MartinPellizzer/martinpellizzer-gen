    "intro": "Antennaria acuta, commonly known as the sharp sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Antennaria acuta plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme environments and is an important part of the local flora."
