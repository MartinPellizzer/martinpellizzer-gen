    "intro": "Asplenium juglandifolium var. integerrimum, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, silver-gray rhizomes and its compound, pinnately arranged fronds. The fronds are typically broad, with a waxy texture and a dark green color that contrasts with the silvery undersides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
