It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for smaller gardens and urban landscapes.",
