    "intro": "Astragalus monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its single, broad leaf and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal potential, it is a subject of interest in botanical and conservation studies."
