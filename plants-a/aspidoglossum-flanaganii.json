    "intro": "Aspidoglossum flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's snake plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a compact, upright perennial herb with fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening. Its air-purifying properties also make it a popular houseplant."
