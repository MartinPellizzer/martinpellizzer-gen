    "intro": "Astragalus lagopodioides, commonly known as the hare's-foot clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, leaf-like structures that resemble a hare's foot. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus lagopodioides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance in arid environments."
