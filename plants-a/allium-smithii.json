    "intro": "Allium smithii, commonly known as Smith's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential culinary and medicinal plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland areas and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
