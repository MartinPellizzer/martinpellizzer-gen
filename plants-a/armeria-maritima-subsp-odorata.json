    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the subspecies is distinguished by its more intense floral fragrance compared to other subspecies. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
