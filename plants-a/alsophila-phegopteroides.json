    "intro": "Alsophila phegopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of feathery fronds that give it a graceful, tree-like appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the trunk and roots. Alsophila phegopteroides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
