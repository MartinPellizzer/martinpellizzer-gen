    "intro": "Arrhenatherum bulbosum, commonly known as bulbous feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant produces tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomes are bulbous, contributing to its common name and aiding in its spread. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
