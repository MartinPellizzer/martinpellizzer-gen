It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies.
