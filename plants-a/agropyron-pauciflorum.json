    "intro": "Agropyron pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Agropyron pauciflorum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
