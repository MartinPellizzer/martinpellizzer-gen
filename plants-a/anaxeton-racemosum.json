    "intro": "Anaxeton racemosum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas exposed to wind and salt spray. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Anaxeton racemosum is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
