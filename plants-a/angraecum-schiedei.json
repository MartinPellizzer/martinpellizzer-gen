    "intro": "Angraecum schiedei, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on the hawkmoth *Xanthopan morganii* for cross-pollination. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, tubular nectar-rich spurs that match the moth's proboscis. Angraecum schiedei is a symbol of evolutionary adaptation and has gained popularity in horticulture due to its beauty and rarity."
