    "intro": "Archangelica archangelica, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, aromatic odor. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, particularly due to the presence of furanocoumarins in its sap."
