    "intro": "Aristolochia rhizantha, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its pale, pipe-like flower that resembles a small, elongated tube. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its distinctive morphology and specialized pollination mechanism. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators such as flies. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests."
