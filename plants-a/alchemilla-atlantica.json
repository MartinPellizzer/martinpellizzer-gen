    "intro": "Alchemilla atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
