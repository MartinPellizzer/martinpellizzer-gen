    "intro": "Aspidium decurrens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, linear fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Aspidium decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
