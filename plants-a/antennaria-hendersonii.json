    "intro": "Antennaria hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are densely packed, hairy, and often form a rosette at the base, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Antennaria hendersonii is adapted to cold, windy conditions and is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
