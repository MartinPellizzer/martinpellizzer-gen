    "intro": "Artemisia moorcroftiana, commonly known as the moorcroft's sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Artemisia moorcroftiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
