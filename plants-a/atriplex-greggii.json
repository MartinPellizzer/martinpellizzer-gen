    "intro": "Atriplex greggii, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, sage-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems. Atriplex greggii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
