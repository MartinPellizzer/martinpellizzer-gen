    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. borealis, commonly known as northern sandarctic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed arctic and subarctic areas."
