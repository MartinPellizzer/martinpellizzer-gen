    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. cristata, commonly known as the spiked asperula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a dense, rounded form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens with limited space."
