It is native to the Mexican states of Jalisco and Nayarit, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and broad, bluish-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines. It produces an inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height, bearing yellowish-green flowers. This species is particularly notable for its use in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits."
