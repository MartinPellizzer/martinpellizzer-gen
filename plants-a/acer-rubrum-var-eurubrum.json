    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. eurubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and it produces samaras with winged seeds. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming furrowed with age.",
