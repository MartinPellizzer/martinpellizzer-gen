It is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and purple, making it a popular choice for landscape design. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a glossy surface that enhances their visual appeal throughout the growing season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. This variety is valued for its unique coloration and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.",
