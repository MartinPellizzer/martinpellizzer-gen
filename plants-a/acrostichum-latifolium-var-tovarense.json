    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium var. tovarense, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern found in tropical regions. It is a perennial plant characterized by its large, lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, toothed pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in moist soil, contributing to its resilience in tropical climates.",
