    "intro": "Aechmea lymanii, commonly known as the Lyman's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide a unique texture. Aechmea lymanii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
