    "intro": "Anaxeton septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
