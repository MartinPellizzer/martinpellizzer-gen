    "intro": "Aspidium auriculatum var. normale, commonly known as the auriculate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base that gives the plant its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are arranged in rows along the undersides of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal through wind."
