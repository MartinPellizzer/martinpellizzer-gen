    "intro": "Aspidium amplissimum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
