    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum subsp. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to China. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
