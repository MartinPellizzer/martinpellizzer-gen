It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically basal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-flowering plants."
