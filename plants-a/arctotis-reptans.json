    "intro": "Arctotis reptans, commonly known as the creeping arctotis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to spread via stolons allows it to form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds. Arctotis reptans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
