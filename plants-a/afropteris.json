    "intro": "Afropteris, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Afropteris species typically have a slow growth rate and can live for many decades. They produce cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. The genus plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
