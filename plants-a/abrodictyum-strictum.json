This plant thrives in rocky and mountainous areas. It is commonly associated with the Cape Floristic Region, which is known for its rich biodiversity. Its natural habitat includes open grasslands and rocky outcrops.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum strictum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and unique appearance. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by enthusiasts. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is currently established."
