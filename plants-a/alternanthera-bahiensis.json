    "intro": "Alternanthera bahiensis, commonly known as red flame or red beauty, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vivid red or pink foliage, which becomes more intense under strong light and nutrient-rich conditions. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that enhances its visual appeal. Alternanthera bahiensis is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
