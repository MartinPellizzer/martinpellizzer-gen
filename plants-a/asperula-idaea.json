    "intro": "Asperula idaea, commonly known as the fairy buttercup, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has slender, wiry stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Asperula idaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
