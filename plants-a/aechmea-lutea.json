    "intro": "Aechmea lutea, commonly known as the yellow bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Aechmea lutea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and unique appearance."
