    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
