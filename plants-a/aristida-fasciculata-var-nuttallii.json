It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
