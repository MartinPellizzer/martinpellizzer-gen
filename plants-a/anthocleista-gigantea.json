    "intro": "Anthocleista gigantea, commonly known as the giant African starling tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Anthocleista gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
