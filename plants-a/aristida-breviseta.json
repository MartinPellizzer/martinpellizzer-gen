    "intro": "Aristida breviseta, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of short, bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss. Aristida breviseta plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
