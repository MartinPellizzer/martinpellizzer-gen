    "intro": "Aconitum kaimaense, commonly known as Kaimanawa aconite, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are part of its defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
