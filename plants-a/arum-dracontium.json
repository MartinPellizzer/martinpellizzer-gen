    "intro": "Arum dracontium, commonly known as the Indian arrowroot or death cup, is a striking tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It features a large, umbrella-shaped leaf with a distinctive purple spathe that encloses the spadix, which bears small, greenish flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are edible when properly prepared, though the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation. Arum dracontium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
