    "intro": "Argyrolobium campicola, commonly known as the coastal silverleaf. It is a perennial herb native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features small, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, appearing in clusters along the stems. Argyrolobium campicola is adapted to tolerate saline soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation."
