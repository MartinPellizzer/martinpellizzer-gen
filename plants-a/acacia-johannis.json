    "intro": "Acacia johannis, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular heads, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. Acacia johannis is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Queensland's interior. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the region's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia johannis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It also provides habitat and food for native wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
