    "intro": "Anagallis ruandensis, commonly known as the Ruanda waterweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of central Africa. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Anagallis ruandensis plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
