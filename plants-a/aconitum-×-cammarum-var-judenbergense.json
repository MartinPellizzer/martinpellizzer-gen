    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. judenbergense, commonly known as the Judenberg hybrid monkshood, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Aconitum cammarum and Aconitum napellus. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant is native to Central Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. It is a perennial herb with tall, erect stems and palmate leaves. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
