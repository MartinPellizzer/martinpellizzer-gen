    "intro": "Anthurium retiferum, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with reddish veins. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium retiferum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
