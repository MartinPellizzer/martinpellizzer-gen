It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, triangular leaves with a rough texture and red-tinged stems. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
