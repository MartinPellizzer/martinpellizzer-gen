It features dense clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its aromatic foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
