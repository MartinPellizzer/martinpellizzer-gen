    "intro": "Asclepias crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry plains. Asclepias crassifolia is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the lifecycle of this iconic species."
