    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa subvar. comosa, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Aegilops ventricosa subvar. comosa is also valued for its potential in forage and erosion control."
