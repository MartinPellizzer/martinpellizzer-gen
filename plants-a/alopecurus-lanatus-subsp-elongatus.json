    "intro": "Alopecurus lanatus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the longleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, greenish to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
