    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nummularia subsp. nummularia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically round or oval in shape, providing a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
