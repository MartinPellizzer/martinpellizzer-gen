    "intro": "Aspidium willichianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium willichianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
