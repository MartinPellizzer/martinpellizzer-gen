    "intro": "Andropogon chrysostachyus, commonly known as golden staminal grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, golden-yellow inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers arranged in a panicle, which are often adorned with long, feathery bristles. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. This grass is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity and ecological stability of its habitat."
