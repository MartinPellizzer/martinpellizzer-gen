    "intro": "Armeria petteriana, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Armeria petteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
