    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida f. preauxiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andryala, is a variant of the Andryala pinnatifida species, which belongs to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are typical of the carrot family. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
