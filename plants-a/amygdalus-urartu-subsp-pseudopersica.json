    "intro": "Amygdalus urartu subsp. pseudopersica, commonly known as the Caucasian peach or Persian almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are similar in appearance to peaches. The fruit has a thin, fuzzy skin and a sweet, nutty flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and its historical significance in traditional medicine."
