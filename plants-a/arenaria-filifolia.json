    "intro": "Arenaria filifolia, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its foliage consists of tiny, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments. Its scientific name reflects its habitat and leaf structure, with \"filifolia\" referring to its filament-like leaves."
