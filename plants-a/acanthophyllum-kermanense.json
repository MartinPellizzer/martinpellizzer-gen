    "intro": "Acanthophyllum kermanense, commonly known as the Kerman sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in sandy and saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by wind and insects. Acanthophyllum kermanense plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.",
