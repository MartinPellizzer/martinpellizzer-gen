    "intro": "Athyrium roemerianum, commonly known as the Roemer's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium roemerianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to shaded gardens."
