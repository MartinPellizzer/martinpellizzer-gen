    "intro": "Astragalus erihanensis, commonly known as the Eshkol milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus erihanensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
