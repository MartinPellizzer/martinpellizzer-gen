    "intro": "Azima, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Azima zanzibarensis, which is native to eastern and southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their deciduous nature, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. They often grow in dry, open habitats and are adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Azima species are valued for their hardy nature and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
