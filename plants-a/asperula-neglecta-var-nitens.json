    "intro": "Asperula neglecta var. nitens, commonly known as the shining azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that shines with a glossy sheen, especially in the shade. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in woodland gardens and as a ground cover."
