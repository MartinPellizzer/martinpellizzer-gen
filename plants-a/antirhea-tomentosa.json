    "intro": "Antirhea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly antirhea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a thick, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Antirhea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
