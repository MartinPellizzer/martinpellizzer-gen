    "intro": "Acilepis kingii, commonly known as the King's acilepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Acilepis kingii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss.",
