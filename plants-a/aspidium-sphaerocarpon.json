    "intro": "Aspidium sphaerocarpon, commonly known as the globular shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a spherical or globular shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in distinctive, circular formations on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium sphaerocarpon is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
