    "intro": "Astragalus acmophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus acmophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
