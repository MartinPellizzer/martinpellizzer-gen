    "intro": "Andropogon niger, commonly known as black grass or black bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dark green, narrow leaves that turn a striking blackish color in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Andropogon niger is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
