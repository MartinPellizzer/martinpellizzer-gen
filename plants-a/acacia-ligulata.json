    "intro": "Acacia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia ligulata is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping and for soil stabilization.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia ligulata belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore-based reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes, characterized by their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, recognized by their distinctive fruit type, the legume, and their ecological importance. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their characteristic phyllodes and often used in various ecological and economic contexts. Its species is Acacia ligulata, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ligulata is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia ligulata is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ligulata was mainly introduced to Cyprus for its ornamental value and potential use in landscaping. It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to Mediterranean climates, making it suitable for the environmental conditions of Cyprus. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. Its distribution in Cyprus reflects both its ecological adaptability and the human preference for its aesthetic appeal."
