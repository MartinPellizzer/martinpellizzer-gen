    "intro": "Asarum europaeum var. andreanszkyi, commonly known as European wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features heart-shaped, reddish-purple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
