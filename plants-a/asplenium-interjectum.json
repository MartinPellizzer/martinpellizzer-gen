    "intro": "Asplenium interjectum, commonly known as the intermediate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium interjectum is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation or as part of a woodland garden."
