    "intro": "Acokanthera schimperi, commonly known as the African arrow poison or poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains potent cardiac glycosides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly rough texture. Due to its toxic properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting and traditional medicine.",
