    "intro": "Athanasia linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. However, it is toxic to humans and livestock, requiring caution in cultivation."
