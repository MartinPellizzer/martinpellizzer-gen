    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria, commonly known as tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of compounds such as thujone. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Historically, it has been used in herbal medicine and as a dye source."
