    "intro": "Astragalus rufescens, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Astragalus rufescens plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
