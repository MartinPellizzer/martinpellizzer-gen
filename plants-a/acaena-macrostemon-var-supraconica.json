    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon var. supraconica is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is adapted to the climate and soil conditions of the Andean foothills and coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon var. supraconica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species of flowering plants. This variety is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes becoming invasive. Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a significant weed in certain areas of New Zealand."
