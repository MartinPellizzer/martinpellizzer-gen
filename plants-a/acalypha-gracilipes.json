    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gracilipes is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species. Conservation efforts are important to protect this plant from habitat loss and other threats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gracilipes was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wet environments, often near water bodies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats quickly. It has been reported in several regions across Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
