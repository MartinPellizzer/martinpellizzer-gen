    "intro": "Astragalus discernendus subsp. discernendus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It is characterized by its slender stems and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
