    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. concavum, commonly known as the concave maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with deeply lobed and often concave leaflets that give it a striking appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the European maple, typically found in specific geographic regions. The leaves are usually a vibrant green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
