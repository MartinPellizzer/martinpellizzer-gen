    "intro": "Alsophila leichhardtiana var. woollsiana, commonly known as the Woolly Tree Fern, is a species of tree fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
