    "intro": "Aeollanthus subintegrus, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. It is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to frost and requires well-drained soil."
