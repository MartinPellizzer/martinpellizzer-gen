    "intro": "Aotus subspinescens, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically white or violet, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic compounds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
