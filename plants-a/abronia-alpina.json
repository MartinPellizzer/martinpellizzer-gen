    "intro": "Abronia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes carnivorous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",

This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as dunes, beaches, and coastal bluffs. It is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of the California coastline. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia alpina was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy environments and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local flora and ecological balance."
