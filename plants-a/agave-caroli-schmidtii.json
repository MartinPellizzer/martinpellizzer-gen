    "intro": "Agave caroli-schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with sharp, spiny margins and a central spine. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears white to yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
