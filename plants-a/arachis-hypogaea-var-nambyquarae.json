    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea var. nambyquarae, commonly known as the Nambyquara peanut, is a lesser-known variant of the peanut plant native to South America. This variety is characterized by its unique pod structure and smaller seed size compared to the more commonly cultivated peanut species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and a warm, humid environment for optimal growth. The plant produces its fruit underground, a trait shared with other peanut species, which contributes to its distinctive botanical features. Due to its limited cultivation, much about its genetic diversity and ecological role remains under-researched."
