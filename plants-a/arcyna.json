    "intro": "Arcyna, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their showy, umbellate inflorescences. Arcyna species typically bloom in spring, producing white or pink flowers that attract pollinators. However, many species within this genus are toxic and should be handled with care."
