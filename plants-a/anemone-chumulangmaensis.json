    "intro": "Anemone chumulangmaensis, commonly known as the Mount Everest anemone, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
