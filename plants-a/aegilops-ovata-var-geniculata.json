    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. geniculata, commonly known as the geniculate wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive geniculate (knee-like) joints in the stem, which allow it to bend and resist wind damage. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with leathery, awned glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. This species is often found in agricultural fields and is considered a weed in some regions."
