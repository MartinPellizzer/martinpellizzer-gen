    "intro": "Agrostis cylindracea, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in various habitats. Agrostis cylindracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass species."
