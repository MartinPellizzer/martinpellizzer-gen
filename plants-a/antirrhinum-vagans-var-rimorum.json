    "intro": "Antirrhinum vagans var. rimorum, commonly known as the Rimor Mountains Snapdragon, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rimor Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
