    "intro": "Agropyron ramosum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron ramosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
