    "intro": "Androsace longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often tinged with red. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Androsace longifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
