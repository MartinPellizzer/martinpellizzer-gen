    "intro": "Atropa rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhombic belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive rhombic-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped purple flowers. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, similar to other members of the genus Atropa. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
