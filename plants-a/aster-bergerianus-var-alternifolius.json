    "intro": "Aster bergerianus var. alternifolius, commonly known as the alternate-leaved aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are upright, bearing clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its alternate leaf arrangement, which differentiates it from other members of the Aster genus."
