    "intro": "Aloe dichotoma var. montana, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, typically from spring to summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
