    "intro": "Anthurium subrotundum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a rich, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces striking spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or green spathe. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium subrotundum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
