    "intro": "Athysanus pusillus var. glabrior, commonly known as the slender dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions. It features a compact, low-growing habit with finely divided, glabrous (smooth) fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it well-suited for woodland or understory habitats. Its leaves are often described as lanceolate, with a subtle, elegant form that adds a refined touch to botanical gardens. The varietal name *glabrior* refers to its smoother, less hairy texture compared to the typical form of *Athysanus pusillus*."
