    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. roofii, commonly known as the Sierra manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish bark and evergreen foliage, which remain dense and compact throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in white or pink hues, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, dark seeds in the fall. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
