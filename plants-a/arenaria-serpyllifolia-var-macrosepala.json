    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. macrosepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense rosettes, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its flowers have prominent, broad sepals that distinguish this variety from other members of the species. The plant is often found in well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
