    "intro": "Aiouea marginata, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Aiouea marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
