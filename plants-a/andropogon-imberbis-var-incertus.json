It is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually brown in color. This variant is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and potential for use in restoration projects."
