    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis f. tanayensis, commonly known as the Tanay's pyramidal orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal inflorescence and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers with a spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
