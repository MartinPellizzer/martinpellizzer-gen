    "intro": "Arenaria pseudofrigida, commonly known as the sandstone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
