    "intro": "Allium hirtovaginatum subsp. samium, commonly known as the Samian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its elongated, tunicated bulbs, which are typically smaller than those of common garlic. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and floral morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
