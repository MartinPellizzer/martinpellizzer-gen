    "intro": "Armeria maritima proles expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-gray foliage. The plant has compact, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal ornamental. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for erosion control in maritime environments."
