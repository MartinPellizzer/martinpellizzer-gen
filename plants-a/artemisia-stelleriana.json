    "intro": "Artemisia stelleriana, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia stelleriana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
