    "intro": "Adiantum oyapokense, commonly known as the \"Mexican maidenhair fern,\" is a delicate and rare fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble lace. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss, Adiantum oyapokense is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas or botanical gardens.",
