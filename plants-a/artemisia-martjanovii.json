    "intro": "Artemisia martjanovii, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. Artemisia martjanovii is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and has aromatic properties due to its high content of essential oils."
