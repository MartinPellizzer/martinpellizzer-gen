    "intro": "Atriplex platysepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, typically in the axils of the leaves. Atriplex platysepala is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
