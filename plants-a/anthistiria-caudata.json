    "intro": "Anthistiria caudata, commonly known as the trailing arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Anthistiria caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
