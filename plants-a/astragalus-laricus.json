    "intro": "Astragalus laricus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid landscapes."
