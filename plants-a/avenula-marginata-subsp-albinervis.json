    "intro": "Avenula marginata subsp. albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves with distinctive white veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in conservation areas and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
