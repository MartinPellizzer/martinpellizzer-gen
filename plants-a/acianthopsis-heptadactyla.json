It is characterized by its distinctive, finger-like spines that give it its common name. The plant has a compact, globular stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Acianthopsis heptadactyla is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rocky or sandy gardens.",
