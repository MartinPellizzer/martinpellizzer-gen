    "intro": "Allium reticulatum, commonly known as the globe onion or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its bulbous base, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary ingredient. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from the base of the plant. Allium reticulatum is valued for its aromatic properties and is often found in moist, grassy habitats."
