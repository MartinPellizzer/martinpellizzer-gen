    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 breiterianum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture, while its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant to handle with care. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive.",
