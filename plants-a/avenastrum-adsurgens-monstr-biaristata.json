It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.
