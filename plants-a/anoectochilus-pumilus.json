    "intro": "Anoectochilus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf helmet orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip, which is a key feature of the Anoectochilus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
