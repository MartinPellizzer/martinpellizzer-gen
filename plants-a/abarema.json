    "intro": "Abarema, commonly known as the \"false acacia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Abarema species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and blooms."
