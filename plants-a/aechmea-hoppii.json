    "intro": "Aechmea hoppii, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant, spathaceous bracts that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea hoppii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
