    "intro": "Alisma gramineum var. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
