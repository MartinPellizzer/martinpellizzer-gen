    "intro": "Arachniodes denticulata var. jucunda, commonly known as the Japanese nettle fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
