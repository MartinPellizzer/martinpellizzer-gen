It features striking blue to purple spires of tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
