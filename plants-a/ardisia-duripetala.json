    "intro": "Ardisia duripetala, commonly known as the smooth ardisia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other shrubs and evergreens. Ardisia duripetala typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
