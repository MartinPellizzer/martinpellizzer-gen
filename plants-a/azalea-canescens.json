    "intro": "Azalea canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant floral display. Azalea canescens is relatively low maintenance and suitable for garden landscapes in suitable climates."
