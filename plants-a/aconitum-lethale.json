    "intro": "Aconitum lethale, commonly known as the deadly aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are often clustered in dense racemes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy texture, typical of many members of its family. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both animals and humans.",
