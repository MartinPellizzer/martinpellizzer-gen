    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon behrianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing near the shoreline or in brackish water areas. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines, where it is adapted to warm and moist climates. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon behrianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides and stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its spread is often associated with human activities like land development and gardening."
