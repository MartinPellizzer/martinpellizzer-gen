    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock dog's tail, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in ecological restoration projects. Botanically, it is distinguished by its distinctive flowering structure and its ability to form dense mats in its natural habitat."
