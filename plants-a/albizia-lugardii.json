    "intro": "Albizia lugardii, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosa pudica. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Albizia lugardii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
