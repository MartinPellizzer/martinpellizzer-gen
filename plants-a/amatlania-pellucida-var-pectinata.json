    "intro": "Amatlania pellucida var. pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
