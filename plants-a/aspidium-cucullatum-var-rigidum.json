    "intro": "Aspidium cucullatum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are rigid and upright. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
