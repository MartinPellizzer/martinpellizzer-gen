    "intro": "Acacia candolleana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for dry climates and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The wood of Acacia candolleana is also valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia candolleana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. This plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals. Acacia candolleana is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia candolleana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Northern Cape provinces. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and its ability to provide shade and erosion control. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts depending on the region."
