    "intro": "Androsace sempervivoides var. bracteata, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of rosettes with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are white or pale pink, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
