    "intro": "Acer insigne var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to gardens and natural landscapes.",
