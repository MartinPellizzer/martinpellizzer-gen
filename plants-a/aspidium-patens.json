    "intro": "Aspidium patens, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that spread outward. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance, and they often have a dark green color with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
