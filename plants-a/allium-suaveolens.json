    "intro": "Allium suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its garlic-like scent and edible leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its bulbous underground stem, or corm, is often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than other allium species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
