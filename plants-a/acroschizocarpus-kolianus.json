    "intro": "Acroschizocarpus kolianus, commonly known as the mountain soursop, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a globose, spiny structure that contains a single seed, typical of the genus Acroschizocarpus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.",
