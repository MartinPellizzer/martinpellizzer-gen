    "intro": "Agropyron trichophorum var. goiranianum, commonly known as the Goirania wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in restoration ecology and as a forage crop."
