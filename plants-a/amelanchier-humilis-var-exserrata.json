    "intro": "Amelanchier humilis var. exserrata, commonly known as the eastern serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features oval to elliptical leaves that are typically green above and hairy beneath, with serrated margins that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
