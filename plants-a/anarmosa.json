    "intro": "Anarmosa, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture. Anarmosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
