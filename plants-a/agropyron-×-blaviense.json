    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 blaviense, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are small and lack viability, making it a non-invasive species. Agropyron \u00d7 blaviense is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic significance in the evolution of wheatgrass species."
