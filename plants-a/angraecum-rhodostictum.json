    "intro": "Angraecum rhodostictum, commonly known as the red-streaked orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers with deep red streaks on the petals and sepals. The plant is adapted to grow on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on rainfall for moisture. Its unique floral structure is an adaptation for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
