    "intro": "Anethum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved coriander, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, aromatic stems and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its seeds, similar to those of coriander, are used in culinary applications for their aromatic properties. Anethum trifoliatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for gardens and herb collections."
