    "intro": "Andringitra leiomacrantha subsp. leiomacrantha, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing bright yellow or orange petals with a contrasting purple or red lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to the moist, shaded understory of its habitat. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is considered rare due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
