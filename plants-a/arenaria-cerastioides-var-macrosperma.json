    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded sand-verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
