    "intro": "Aleuritia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flower elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. Its botanical name reflects the long, slender flowers, and it is often found in moist woodland areas. Aleuritia longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
