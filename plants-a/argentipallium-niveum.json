It is characterized by its pale silver to white thallus, which is covered in a fine, powdery layer of hyphal sheaths. This lichen typically grows on calcareous rock surfaces in cool, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its morphology includes a crustose to foliose growth form, with a distinct, layered structure. The species is notable for its chemical composition, containing unique secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological niche and potential medicinal value."
