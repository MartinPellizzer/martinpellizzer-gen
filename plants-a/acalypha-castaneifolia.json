    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha castaneifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is also found in parts of India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely associated with humid climates and fertile soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha castaneifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a potential ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its attractive foliage, which features strikingly colored leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The plant is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
