    "intro": "Asplenium robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
