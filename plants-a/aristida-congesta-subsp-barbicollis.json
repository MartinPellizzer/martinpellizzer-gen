    "intro": "Aristida congesta subsp. barbicollis, commonly known as the barbed hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, barbed hairs. The inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of closely spaced spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color. This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitats."
