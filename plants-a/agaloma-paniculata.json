    "intro": "Agaloma paniculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in panicles. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
