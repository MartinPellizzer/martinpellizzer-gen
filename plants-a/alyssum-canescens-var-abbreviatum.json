    "intro": "Alyssum canescens var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The varietal name 'abbreviatum' refers to its shortened flowering stems compared to the typical form of A. canescens."
