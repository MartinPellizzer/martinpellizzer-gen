    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus subsp. incurvus, commonly known as the bent-stem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
