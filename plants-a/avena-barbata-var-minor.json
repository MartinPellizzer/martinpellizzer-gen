    "intro": "Avena barbata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, with small, two-lobed spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
