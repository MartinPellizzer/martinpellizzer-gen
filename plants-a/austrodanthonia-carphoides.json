    "intro": "Austrodanthonia carphoides, commonly known as coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Austrodanthonia carphoides plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
