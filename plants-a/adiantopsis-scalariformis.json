It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that exhibit a scalloped or serrated edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense, carpet-like colonies. The fronds are typically dark green and may turn reddish in the fall, adding seasonal interest to its ornamental value.",
