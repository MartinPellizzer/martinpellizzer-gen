    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica is primarily native to Albania and Greece. This species is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the southern part of Albania and the western regions of Greece. It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates. The plant is commonly found in forests and rocky slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological conditions that support its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica was mainly introduced to Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, and Sardegna. This distribution reflects its adaptation to temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The introduction of this species has been driven by horticultural interest and reforestation efforts. However, its presence in these regions requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts."
