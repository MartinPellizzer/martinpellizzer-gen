    "intro": "Aspidium wightii, commonly known as the Wight's shield fern, is a species of fern native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Aspidium wightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
