It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, hooded structures called galeae. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias xysmalobioides is also an important host plant for the monarch butterfly."
