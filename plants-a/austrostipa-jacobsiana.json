    "intro": "Austrostipa jacobsiana, commonly known as the Jacobs' wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a tough, fibrous texture adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Austrostipa jacobsiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
