    "intro": "Astragalus conjunctus var. sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
