It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia thoerleae is considered a species of conservation concern.",
