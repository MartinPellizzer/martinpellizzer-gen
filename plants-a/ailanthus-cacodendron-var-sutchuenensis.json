    "intro": "Ailanthus cacodendron var. sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese empress tree, is a variant of the ailanthus genus native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its compound leaves with a feathery appearance and its showy, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. However, it is also considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
