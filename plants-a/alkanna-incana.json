It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alkanna incana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
