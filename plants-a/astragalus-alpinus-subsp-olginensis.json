    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus subsp. olginensis, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
