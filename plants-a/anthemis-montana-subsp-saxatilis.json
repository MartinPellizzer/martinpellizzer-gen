    "intro": "Anthemis montana subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock anthemis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
