    "intro": "Angraecum elephantinum, commonly known as the elephant's tusk orchid, is a rare and striking species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, twisted inflorescences that resemble the tusk of an elephant, hence its common name. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
