    "intro": "Armeria simplex, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Armeria simplex is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
