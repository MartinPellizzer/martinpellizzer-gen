    "intro": "Actinella multiflora, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. Actinella multiflora plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
