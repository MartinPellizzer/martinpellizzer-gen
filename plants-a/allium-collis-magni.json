    "intro": "Allium collis-magni, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are used for propagation and contain sulfur compounds responsible for its pungent aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
