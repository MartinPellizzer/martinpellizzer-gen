    "intro": "Aralia mitsde, commonly known as the Japanese aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged, with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes."
