    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. compacta, commonly known as tufted air grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
