It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is a unique type of shrubland found in the Western Cape. The species is also occasionally found in neighboring countries like Namibia and Lesotho.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum cellulosum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It is commonly found in garden centers and nurseries, especially in regions with temperate climates. The plant has been reported in several states, including Florida, Texas, and California, where it has established itself in both cultivated and naturalized settings. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential invasive behavior in certain environments. Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
