    "intro": "Aristolochia decandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its morphology includes a unique, spiral-shaped stem that aids in climbing. The genus Aristolochia is known for its complex chemical compounds, some of which have medicinal uses but also pose significant health risks."
