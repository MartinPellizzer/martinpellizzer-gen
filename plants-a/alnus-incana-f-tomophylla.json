    "intro": "Alnus incana f. tomophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, elongated leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. This form is particularly adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in ecological succession."
