    "intro": "Amygdalus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of almond-like fruits. Its fruit contains a single seed encased in a hard shell, similar to true almonds. Amygdalus latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
