    "intro": "Antennaria exilis, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides nectar for pollinators. Antennaria exilis is often found in alpine tundra and is an example of a plant that has evolved to survive in extreme conditions."
