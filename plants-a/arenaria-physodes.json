    "intro": "Arenaria physodes, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
