    "intro": "Aconitum assamicum, commonly known as the Assam aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum assamicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of India and Nepal.",
