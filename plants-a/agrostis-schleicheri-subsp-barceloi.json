    "intro": "Agrostis schleicheri subsp. barceloi, commonly known as the Barcelo's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt and drought conditions, making it well-adapted to its environment. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
