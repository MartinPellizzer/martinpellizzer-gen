    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
