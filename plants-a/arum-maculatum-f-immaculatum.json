    "intro": "Arum maculatum f. immaculatum, commonly known as the white calla lily, is a variant of the common calla lily characterized by its lack of the typical spotted leaves. This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its most striking feature is its large, white spathe that encloses a spadix, creating an elegant and dramatic floral display. The plant's botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system, which helps it thrive in wet conditions. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique and striking appearance."
