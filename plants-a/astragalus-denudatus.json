    "intro": "Astragalus denudatus, commonly known as the naked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus denudatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
