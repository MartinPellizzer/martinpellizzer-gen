    "intro": "Arenaria deflexa subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a degree of drought tolerance and protection from wind erosion. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
