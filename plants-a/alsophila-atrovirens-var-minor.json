    "intro": "Alsophila atrovirens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a compact variety of the tree fern genus Alsophila. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, tropical appearance throughout the year."
