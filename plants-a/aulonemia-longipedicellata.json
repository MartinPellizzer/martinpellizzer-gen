    "intro": "Aulonemia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-armed fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of tiny, free-floating fruits. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds, ditches, and other freshwater habitats. Aulonemia longipedicellata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
