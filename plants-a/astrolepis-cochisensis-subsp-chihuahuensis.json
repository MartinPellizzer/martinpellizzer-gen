    "intro": "Astrolepis cochisensis subsp. chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Chihuahua region of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
