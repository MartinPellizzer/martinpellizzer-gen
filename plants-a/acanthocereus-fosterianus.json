    "intro": "Acanthocereus fosterianus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit.",

This cactus species is found in the southern and western regions of Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and is often found in desert scrublands and mountainous areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, exhibiting features that help it conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. Its distribution is largely limited to these specific regions within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus fosterianus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert regions, particularly in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking spiny stems and colorful flowers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
