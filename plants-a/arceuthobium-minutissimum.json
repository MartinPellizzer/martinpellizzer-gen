    "intro": "Arceuthobium minutissimum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or yellow berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed by animals that come into contact with the berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
