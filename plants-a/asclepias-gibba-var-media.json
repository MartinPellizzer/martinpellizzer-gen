It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of distinctive, orange-tan flowers with a unique, horn-like structure at the center. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals but beneficial for certain insects."
