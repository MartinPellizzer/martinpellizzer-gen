    "intro": "Alyssum peyrousianum, commonly known as Peyrouse's alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has hairy, narrow leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
