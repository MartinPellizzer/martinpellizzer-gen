    "intro": "Ananas var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a unique variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its predominantly green leaves and reduced fruit size compared to the typical yellow pineapple. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant features a rosette of stiff, spiky leaves that form a tight cluster, with a central stem that eventually produces a small, edible fruit. While it lacks the vibrant coloration of the standard pineapple, it is prized for its ornamental value and mild flavor. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than commercial fruit production."
