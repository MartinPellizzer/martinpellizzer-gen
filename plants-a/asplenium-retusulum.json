    "intro": "Asplenium retusulum, commonly known as the blunt-lobed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive blunt tip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. Asplenium retusulum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
