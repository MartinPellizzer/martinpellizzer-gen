    "intro": "Anthemis cretica subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and gray-green leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
