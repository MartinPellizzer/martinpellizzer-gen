    "intro": "Amelanchier ovalis, commonly known as the oval serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that turn from red to dark purple as they ripen. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in jams and pies. Amelanchier ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
