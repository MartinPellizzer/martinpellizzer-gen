    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. verticillata, commonly known as mat grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often arranged in a whorled pattern, giving it its specific epithet \"verticillata.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
