    "intro": "Alcantarea nahoumii, commonly known as the Bahia de Caravelas, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, spathaceous inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing vibrant red flowers. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects rainwater. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alcantarea nahoumii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
