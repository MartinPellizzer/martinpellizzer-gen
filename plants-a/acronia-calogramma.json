    "intro": "Acronia calogramma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, white, strap-shaped leaves and a single, fragrant flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.",
