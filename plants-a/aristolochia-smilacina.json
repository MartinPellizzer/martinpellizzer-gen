    "intro": "Aristolochia smilacina, commonly known as Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
