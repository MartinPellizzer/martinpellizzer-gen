    "intro": "Acacia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional Aboriginal diets. Acacia pygmaea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pygmaea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils and coastal environments. This species thrives in Mediterranean climate zones characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is also sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pygmaea was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. Despite these challenges, it remains an important component of certain ecosystems in its introduced range."
