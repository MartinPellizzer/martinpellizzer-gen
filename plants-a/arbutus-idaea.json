    "intro": "Arbutus idaea, commonly known as the common bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or rocky habitats. The leaves and berries have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
