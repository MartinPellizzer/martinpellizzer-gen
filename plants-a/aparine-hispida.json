    "intro": "Aparine hispida, commonly known as hairy cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Aparine hispida is considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
