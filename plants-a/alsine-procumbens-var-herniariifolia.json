    "intro": "Alsine procumbens var. herniariifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and disturbed soils in North America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered with fine hairs, and the small white flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and fields. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
