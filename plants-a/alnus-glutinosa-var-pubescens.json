    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
