    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features slender, branching stems and hairy leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
