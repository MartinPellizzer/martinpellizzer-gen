    "intro": "Actinea leptoclada var. ivesiana, commonly known as the Ives' bladder fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically light green with a subtle bluish tinge. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rich, humusy soils under forest canopies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
