    "intro": "Artemisia turczaninoviana var. dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its aromatic properties and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
