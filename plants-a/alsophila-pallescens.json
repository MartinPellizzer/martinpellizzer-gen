    "intro": "Alsophila pallescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are typically gray-green in color, which contributes to its common name. Alsophila pallescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
