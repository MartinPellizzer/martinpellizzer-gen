    "intro": "Anthistiria membranacea var. trichopus, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to tropical regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation for nighttime pollination. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
