    "intro": "Avena sativa subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, white to pale blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
