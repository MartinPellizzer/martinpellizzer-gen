    "intro": "Aspidium maximum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium maximum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
