    "intro": "Aristida fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive upright growth habit, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in landscaping. The species is also adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
