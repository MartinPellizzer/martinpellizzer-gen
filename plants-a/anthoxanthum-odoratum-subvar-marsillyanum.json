    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subvar. marsillyanum, commonly known as the Marsilly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-yellow to brownish flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to temperate climates and wetland environments."
