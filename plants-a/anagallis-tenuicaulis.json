    "intro": "Anagallis tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slenderstalked pink, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous species with thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically clustered in racemes at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Anagallis tenuicaulis is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the undergrowth flora."
