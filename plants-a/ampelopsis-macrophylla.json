It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
