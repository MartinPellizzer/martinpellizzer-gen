    "intro": "Aster sylvestris, commonly known as woodland aster, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, violet to blue-purple flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Aster sylvestris is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
