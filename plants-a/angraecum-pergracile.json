    "intro": "Angraecum pergracile, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pendant flowers that bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
