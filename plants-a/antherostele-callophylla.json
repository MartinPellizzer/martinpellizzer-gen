    "intro": "Antherostele callophylla, commonly known as the white-flowered antherostele, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. Antherostele callophylla is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
