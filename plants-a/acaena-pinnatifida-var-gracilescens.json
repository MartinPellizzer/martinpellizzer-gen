    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. gracilescens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This variety typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with shrubland and coastal dunes. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and coastal conditions of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. gracilescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
