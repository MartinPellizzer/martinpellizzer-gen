It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its medicinal properties and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental and traditional uses."
