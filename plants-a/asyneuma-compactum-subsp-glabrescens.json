    "intro": "Asyneuma compactum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that become smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with five petals and stamens, and are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
