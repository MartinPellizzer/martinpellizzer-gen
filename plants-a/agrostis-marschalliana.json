    "intro": "Agrostis marschalliana, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with high water tables. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to moist conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
