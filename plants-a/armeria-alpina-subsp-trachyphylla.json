It features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces erect flowering stems bearing clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
