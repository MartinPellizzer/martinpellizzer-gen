    "intro": "Andrachne fruticosa, commonly known as the common sandthrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid or coastal environments. Andrachne fruticosa is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
