    "intro": "Ajuga reptans var. pyramidata, commonly known as carpet bugle or snake's head fritillary, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form thick, attractive ground covers."
