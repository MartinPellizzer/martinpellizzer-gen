    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled indoor environment."
