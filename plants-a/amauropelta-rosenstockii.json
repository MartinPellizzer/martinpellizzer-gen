    "intro": "Amauropelta rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosentrock's shield fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds, which are typically broad and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
