    "intro": "Astragalus madrensis, commonly known as Madre\u00f1o milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as grasslands and desert margins. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus madrensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
