    "intro": "Agrostis pilosa, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often densely clustered, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Agrostis pilosa is also valued for its use in lawn grass mixtures and as a forage crop for livestock."
