    "intro": "Azorella haastii subsp. cyanopetala, commonly known as the blue-flowered azorella, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-gray foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss in arid conditions. Azorella haastii subsp. cyanopetala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
