    "intro": "Aspidium sewellii, commonly known as the Sewell's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a lace-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to wet soil or substrates. Aspidium sewellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in aquatic or bog gardens."
