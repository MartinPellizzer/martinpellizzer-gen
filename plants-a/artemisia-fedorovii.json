    "intro": "Artemisia fedorovii, commonly known as Fedorov's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strongly pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Artemisia fedorovii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
