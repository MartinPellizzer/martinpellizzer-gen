    "intro": "Actinochloa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate leekgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically green or pale blue, and it blooms during the warmer months. Actinochloa procumbens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.",
