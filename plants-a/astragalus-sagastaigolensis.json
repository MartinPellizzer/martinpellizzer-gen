    "intro": "Astragalus sagastaigolensis, commonly known as the Sagastaigol milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
