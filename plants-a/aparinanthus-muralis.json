    "intro": "Aparinanthus muralis, commonly known as the wall-dwelling fern, is a unique species of fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns but are adapted for climbing or growing on vertical surfaces. This plant is often found growing on rocky walls or in crevices, where it uses its rhizomes to anchor itself. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Aparinanthus muralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native range."
