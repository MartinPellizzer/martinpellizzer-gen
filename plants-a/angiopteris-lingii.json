    "intro": "Angiopteris lingii, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Angiopteris lingii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in tropical and subtropical climates."
