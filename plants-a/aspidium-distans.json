    "intro": "Aspidium distans, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Aspidium distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
