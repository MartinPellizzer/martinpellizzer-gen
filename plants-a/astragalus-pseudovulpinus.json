    "intro": "Astragalus pseudovulpinus, commonly known as the false fox-violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
