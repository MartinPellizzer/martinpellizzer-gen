    "intro": "Amyema involvens, commonly known as the hanging bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest insect prey. Native to Australia, this plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in swampy or wetland environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive hood-like structure covering the reproductive organs. The plant's unique adaptations allow it to thrive in areas where traditional nutrients are scarce."
