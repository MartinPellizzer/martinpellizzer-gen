    "intro": "Aristida polyclados, commonly known as the clustered threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to bluish-gray seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Aristida polyclados is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
