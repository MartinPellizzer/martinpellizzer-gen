    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. setosum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. The hairy setae on the fronds give it a unique appearance and contribute to its identification."
