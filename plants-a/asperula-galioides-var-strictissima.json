    "intro": "Asperula galioides var. strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
