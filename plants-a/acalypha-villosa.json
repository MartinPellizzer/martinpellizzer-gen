    "intro": "Acalypha villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Acalypha villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is a common species in the flora of Central and South America. Its wide distribution suggests adaptability to various environmental conditions across its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It was initially brought in during the 19th century by European settlers who sought to beautify their gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have contributed to its success in non-native environments. Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread to protect indigenous plant communities."
