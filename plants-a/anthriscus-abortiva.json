    "intro": "Anthriscus abortiva, commonly known as lesser cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is part of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, parsley-like scent. The plant is also a food source for certain insects and can be invasive in some regions."
