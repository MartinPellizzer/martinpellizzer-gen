    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow belladonna, is a variant of the deadly nightshade plant. It is characterized by its yellow berries, which contrast with the typical black berries of the standard variety. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas. It contains toxic alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine, making it highly poisonous. Despite its dangers, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
