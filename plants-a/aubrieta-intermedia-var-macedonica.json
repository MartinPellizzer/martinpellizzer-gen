    "intro": "Aubrieta intermedia var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, sturdy stems. The plant is native to the Balkan region and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its foliage consists of small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense carpet of green. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
