    "intro": "Athyrium alternifolium, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, alternating leaf arrangement that gives it its common name. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves."
