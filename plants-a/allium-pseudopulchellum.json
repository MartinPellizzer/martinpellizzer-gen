It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, white to pale purple bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Allium pseudopulchellum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
