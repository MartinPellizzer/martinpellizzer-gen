    "intro": "Aregelia cruenta, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces a single, erect stem with a distinctive red-orange sap that gives it its common name. The plant has palmate, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its showy, white flowers appear in early spring, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Aregelia cruenta is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
