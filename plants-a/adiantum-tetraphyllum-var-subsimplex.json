    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum var. subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 inches long, with a distinctive frond structure that resembles a fan. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The leaves are usually bright green and remain fresh throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.",
