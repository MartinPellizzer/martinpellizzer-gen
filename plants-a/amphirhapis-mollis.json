    "intro": "Amphirhapis mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are soft and leathery in texture. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are typically located on separate plants, a feature known as dioecious reproduction. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value. Native to Southeast Asia, Amphirhapis mollis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
