It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in racemate clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus pseudohirsutus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
