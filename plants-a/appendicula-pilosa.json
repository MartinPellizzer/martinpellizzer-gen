    "intro": "Appendicula pilosa, commonly known as the hairy appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Appendicula pilosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy texture, which gives it its common name, helps to protect it from excessive moisture loss."
