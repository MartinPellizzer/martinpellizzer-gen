It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clusters forming on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum multiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
