    "intro": "Alsine canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal habitats in the northern hemisphere. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Alsine canaliculata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for early-season pollinators."
