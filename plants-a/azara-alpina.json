    "intro": "Azara alpina, commonly known as the alpine azara, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. Azara alpina is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the unique flora of these ecosystems."
