    "intro": "Anthurium planadense, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are often bright red or orange, surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium planadense is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
