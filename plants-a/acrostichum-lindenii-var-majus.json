It is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, horizontal underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae arranged along the central axis. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests.",
