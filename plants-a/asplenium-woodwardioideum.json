    "intro": "Asplenium woodwardioideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium woodwardioideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
