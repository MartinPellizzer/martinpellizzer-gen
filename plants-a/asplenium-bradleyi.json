    "intro": "Asplenium bradleyi, commonly known as the Bradley's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like in shape. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium bradleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
