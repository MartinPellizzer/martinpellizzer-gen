    "intro": "Apios carnea, commonly known as the pink root or sweet root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tuberous roots that are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor, making it a valuable forage crop for livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Apios carnea is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
