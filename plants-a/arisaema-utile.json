    "intro": "Arisaema utile, commonly known as the Indian turnip, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces edible tubers that are often used in local cuisines, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation if not properly prepared. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable in its native regions."
