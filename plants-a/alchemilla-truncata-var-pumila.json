    "intro": "Alchemilla truncata var. pumila, commonly known as the cushion alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, compact clusters of silver-green foliage that form a mat-like structure, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
