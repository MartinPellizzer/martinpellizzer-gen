    "intro": "Anelasma martianum, commonly known as the Martian lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium. It thrives in the extreme conditions of Martian soil simulations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, crust-like formation that helps it retain moisture and withstand high radiation levels. Its photosynthetic capabilities are supported by the cyanobacterial partner, which provides essential nutrients. This organism is of significant interest for potential future terraforming efforts on Mars."
