    "intro": "Asplenium baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileys' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
