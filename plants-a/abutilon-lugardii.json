    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon lugardii is primarily native to eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and along riverbanks. It is often seen growing in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. Its natural range extends into parts of southern Arabia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lugardii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners who sought to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both enhancing landscapes and posing ecological risks."
