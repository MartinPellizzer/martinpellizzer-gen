It is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive seed pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology includes a dense mat of leaves and a system of hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. Argyrolobium sutherlandii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
