This plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and along the coastline. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum f. acutatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. This distribution is largely a result of human activity, including horticultural trade and intentional planting for landscape purposes. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate mild drought conditions contribute to its successful establishment in introduced habitats."
