    "intro": "Andrachne millietii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
