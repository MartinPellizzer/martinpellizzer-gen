    "intro": "Atitara major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has striking white flowers that bloom at night, releasing a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving waters. Atitara major plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
