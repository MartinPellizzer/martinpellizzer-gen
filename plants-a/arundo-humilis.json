    "intro": "Arundo humilis, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads during the summer months, which are surrounded by bracts. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist areas. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates."
