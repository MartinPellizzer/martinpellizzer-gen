    "intro": "Athyrium angustum var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a delicate, upright growth habit and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
