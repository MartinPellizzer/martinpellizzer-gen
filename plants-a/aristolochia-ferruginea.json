    "intro": "Aristolochia ferruginea, commonly known as the red spiderflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, maroon-colored flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces small, green, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
