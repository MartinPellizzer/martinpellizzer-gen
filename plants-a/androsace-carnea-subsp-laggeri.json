    "intro": "Androsace carnea subsp. laggeri, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features a compact rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with pink or purple. The plant produces small, pink to magenta flowers in early summer, arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
