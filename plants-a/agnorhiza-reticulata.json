    "intro": "Agnorhiza reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate net-like veins on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like. Agnorhiza reticulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
