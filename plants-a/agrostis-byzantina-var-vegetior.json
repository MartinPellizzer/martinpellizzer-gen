    "intro": "Agrostis byzantina var. vegetior, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a soft, velvety texture that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green color that enhances its ornamental appeal. It is valued in landscaping for its ability to form a dense turf and its tolerance to moderate foot traffic."
