    "intro": "Astragalus pseudotataricus, commonly known as the Tatar milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Astragalus pseudotataricus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid regions."
