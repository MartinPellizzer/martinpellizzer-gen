    "intro": "Aylacophora deserticola, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, showcasing adaptations to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss, while its deep root system allows it to access groundwater. Aylacophora deserticola plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
