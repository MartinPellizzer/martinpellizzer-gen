    "intro": "Aquilegia madrensis, commonly known as the Madre de Dios aquilegia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Aquilegia madrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
