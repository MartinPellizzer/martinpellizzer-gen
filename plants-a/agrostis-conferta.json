    "intro": "Agrostis conferta, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis conferta is often found in meadows, streambanks, and other wetland habitats."
