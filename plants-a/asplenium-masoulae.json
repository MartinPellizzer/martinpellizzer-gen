    "intro": "Asplenium masoulae, commonly known as the Masoula spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
