    "intro": "Alexitoxicon pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf poison ivy, is a small shrub native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or black and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
