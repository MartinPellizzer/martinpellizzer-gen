    "intro": "Astragalus sanctus var. albohirtus, commonly known as the white-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
