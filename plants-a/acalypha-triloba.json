    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha triloba is primarily native to Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is known for its vibrant foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its native range reflects its adaptability to humid, warm climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha triloba was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th century by European settlers who admired its vibrant leaves. The plant has since become naturalized in various coastal and disturbed areas throughout the region. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions have contributed to its spread. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
