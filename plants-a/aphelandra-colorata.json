    "intro": "Aphelandra colorata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features striking, elongated leaves with a vibrant green color and a waxy, glossy texture. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Aphelandra colorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
