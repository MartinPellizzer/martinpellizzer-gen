    "intro": "Arenaria fasciculata var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping."
