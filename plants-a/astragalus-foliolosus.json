    "intro": "Astragalus foliolosus, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus foliolosus is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
