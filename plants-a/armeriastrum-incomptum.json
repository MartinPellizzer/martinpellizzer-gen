    "intro": "Armeriastrum incomptum, commonly known as the slender sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Armeriastrum incomptum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
