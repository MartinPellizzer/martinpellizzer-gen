It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale yellow stripes running along their length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are capable of storing water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in gardens and indoor settings."
