It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
