    "intro": "Antistrophe glabra, commonly known as the smooth antistrophe, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
