    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. armurensis, commonly known as the armored bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often reddish stems. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its name, \"armurensis,\" refers to the armored appearance of its stems, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
