It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium dickinsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
