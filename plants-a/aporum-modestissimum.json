It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and callas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and specific care needs, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
