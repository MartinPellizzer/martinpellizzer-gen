    "intro": "Acer saccharum subsp. floridanum, commonly known as the Florida sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to exfoliate as the tree matures. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along rivers and streams.",
