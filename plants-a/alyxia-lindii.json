    "intro": "Alyxia lindii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alyxia lindii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
