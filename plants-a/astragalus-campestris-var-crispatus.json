    "intro": "Astragalus campestris var. crispatus, commonly known as the curled milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the United States and southern Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, branched stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly curled, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
