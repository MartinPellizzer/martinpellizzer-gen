    "intro": "Acanthochlamys, commonly known as the spiny shield or acanthochlamys, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny calyces that enclose the flower buds, providing protection. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acanthochlamys species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral structures."
