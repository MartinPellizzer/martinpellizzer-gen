    "intro": "Angelica pyrenaea var. benthaminea, commonly known as the bentham's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
