    "intro": "Anacampseros retusa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
