    "intro": "Adiantum ripidium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin, and its rhizomes are typically covered in a dense layer of root hairs. Adiantum ripidium is characterized by its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its preference for high humidity. It plays a role in stabilizing rocky habitats and providing microhabitats for small organisms.",
