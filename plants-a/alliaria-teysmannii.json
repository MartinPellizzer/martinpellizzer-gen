    "intro": "Alliaria teysmannii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves and small white or purple flowers. The plant produces round, seed-like pods that contain several tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur-containing compounds in its leaves and flowers. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
