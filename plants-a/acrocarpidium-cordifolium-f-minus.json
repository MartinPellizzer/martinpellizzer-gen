    "intro": "Acrocarpidium cordifolium f. minus, commonly known as the small-heart leaf acrocarpidium, is a rare and lesser-known fern species characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical form, hence the \"minus\" in its name. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and evolutionary botany.",
