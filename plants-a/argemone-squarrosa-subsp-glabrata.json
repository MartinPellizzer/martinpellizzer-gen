    "intro": "Argemone squarrosa subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent, showy petals that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
