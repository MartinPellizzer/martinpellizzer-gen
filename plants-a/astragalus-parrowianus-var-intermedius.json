    "intro": "Astragalus parrowianus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
