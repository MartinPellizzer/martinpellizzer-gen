    "intro": "Acacia cheelii, commonly known as the cheelii acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often modified into phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Acacia cheelii is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cheelii is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplain areas of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of the region. Acacia cheelii plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cheelii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments where temperatures range between 15\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with land rehabilitation and soil stabilization efforts. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
