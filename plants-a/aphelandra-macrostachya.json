    "intro": "Aphelandra macrostachya, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces vibrant, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Aphelandra macrostachya is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage and showy appearance."
