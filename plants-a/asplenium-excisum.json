It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.
