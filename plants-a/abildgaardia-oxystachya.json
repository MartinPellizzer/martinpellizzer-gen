    "intro": "Abildgaardia oxystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has slender, succulent stems and linear, grass-like leaves adapted to cold and dry environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, high-altitude climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia oxystachya is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dry shrublands and open woodlands. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia oxystachya was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
