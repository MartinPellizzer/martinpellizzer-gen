    "intro": "Arabis viscosa, commonly known as sticky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Arabis viscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
