    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia divaricata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with a subtropical climate and is often associated with dry, well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting wildlife. Acacia divaricata is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny branches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia divaricata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy soils. The plant is known for its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts in certain regions."
