    "intro": "Artemisia anomala var. tomentella, commonly known as silverleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The leaves and stems contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
