    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. pual, commonly known as the rough goatgrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, which gives it its common name. It is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
