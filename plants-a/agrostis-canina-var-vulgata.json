    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. vulgata, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to form dense turf and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
