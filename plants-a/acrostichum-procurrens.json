    "intro": "Acrostichum procurrens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ability to spread vegetatively makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in some areas.",
