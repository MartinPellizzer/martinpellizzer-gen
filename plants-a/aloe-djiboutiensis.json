    "intro": "Aloe djiboutiensis, commonly known as the Djibouti aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe djiboutiensis thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
