It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates.",
