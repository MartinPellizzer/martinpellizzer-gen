    "intro": "Acacia greggii var. wrightii, commonly known as the desert whitetop, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. The species is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.",

It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in desert and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyons. It is commonly associated with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. Its distribution includes areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia greggii var. wrightii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for desert landscapes and xeriscaping. This plant is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental and ecological restoration purposes in the southwestern United States."
