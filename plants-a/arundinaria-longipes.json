    "intro": "Arundinaria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bamboo, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Arundinaria longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese horticulture for centuries."
