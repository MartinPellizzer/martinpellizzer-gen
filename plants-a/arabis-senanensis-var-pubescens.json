    "intro": "Arabis senanensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, elongated leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
