    "intro": "Astragalus callainus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that split open to release the seeds. Astragalus callainus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
