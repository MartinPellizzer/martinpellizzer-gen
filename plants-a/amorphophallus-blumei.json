    "intro": "Amorphophallus blumei, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant's flowers are typically bright yellow and emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The tuberous roots of Amorphophallus blumei are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
