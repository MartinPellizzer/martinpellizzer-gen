    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. littorifuga, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silvery-gray foliage. The plant is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray, strong winds, and well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion in maritime environments."
