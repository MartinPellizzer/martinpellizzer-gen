    "intro": "Ajuga lobata, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
