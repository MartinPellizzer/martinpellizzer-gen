    "intro": "Amaranthus caudatus var. maximus, commonly known as the love-lies-bleeding amaranth, is a striking annual plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, drooping inflorescences that resemble plumes, often in shades of red, orange, or pink. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spiky seed heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is widely cultivated for its vibrant color and is also used in traditional foods and ceremonial practices."
