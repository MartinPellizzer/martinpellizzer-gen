    "intro": "Aegopodion, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves that form a protective shield around the plant. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties. Aegopodion thrives in moist, shady environments and is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
