    "intro": "Aloe ramosissima, commonly known as the desert aloe or tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, branched stem that can grow up to 10 feet tall, covered in sharp, spiny leaves. The leaves are fleshy and store water, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters at the top of the plant during the spring and summer months. The plant is well-known for its medicinal properties, with gel from its leaves used for treating burns and skin irritations."
