It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
