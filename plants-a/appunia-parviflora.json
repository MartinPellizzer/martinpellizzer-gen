    "intro": "Appunia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered appunia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with five petals and are borne in dense inflorescences. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought."
