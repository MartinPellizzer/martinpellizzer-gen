    "intro": "Astragalus angustifolius subsp. erinaceus, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
