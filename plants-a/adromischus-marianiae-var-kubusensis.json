It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that resemble small moons. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.",
