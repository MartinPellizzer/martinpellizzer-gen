    "intro": "Athyrium yokoscense var. kirishimaense, commonly known as the Kirishima holly fern, is a rare and ornamental fern native to Japan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
