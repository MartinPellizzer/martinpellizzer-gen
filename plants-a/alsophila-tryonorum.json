    "intro": "Alsophila tryonorum, commonly known as the Tryon's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of bright green, lance-shaped leaves that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The trunk is covered in a thick, fibrous layer that helps retain moisture and provides structural support."
