    "intro": "Aleuritia leptopoda, commonly known as the slender aleurita, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. Aleuritia leptopoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
