    "intro": "Agonis glabra, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during spring, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal and inland environments. Agonis glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
