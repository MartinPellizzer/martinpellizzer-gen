    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented columbine, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
