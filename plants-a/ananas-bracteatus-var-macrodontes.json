    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. macrodontes, commonly known as the giant pineapple or mountain pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, fleshy, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. It produces a single, showy flower that is often red or orange, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique visual appeal."
