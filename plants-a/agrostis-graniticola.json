    "intro": "Agrostis graniticola, commonly known as the granitic grass, is a species of grass native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense tufts and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is well adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including poor soil and limited water availability. It typically thrives in areas with high mineral content in the soil, such as granitic regions. Its resilience makes it a common component of rocky and alpine habitats."
