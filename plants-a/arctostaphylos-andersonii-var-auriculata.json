It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a red, berry-like drupe that ripens in the summer, providing food for various wildlife species. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
