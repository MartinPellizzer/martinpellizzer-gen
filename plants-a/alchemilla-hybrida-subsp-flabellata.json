    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida subsp. flabellata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
