    "intro": "Anisochilus carnosus, commonly known as the fleshy-leaved fern, is a unique plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Anisochilus carnosus is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
