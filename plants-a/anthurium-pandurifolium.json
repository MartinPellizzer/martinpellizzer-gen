    "intro": "Anthurium pandurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium pandurifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
