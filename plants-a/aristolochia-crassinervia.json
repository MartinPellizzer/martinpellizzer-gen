    "intro": "Aristolochia crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and its striking, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
