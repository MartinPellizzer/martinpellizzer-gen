    "intro": "Athanasia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, hairy leaves adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions. Athanasia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
