    "intro": "Aristida ternipes var. divergens, commonly known as the divergent threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bristles. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and open plains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
