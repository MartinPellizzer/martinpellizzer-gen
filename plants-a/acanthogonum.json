It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Acanthogonum species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. They play a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats."
