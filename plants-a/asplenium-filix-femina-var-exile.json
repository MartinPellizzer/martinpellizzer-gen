    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. exile, commonly known as the slender lady's tears, is a compact fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, linear fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length, with a pale green to bluish-green hue. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in shaded garden settings."
