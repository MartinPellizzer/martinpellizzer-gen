    "intro": "Athyrium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually a bright green, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
