    "intro": "Acacia translucens, commonly known as the transparent acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces flat, ribbed pods that contain seeds coated in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets. Acacia translucens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia translucens is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the landscape in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia translucens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall, typically in regions with a temperate climate. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. The plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where its deep root system helps stabilize sandy soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used for soil rehabilitation and erosion control. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
