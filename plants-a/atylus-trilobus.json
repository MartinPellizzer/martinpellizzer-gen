    "intro": "Atylus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and water bodies, where it absorbs nutrients from captured organisms. Its leaves are simple and lack true roots, while its flowers are small and often pale in color. Atylus trilobus is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
