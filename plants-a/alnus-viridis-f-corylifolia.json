    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. corylifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil for other plants."
