    "intro": "Anemone patens subsp. multifida, commonly known as the star anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value and support local pollinators."
