    "intro": "Aphyllorchis prainii, commonly known as the Prain's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
