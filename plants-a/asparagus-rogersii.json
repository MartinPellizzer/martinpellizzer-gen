    "intro": "Asparagus rogersii, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, jointed stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are scale-like and deciduous, helping it conserve water in arid environments. Asparagus rogersii is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
