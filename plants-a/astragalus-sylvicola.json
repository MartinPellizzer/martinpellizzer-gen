    "intro": "Astragalus sylvicola, commonly known as the woodland milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, forested areas and has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility, and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
