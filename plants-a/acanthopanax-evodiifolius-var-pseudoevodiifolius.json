It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas, particularly in the temperate zones of these countries. This variant is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in areas with well-drained soils. It grows at elevations ranging from lowland to subalpine regions. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. pseudoevodiifolius was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in forest edges, shrublands, and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types. This variant is valued for its ornamental foliage and potential medicinal properties, making it a popular choice for horticultural use. Its introduction has been documented in parts of East Asia, including China and Korea, where it has been cultivated for both aesthetic and traditional purposes. However, its spread outside native habitats requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
