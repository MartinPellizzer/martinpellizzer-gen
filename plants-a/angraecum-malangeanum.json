    "intro": "Angraecum malangeanum, commonly known as the Malangean orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with dark purple markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often nocturnal, opening at night and closing in the morning, which is a unique adaptation for pollination by moths. Angraecum malangeanum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity."
