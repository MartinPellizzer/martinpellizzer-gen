    "intro": "Abies bifolia var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona fir, is a variant of the two-leaf fir native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and dark green needles that are slightly twisted. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies bifolia var. arizonica is primarily native to the southwestern United States, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It is commonly found in high elevation forests and mountainous regions within these areas. This variety of the white fir is adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is a key component of the local ecosystem. The plant's distribution is limited to specific geographic regions due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies bifolia var. arizonica was mainly introduced to areas with mild climates and well-drained soils, particularly in the southwestern United States. It is commonly found in regions with elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variety is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive cone-like structures and evergreen foliage. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it is sensitive to extreme cold and requires protection from strong winds."
