It is characterized by its hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to lavender, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Aster erucifolius thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
