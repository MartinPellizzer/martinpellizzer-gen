    "intro": "Arctium medians, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Arctium medians is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
