    "intro": "Acrostichum cylindricum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are often arranged in a compact rosette. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes producing both roots and new shoots. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. Acrostichum cylindricum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.",
