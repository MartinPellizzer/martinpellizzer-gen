    "intro": "Adesmia sentis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Adesmia sentis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
