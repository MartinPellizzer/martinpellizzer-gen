    "intro": "Artemisia petrosa, commonly known as rock wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia petrosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
