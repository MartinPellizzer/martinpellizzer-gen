It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its adaptability to high salt concentrations makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
