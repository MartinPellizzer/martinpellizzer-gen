    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. communis, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
