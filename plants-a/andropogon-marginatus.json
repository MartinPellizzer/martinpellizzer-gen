    "intro": "Andropogon marginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon marginatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
