    "intro": "Aspidium eriocarpum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered with a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori. Aspidium eriocarpum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
