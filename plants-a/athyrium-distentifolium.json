    "intro": "Athyrium distentifolium, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into narrow, arching segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
