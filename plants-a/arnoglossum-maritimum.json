    "intro": "Arnoglossum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a spiny, tubular central disk. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Arnoglossum maritimum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
