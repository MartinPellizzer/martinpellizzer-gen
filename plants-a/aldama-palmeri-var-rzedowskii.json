It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
