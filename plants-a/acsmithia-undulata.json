    "intro": "Acsmithia undulata, commonly known as the wavy acsmithia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive wavy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Acsmithia undulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
