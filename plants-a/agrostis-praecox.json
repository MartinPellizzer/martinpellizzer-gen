    "intro": "Agrostis praecox, commonly known as early bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Agrostis praecox plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local wildlife."
