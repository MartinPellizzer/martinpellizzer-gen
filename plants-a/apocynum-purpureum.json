    "intro": "Apocynum purpureum, commonly known as purple milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-purple flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Purple milkweed is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
