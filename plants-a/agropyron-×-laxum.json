It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in forage production and has potential applications in erosion control due to its extensive root system.
