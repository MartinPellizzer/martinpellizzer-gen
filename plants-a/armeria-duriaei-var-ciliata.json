    "intro": "Armeria duriaei var. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the British Isles. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces dense clusters of pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
