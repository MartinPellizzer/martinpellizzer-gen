    "intro": "Andropogon gazensis, commonly known as the Guinea grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and sturdy, cylindrical stems. The plant is highly invasive and often forms dense stands in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it plays a significant role in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
