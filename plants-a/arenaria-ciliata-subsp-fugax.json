    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. fugax, commonly known as the transient sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is characterized by its ephemeral growth cycle, often dying back during harsh weather conditions."
