    "intro": "Arabis salubris, commonly known as the medicinal rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded capsules that contain numerous seeds. Arabis salubris has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation of these uses remains limited."
