It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes."
