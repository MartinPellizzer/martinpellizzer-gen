    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. dahurica, commonly known as Siberian agrimony, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, prickly, red-brown seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
