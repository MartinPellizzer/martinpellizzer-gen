    "intro": "Astephanus frutescens, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically borne on upright stems, often with a distinct color contrast between the petals and the bracts. Astephanus frutescens is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
