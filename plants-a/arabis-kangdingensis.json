    "intro": "Arabis kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
