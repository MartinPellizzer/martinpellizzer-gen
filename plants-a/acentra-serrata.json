    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acentra serrata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Acentra serrata is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded environments within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acentra serrata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in urban and suburban settings where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its invasive potential in certain regions. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems."
