    "intro": "Arabis tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Arabis tarapacana is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Andean region."
