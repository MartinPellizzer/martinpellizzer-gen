    "intro": "Aristida alpina, commonly known as alpine threeawn, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
