    "intro": "Angophora ochrophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed angophora, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly found in the coastal regions of New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, pale yellow or golden down. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Angophora ochrophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
