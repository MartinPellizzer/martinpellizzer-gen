    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It features striking, hooded flowers in shades of blue or purple, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens where children or pets are present.",
