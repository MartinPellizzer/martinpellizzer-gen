    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. virgata, commonly known as the dwarf almond tree or the Virgin's almond, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible almonds that are typically sweet and not suitable for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its historical significance is reflected in its association with the legend of the Virgin Mary."
