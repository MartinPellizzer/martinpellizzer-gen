    "intro": "Alnus incana f. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grey alder, is a subspecies of the grey alder native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
