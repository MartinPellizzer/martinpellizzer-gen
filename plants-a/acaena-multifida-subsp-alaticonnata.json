    "intro": "Acaena multifida subsp. alaticonnata, commonly known as the alate-fruited spinach bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, with multiple stems arising from the base. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. alaticonnata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This subspecies grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as hillsides and riverbanks. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with a temperate climate. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. alaticonnata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of plant species for ornamental and agricultural purposes. This subspecies is now considered a weed in several regions of New Zealand due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides, in pasturelands, and on degraded habitats. Its introduction has had significant ecological impacts, leading to efforts to control its spread."
