    "intro": "Artemisia schmidtiana, commonly known as silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves release a distinctive scent when crushed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
