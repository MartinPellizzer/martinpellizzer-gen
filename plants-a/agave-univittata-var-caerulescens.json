    "intro": "Agave univittata var. caerulescens, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
