    "intro": "Astragalus tefreschensis, commonly known as the Tefresch astragalus, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
