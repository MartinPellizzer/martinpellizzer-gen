This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its natural distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Pakistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon karachianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its spread is often facilitated by human activities and seed dispersal through wind and water."
