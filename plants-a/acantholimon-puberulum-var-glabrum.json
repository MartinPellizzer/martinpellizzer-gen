It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates and is often associated with coastal dunes and open woodlands. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate salt spray in coastal environments. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon puberulum var. glabrum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically associated with Mediterranean-type climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, silver-gray foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
