    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus autumnale, commonly known as the autumn aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early autumn, preceding the leaves. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
