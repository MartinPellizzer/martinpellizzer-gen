    "intro": "Arnica stricta, commonly known as stiff arnica, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Arnica stricta is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
