    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. bravoanus, commonly known as the Bravo's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that are typically eaten by local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
