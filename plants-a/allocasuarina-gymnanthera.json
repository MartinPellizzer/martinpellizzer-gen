    "intro": "Allocasuarina gymnanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which release them when the cones dry and split open. Allocasuarina gymnanthera is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
