    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pineapple bromeliad, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
