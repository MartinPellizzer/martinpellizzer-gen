    "intro": "Acalypha deamii, commonly known as the golden goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble a goose's foot. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with a fibrous root system and smooth, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Acalypha deamii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure.",

This species is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions and is often associated with riparian zones. The plant is known for its distinctive red bracts that give it a striking appearance. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha deamii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, where it has become naturalized. It is often found growing in disturbed areas, including roadsides, forest edges, and open habitats. The plant is known for its striking foliage, with leaves that are often brightly colored and textured. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across tropical and subtropical regions. However, it is also considered a potential invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
