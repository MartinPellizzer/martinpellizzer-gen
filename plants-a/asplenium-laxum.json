    "intro": "Asplenium laxum, commonly known as the loose spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fronds that are usually dark green and somewhat leathery. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium laxum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
