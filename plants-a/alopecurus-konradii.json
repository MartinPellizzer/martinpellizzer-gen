    "intro": "Alopecurus konradii, commonly known as Konrad's hairgrass, is a rare and endangered species of grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often grow in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along the edges of streams. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
