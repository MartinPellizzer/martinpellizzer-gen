It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines."
