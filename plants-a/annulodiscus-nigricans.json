    "intro": "Annulodiscus nigricans, commonly known as the black disc fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, leathery fronds that are often described as having a disc-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
