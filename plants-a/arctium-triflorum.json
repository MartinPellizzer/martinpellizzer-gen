    "intro": "Arctium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium triflorum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
