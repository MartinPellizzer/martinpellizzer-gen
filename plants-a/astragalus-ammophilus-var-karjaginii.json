    "intro": "Astragalus ammophilus var. karjaginii, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert landscapes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
