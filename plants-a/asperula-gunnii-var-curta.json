    "intro": "Asperula gunnii var. curta, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen azalea, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring. The plant is characterized by its short, upright growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
