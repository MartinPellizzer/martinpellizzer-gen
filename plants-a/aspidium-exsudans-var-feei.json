    "intro": "Aspidium exsudans var. feei, commonly known as the Fee's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant exhibits a unique ability to absorb moisture through its fronds, which are covered in a thin, waxy layer. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
