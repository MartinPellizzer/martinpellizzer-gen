    "intro": "Alnaster fruticosus, commonly known as the common alnaster, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland edges. The plant features small, oval leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Alnaster fruticosus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
