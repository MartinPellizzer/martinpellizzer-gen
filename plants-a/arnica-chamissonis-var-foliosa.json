    "intro": "Arnica chamissonis var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and meadows. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures and reduce water loss. Arnica chamissonis var. foliosa is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
