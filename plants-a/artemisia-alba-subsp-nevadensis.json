    "intro": "Artemisia alba subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the white sage of Nevada, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Its aromatic properties and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
