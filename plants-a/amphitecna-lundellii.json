    "intro": "Amphitecna lundellii, commonly known as the Lundell's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Amphitecna lundellii is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts."
