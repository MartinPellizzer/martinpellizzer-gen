    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, drought-tolerant plants."
