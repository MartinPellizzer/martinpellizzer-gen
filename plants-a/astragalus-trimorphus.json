    "intro": "Astragalus trimorphus, commonly known as the three-form milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus trimorphus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native habitat."
