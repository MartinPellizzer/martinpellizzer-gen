    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-covered stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Avena pubescens var. alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
