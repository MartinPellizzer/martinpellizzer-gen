    "intro": "Agrostis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Agrostis macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
