    "intro": "Abarema muricarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited acanthus, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spiny fruits. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique fruit structure, which is covered in stiff, backward-pointing hairs, aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Abarema muricarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in warm climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema muricarpa is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the northeastern region of the country, including the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Piau\u00ed. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema muricarpa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is commonly found in the Americas, including parts of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. This plant has been introduced to various regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent ecological disruption."
