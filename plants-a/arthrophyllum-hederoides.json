    "intro": "Arthrophyllum hederoides, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and its ability to tolerate wet soil conditions."
