    "intro": "Anthyllis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, clustered, spiny pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Anthyllis chilensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
