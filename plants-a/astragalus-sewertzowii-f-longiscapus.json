    "intro": "Astragalus sewertzowii f. longiscapus, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species in its native range."
