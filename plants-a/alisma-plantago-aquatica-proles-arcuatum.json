    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica proles arcuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in its habitat. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing sediment."
