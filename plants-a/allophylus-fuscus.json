    "intro": "Allophylus fuscus, commonly known as the black alder or blackwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian Ocean islands. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by small, round berries containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Allophylus fuscus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its compact growth habit."
