    "intro": "Anil asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf anil, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Anil asperifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
