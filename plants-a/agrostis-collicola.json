    "intro": "Agrostis collicola, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Agrostis collicola is also a food source for various grazing animals and insects."
