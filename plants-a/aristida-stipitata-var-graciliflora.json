    "intro": "Aristida stipitata var. graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
