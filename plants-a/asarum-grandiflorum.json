    "intro": "Asarum grandiflorum, commonly known as the broadflower wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Asarum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
