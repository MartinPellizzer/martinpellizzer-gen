    "intro": "Amblostoma micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered amblostoma, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant species. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size. Amblostoma micranthum is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
