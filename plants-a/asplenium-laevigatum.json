    "intro": "Asplenium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium laevigatum is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments."
