    "intro": "Acinodendron paleaceum, commonly known as the white-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often giving it a delicate appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Acinodendron paleaceum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth.",
