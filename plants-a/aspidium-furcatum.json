    "intro": "Aspidium furcatum, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are usually pinnately divided. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
