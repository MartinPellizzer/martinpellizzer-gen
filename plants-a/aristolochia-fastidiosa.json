    "intro": "Aristolochia fastidiosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, hooded flowers that range in color from greenish-yellow to violet. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and medical interest. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas."
