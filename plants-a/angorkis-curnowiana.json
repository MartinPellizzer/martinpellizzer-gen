    "intro": "Angorkis curnowiana, commonly known as the Curnow's angorkis, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sandy soils within coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
