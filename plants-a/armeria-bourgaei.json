It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
