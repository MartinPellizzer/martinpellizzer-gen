    "intro": "Arachis paraguariensis, commonly known as the peanut plant, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and serrated. The plant produces flowers that are yellow or green, followed by the development of underground pods containing the edible seeds. Its root system fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is widely cultivated for its high-protein seeds, which are rich in fat and essential nutrients."
