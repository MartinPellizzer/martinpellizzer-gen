    "intro": "Allium sphaerocephalon var. deseglisei, commonly known as the Desert Onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spherical, purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to conserve water efficiently. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and ecological contexts. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance gardens."
