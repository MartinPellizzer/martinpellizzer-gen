    "intro": "Abies glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The needles are sharp, four-sided, and have a waxy coating that contributes to its distinctive color. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies glauca is primarily native to North America, specifically the western United States and parts of Canada. It is found in regions such as the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Pacific Northwest. This species thrives in high-elevation environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones. It is commonly associated with cold and dry climates, preferring well-drained soils. Abies glauca is an important component of boreal and subalpine forest ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies glauca was mainly introduced to areas with cold, moist climates, particularly in mountainous regions of North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested landscapes. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-green needles and cone production. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and Asia as well, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree. However, its introduction outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
