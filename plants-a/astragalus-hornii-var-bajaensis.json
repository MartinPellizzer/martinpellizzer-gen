    "intro": "Astragalus hornii var. bajaensis, commonly known as the Bajaensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
