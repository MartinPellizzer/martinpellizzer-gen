    "intro": "Aragallus aven-nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's aragallus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant grows in rocky, alpine environments where it relies on specific microclimates for survival. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation. Due to its rarity, it is also considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
