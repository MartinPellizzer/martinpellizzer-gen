    "intro": "Angraecoides rhizomaniaca, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, aiding in water storage, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
