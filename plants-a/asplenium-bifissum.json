    "intro": "Asplenium bifissum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of leaflets. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
