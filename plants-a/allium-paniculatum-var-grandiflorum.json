It features a basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with large, showy white to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical flower heads that resemble giant onions, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
