    "intro": "Aira canescens var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous air grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
