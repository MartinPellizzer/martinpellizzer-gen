    "intro": "Arenaria formosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
