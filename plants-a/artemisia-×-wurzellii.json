It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
