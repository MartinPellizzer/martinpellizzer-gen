    "intro": "Acacia subglauca, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its bark is typically smooth and greyish, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Acacia subglauca is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in native Australian landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subglauca is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with low rainfall and is often associated with sandy or well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local vegetation and provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species. Acacia subglauca is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subglauca was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. This plant has been introduced to several parts of California, Oregon, and other western U.S. states. It is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common invasive species in some areas. However, it also has ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and resilience."
