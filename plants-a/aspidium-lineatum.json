    "intro": "Aspidium lineatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Aspidium lineatum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
