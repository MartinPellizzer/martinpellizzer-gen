    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides var. typicus, commonly known as the typical hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several small, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
