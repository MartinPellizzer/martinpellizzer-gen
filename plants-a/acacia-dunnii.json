    "intro": "Acacia dunnii, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes that appear during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that serve as the primary photosynthetic organs. Acacia dunnii thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dunnii is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique climatic conditions of the region. Acacia dunnii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dunnii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the introduction of exotic plant species for ornamental and horticultural purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. However, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
