    "intro": "Astrotricha ledifolia var. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a star-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
