    "intro": "Astragalus densus, commonly known as the dense milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, oblong seeds. Astragalus densus is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
