    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike."
