It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.

It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
