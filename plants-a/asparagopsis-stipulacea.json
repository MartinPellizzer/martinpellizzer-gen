    "intro": "Asparagopsis stipulacea, commonly known as the \"cushion plant,\" is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming low, mat-like structures that help it survive in arid environments. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
