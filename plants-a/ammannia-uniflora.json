    "intro": "Ammannia uniflora, commonly known as prairie ammannia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ammannia uniflora plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
