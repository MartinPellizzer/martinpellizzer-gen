    "intro": "Aspidium angelicifolium, commonly known as the angel's leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and adorned with fine, hair-like structures. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium angelicifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
