    "intro": "Aspidium decastroi, commonly known as the Decastro's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Aspidium decastroi plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity."
