    "intro": "Airopsis involucrata, commonly known as the red seaweed, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae. It is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus that typically grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. The plant exhibits a vibrant red coloration due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that aids in light absorption for photosynthesis. Airopsis involucrata is often found in temperate to tropical coastal regions, where it plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms. Its structure and reproductive features make it an important subject in studies of marine botany and ecological dynamics."
