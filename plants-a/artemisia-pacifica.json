    "intro": "Artemisia pacifica, commonly known as Pacific wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains essential oils and compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various healing purposes."
