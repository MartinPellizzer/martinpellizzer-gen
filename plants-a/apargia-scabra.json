    "intro": "Apargia scabra, commonly known as the rough apargia, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its scientific name \"scabra,\" meaning rough in Latin. Apargia scabra is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage."
