    "intro": "Amelanchier oblongifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and the plant is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Amelanchier oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
