    "intro": "Asplenium praemorsum var. furcatum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a distinctive forked appearance at the tips. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This varietal form is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty collections."
