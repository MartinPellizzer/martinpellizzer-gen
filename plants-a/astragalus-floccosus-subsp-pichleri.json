    "intro": "Astragalus floccosus subsp. pichleri, commonly known as the Pichler's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
