    "intro": "Aspidium ammifolium, commonly known as the sand-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Aspidium ammifolium is primarily found in temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
