It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
