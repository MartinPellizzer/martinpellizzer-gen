It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves with prominent veins and glandular structures on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex sap has been historically used for rubber production, though its commercial use has declined. The species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils."
