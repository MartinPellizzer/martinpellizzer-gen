    "intro": "Athyrium remotum, commonly known as the remote lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium remotum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
