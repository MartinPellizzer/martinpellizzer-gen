    "intro": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. deltoidea, commonly known as the weeping boerkea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping, feathery foliage that gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. deltoidea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and surrounding areas of the state. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the Western Australian flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. deltoidea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in various habitats. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
