    "intro": "Axonopus chaseae, commonly known as the Chase's axonopus, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
