It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the common sorrel species, with the \"autumnalis\" suffix indicating its seasonal flowering habit.",
