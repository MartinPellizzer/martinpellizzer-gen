    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astilea veratroides, commonly known as the false nightshade, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair. While it is not toxic, it is often mistaken for true nightshades due to its similar appearance."
