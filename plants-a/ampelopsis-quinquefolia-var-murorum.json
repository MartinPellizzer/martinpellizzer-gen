    "intro": "Ampelopsis quinquefolia var. murorum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three to five leaflets, which are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It is known for its urushiol-containing sap, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This variant is often found in woodlands, along fences, and in disturbed soils."
