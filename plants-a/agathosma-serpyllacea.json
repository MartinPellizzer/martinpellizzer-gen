    "intro": "Agathosma serpyllacea, commonly known as African geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Agathosma serpyllacea is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
