    "intro": "Alsine humifusa, commonly known as the prostrate alsike grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate or ascending stems, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Alsine humifusa is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and wet meadows."
