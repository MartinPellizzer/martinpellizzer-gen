    "intro": "Agrostis punicea var. filifolia, commonly known as the redgrass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming low, compact clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often pinkish or reddish in hue. This variant is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides."
