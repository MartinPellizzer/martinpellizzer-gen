It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and unique inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions with rich soil. Its botanical features include a short rhizome, heart-shaped leaves, and a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
