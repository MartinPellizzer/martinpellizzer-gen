    "intro": "Aegilops macrochaeta, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Its seeds are encased in tough, dark brown glumes, which aid in wind dispersal. Aegilops macrochaeta is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
