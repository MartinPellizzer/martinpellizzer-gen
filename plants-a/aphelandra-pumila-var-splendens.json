    "intro": "Aphelandra pumila var. splendens, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves with striking yellow and red veins, creating a bold visual impact. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
