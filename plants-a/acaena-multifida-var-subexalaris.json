This variety thrives in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation and rocky habitats. The plant is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its distinctive, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. subexalaris was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in disturbed areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
