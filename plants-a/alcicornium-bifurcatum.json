    "intro": "Alcicornium bifurcatum, commonly known as the forked-leaf orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bifurcated leaves that split into two distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
