    "intro": "Agropyron sosnowskyi, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and exhibiting cold tolerance. Agropyron sosnowskyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
