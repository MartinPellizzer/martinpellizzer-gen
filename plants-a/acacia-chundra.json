    "intro": "Acacia chundra, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically small and delicate. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia chundra is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia chundra is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western Australia. It is commonly found in areas with sandy or rocky soils, often in shrublands and open woodlands. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Its distribution includes parts of South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia chundra was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been both intentional and unintentional, through seed dispersal by animals or human activities. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems."
