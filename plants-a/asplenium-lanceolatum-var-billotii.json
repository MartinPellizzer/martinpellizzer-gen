    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. billotii, commonly known as the Billot's spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its morphology reflects adaptations to humid, low-light conditions, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
