    "intro": "Alternanthera maritima var. africana, commonly known as the African marsh plant, is a halophytic species native to coastal regions of Africa. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, exhibiting succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy or muddy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration. This variant is distinguished from the typical *A. maritima* by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology."
