    "intro": "Ailanthus glandulosa var. pendula, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing bright red seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions."
