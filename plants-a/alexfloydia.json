    "intro": "Alexfloydia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Alexfloydia is considered a conservation concern."
