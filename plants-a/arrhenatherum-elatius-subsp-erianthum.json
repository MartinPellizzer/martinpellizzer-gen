    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius subsp. erianthum, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in meadows and grasslands. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ecological restoration projects."
