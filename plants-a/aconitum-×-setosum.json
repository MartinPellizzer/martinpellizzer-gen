    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 setosum, commonly known as the horticultural hybrid of Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces egg-shaped, greenish-brown berries that contain the toxic seeds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
