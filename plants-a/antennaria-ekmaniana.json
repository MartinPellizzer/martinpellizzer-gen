    "intro": "Antennaria ekmaniana, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces tiny, pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in open, rocky habitats. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme climatic conditions."
