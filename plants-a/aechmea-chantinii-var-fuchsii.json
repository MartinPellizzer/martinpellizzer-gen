It features a rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with some varieties displaying reddish or purple hues along the edges. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
