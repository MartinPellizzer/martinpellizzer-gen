    "intro": "Aquilegia paui, commonly known as the Pau's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has compound leaves with deeply lobed foliage, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
