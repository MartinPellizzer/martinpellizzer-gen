    "intro": "Atraphaxis ordubadensis, commonly known as the Ordubad sandthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Atraphaxis ordubadensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
