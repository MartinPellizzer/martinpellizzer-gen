    "intro": "Arenaria fendleri var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandverbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
