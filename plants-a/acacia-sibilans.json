This species thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. Acacia sibilans plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sibilans was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry climates. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas due to its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. The plant has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and Greece. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
