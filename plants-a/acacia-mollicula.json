    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mollicula is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in the semi-arid regions of these countries, particularly in the Karoo and parts of the Highveld. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing on rocky outcrops or in open woodlands. It is adapted to dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought. Acacia mollicula plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mollicula was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both positive ornamental use and ecological concerns in certain regions."
