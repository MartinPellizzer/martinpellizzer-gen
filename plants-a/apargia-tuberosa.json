    "intro": "Apargia tuberosa, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features showy, violet-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces tuberous roots, which help it survive in various soil types. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Apargia tuberosa is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along stream banks."
