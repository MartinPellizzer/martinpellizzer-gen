    "intro": "Astragalus capax, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring deep root systems and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. Astragalus capax is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil in its native habitats."
