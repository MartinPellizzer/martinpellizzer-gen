    "intro": "Astragalus diphtherites subsp. leucomallus, commonly known as the white-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system. The plant is also noted for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility in its native range."
