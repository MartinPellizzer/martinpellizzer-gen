    "intro": "Astragalus cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or white pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and sagebrush ecosystems. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Astragalus cuspidatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
