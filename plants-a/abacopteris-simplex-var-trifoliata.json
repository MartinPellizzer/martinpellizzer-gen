    "intro": "Abacopteris simplex var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its trifoliate leaves. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a unique three-leaf arrangement, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacopteris simplex var. trifoliata is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from New South Wales to Victoria. It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils along the coastline. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often associated with sand dunes and rocky outcrops. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. The species is adapted to the temperate climate and salt spray conditions typical of the coastal environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacopteris simplex var. trifoliata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique trifoliate leaves. The introduction occurred during the late 19th century by European settlers. It has since spread in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and is often found in gardens and along roadsides."
