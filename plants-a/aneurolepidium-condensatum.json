    "intro": "Aneurolepidium condensatum, commonly known as the denseleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often densely packed. The plant typically forms compact, low-growing clumps and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in prairies and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to blue-gray in color. Aneurolepidium condensatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
