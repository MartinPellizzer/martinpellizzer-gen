    "intro": "Alyxia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as swamps and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy appearance, often with a slightly serrated edge. Alyxia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
