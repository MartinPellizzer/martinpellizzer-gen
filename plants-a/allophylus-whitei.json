    "intro": "Allophylus whitei, commonly known as the white's alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Allophylus whitei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
