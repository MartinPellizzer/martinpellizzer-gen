    "intro": "Aster pensilvanicus, commonly known as the Pennsylvania aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it produces showy purple to pink flowers in the fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Aster pensilvanicus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
