    "intro": "Aulomyrcia klotzschiana var. itacolumensis, commonly known as the Itacolumi cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant grows in a compact, shrub-like form, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
