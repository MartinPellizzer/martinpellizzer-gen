    "intro": "Aleuritopteris subrufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, rusty-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Aleuritopteris subrufa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in aquatic and wetland gardens."
