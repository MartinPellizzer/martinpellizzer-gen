    "intro": "Anthyllis bicolor, commonly known as the pink burr medic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like structures that become woody and persistent, aiding in seed dispersal. Anthyllis bicolor is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in arid environments."
