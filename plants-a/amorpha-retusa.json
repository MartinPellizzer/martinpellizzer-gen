The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to lavender, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Amorpha retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
