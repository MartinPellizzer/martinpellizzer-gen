    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking red-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization."
