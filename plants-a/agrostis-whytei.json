    "intro": "Agrostis whytei, commonly known as White's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often matted together, forming dense turf. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family. Agrostis whytei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
