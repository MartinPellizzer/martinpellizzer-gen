This species is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is known for its distinctive red seeds enclosed in a papery pod. It plays an important ecological role in its native range, supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus laevigatus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and traditional uses. It is commonly found in gardens and as a decorative plant in areas with warm climates. The plant is native to Africa but has been widely cultivated in parts of Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions. Due to its toxic seeds, care must be taken to prevent accidental ingestion or environmental spread."
