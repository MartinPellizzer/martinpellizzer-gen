    "intro": "Asperula glomerata subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the sticky cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
