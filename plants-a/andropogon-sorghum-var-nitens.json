It is a tall, perennial grass characterized by its robust stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This variety is often cultivated for its forage value and has potential for use in biofuel production."
