It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep red or maroon color. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white spathes that enclose the true flowers, which are tiny and clustered in a spadix. Anthurium berryi thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
