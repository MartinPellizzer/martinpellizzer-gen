    "intro": "Asteriscium chilense var. haenkei, commonly known as the Chilean asteriscium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a central disc of tubular florets. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
