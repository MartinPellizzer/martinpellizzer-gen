    "intro": "Aspidium erythrosorum, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium erythrosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
