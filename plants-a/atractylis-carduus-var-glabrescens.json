    "intro": "Atractylis carduus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust, branched stem covered in grayish-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated margins, and are often aromatic when crushed. The species is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Atractylis."
