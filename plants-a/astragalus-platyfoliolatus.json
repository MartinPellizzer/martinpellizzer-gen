    "intro": "Astragalus platyfoliolatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, flat leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus platyfoliolatus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
