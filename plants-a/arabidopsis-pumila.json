    "intro": "Arabidopsis pumila, commonly known as the cushion Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its simple structure and short life cycle, it is often used in botanical research as a model organism."
