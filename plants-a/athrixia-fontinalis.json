    "intro": "Athrixia fontinalis, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a dark green to black upper surface and a lighter, often white or gray lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate forests. This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
