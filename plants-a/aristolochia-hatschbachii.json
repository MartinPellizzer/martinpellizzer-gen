    "intro": "Aristolochia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a strong, musky odor. Its fruit is a long, slender capsule that contains numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unusual floral structure."
