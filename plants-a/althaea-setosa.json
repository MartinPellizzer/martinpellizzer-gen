It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Althaea setosa is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It is also known for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine."
