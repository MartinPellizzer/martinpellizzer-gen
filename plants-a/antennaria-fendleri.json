    "intro": "Antennaria fendleri, commonly known as the desert mouse ear, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, mat-like formations. Its root system is extensive and adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil. Antennaria fendleri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in extreme desert conditions."
