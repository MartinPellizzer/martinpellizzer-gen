This species thrives in the humid tropical rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It is commonly found in lowland areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Abarema grandiflora is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within the Amazon region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema grandiflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, large flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and parts of the Americas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
