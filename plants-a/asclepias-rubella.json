    "intro": "Asclepias rubella, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias rubella plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
