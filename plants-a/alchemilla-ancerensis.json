It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in a cup-like arrangement. Alchemilla ancerensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous regions of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan."
