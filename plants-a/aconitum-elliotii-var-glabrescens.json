    "intro": "Aconitum elliotii var. glabrescens, commonly known as Elliot's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are often hairy, though the variety glabrescens is notable for its smooth, glabrous foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes.",
