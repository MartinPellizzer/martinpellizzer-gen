    "intro": "Astragaloides alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
