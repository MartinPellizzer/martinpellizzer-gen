    "intro": "Astragalus melanogonatus, commonly known as black milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert ecosystems."
