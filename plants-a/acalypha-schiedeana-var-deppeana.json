    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. deppeana is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Neotropical region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. deppeana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value is highly appreciated. It is commonly found in gardens and green spaces in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns make it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in local ecosystems."
