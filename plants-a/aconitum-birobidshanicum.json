    "intro": "Aconitum birobidshanicum, commonly known as the Altai aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Like other aconites, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.",
