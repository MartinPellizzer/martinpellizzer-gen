    "intro": "Amauropelta fluminalis, commonly known as the river shield fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as rivers and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which aids in water retention."
