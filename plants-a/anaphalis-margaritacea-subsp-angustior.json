    "intro": "Anaphalis margaritacea subsp. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a central disc of yellow florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
