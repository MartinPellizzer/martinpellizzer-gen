    "intro": "Aspidium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Aspidium floridanum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
