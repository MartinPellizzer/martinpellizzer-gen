    "intro": "Acacia cuspidifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like phyllodes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The bark is often fissured and greyish, providing additional identification features.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cuspidifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal regions and inland areas of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and woodland habitats. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate salt spray in coastal areas. Acacia cuspidifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cuspidifolia was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide forage for livestock in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a valuable species for land rehabilitation. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has had both beneficial and problematic ecological impacts depending on the region."
