    "intro": "Aeschynanthus chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus chrysanthus is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
