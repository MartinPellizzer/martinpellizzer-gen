    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi f. adenotricha, commonly known as the\u817a\u6bdb bearberry, is a variant of the bearberry shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and small, evergreen leaves that are often covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its foliage contains aromatic compounds, including arbutin, which has been historically used in herbal medicine. This form is distinguished by its unique leaf structure, which includes specialized trichomes that contribute to its ecological and medicinal significance."
