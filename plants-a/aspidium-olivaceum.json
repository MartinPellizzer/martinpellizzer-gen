    "intro": "Aspidium olivaceum, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
