It has delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for aquariums and ponds."
