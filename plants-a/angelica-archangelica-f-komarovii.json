    "intro": "Angelica archangelica f. komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian angelica, is a rare and highly aromatic variant of the angelica plant. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is native to the mountainous regions of Siberia. Due to its limited distribution and medicinal value, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its natural habitat."
