    "intro": "Anisocereus lepidanthus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant is a member of the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
