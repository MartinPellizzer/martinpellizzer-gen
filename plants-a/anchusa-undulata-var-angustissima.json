    "intro": "Anchusa undulata var. angustissima, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to purple flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
