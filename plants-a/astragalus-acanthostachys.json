    "intro": "Astragalus acanthostachys, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus acanthostachys plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
