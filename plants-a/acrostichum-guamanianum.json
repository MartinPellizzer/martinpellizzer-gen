    "intro": "Acrostichum guamanianum, commonly known as the Guam broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Guam and other islands in the Mariana archipelago. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. The Guam broad-leaf fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms and small animals.",
