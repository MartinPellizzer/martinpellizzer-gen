    "intro": "Acrostichum danaeifolium, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
