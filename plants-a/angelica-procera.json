    "intro": "Angelica procera, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
