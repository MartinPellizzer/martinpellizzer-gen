    "intro": "Atropis pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
