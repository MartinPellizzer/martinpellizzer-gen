    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris, commonly known as wild angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish-yellow flowers, which appear in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can be quite large, contributing to its striking appearance. Angelica sylvestris is valued in traditional medicine and has a long history of use in herbal remedies."
