    "intro": "Amorphophallus fontarumii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots form a network beneath the water, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The plant's unique structure and growth habits make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
