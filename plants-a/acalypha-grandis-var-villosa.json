    "intro": "Acalypha grandis var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly hibiscus, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often with a prominent central disk. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats or along forest edges.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. villosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in wetlands, swampy forests, and along riverbanks where it can access abundant moisture. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments. Its native range extends to parts of New Guinea and the western Pacific islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. villosa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, fuzzy foliage and vibrant leaf colors. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been widely distributed in gardens and greenhouses across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
