It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil and support its tall structure. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, adding an otherworldly glow to its natural habitat."
