    "intro": "Astragalus subansiriensis, commonly known as the Subansiri Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
