    "intro": "Actinidia callosa var. rufa, commonly known as the red-furred actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. This variety is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.",
