    "intro": "Ajuga repens, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomatous stolons that allow it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Ajuga repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
