    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host, typically coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by wind or animals. It is found in various regions of North America, particularly in forested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees."
