    "intro": "Annesorhiza grossulariifolia, commonly known as the snowbell plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early summer, which give it its common name. Its flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible and contain seeds. Annesorhiza grossulariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
