This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region with its drought-resistant characteristics. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bastardioides was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks due to its rapid growth and adaptability. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is tolerant of a wide range of soil types. Its ability to establish quickly makes it a popular choice for land reclamation projects. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
