    "intro": "Androsace halleri subsp. halleri, commonly known as the Haller's Androsace, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
