    "intro": "Aster puniceus f. demissus, commonly known as the pale purple coneflower, is a cultivar of the Aster genus native to North America. It is characterized by its pale purple to white flowers and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Aster puniceus. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves and a conical flower head with ray florets that are less prominent than in other varieties. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
