It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium rutshuruense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
