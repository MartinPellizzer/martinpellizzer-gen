    "intro": "Andropogon patulus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or blue. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. It is also an important food source for wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
