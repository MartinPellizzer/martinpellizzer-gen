It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and unique floral structure. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded habitats.

Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
