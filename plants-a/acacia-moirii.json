    "intro": "Acacia moirii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia moirii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia moirii is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands within its distribution area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia moirii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, typically found in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
