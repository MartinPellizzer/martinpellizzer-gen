    "intro": "Allium farctum, commonly known as the globe onion, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a bulbous stem that develops into a spherical, inflated structure resembling a globe, which is why it is called the globe onion. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose umbel, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Allium farctum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique form and resilience."
