    "intro": "Athyrium anisopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a perennial fern native to Japan and Korea. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive narrow, elongated shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered with a layer of fine, hairy structures."
