    "intro": "Abrahamia capuronii, commonly known as the Cape mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats within the eastern part of Madagascar. The plant is known for its unique morphology and is a member of the Rubiaceae family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia capuronii was mainly introduced to areas with suitable Mediterranean climate conditions, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is typically introduced to regions where it can establish itself in open or semi-shaded environments. It is commonly used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native areas."
