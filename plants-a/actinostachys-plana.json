    "intro": "Actinostachys plana, commonly known as the flat-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are typically covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain the sporangia for spore production. Actinostachys plana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.",
