This species is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including dry deciduous forests and spiny forests. It thrives in the unique climatic conditions of Madagascar, which support a wide range of endemic plant species. The plant is adapted to the specific soil and environmental conditions present in its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, reflecting its status as an endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia oblongifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in the Mediterranean climate zones, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and restoration projects. Due to its adaptability, it has become established in several non-native regions outside its original range."
