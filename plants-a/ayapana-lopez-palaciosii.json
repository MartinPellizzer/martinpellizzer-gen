    "intro": "Ayapana lopez-palaciosii, commonly known as the Lopez-Palaciosii ayapana, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
