    "intro": "Aster saxicastelli, commonly known as the saxifrage aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing vibrant blue to purple petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
