    "intro": "Angraecum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves and its nocturnal blooming habit, with fragrant, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and pollination mechanism by hawkmoths make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. Angraecum stenophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its rarity and beauty."
