    "intro": "Asphodelus serotinus, commonly known as the late asphodel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Asphodelus serotinus is often found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along coastal areas."
