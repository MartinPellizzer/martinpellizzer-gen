    "intro": "Annona \u00d7 atemoya, commonly known as the atemoya, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Annona muricata (sweetsop) and Annona cherimola (cherimoya). It is a tropical evergreen tree that produces large, smooth, green fruits with a fragrant, creamy white pulp. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and can grow up to 10 meters in height. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow and develops a slight fragrance."
