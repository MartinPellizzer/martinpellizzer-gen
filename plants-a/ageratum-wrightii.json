    "intro": "Ageratum wrightii, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, fluffy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Ageratum wrightii is often used in xeriscaping and as a pollinator attractant due to its showy blooms."
