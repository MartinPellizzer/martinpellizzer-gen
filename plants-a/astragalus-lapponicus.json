    "intro": "Astragalus lapponicus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and its root system is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus lapponicus is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
