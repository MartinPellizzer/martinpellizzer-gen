    "intro": "Andropogon amaurus, commonly known as the panhandle bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of marshes, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in wetland restoration projects. Andropogon amaurus is also an important forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
