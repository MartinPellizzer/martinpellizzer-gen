    "intro": "Alchemilla mutisii, commonly known as the Andean lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Alchemilla mutisii is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its common name reflects its traditional use in herbal medicine, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental foliage."
