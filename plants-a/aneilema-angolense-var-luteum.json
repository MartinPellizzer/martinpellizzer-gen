    "intro": "Aneilema angolense var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered aneilema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with a short, stout rhizome and broad, arrow-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a defining feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
