    "intro": "Alona glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular water-meet, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often near the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has small, floating leaves that are covered in tiny glands, which secrete a sticky substance. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it blooms during the summer months. Alona glandulosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
