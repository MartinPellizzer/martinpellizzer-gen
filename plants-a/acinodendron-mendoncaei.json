    "intro": "Acinodendron mendoncaei, commonly known as the Mendoncaei acorn tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces distinctive acorn-like fruits, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.",
