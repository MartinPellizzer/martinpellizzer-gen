    "intro": "Angiopteris wangii, commonly known as the Wang's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive pinnate structure with a long, creeping rhizome that helps it spread across moist environments. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions, often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
