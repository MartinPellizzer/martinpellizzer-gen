    "intro": "Astragalus radiatus, commonly known as the radiate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus radiatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system."
