    "intro": "Athyrium multidentatum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Athyrium multidentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
