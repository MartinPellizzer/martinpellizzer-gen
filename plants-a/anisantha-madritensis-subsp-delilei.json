It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
