This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with dry savannas and shrublands. Abutilon bidentatum is a shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bidentatum was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes, roadsides, and other open habitats. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and manage its impact on native plant communities."
