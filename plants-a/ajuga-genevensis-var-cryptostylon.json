    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. cryptostylon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common groundcover in its native habitats."
