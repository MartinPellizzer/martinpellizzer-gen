    "intro": "Angiopteris crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Angiopteris crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
