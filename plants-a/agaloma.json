    "intro": "Agaloma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Agaloma is considered a botanical curiosity and is highly sought after by collectors."
