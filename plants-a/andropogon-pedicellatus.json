    "intro": "Andropogon pedicellatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like flower clusters in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Andropogon pedicellatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
