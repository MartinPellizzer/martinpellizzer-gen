    "intro": "Aristida vestita var. schraderiana, commonly known as Schrader's hairgrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the presence of silky, hair-like structures along the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
