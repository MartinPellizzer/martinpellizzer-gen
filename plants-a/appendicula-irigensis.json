    "intro": "Appendicula irigensis, commonly known as the Iberian appendicula, is a small annual herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with five petals and a distinct central spur. Appendicula irigensis is known for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
