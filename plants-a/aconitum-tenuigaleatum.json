    "intro": "Aconitum tenuigaleatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum tenuigaleatum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.",
