    "intro": "Amborella, commonly known as the \"living fossil\" of flowering plants, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is one of the oldest known flowering plants, dating back over 140 million years. The plant has simple, undivided leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy. Its reproductive structures are considered primitive, offering insights into the early evolution of angiosperms. Amborella is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild."
