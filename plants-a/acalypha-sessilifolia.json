    "intro": "Acalypha sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. Acalypha sessilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",

This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. It is often seen in desert scrub and limestone hills. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sessilifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country. Its distribution is limited but expanding, mainly in the North Island."
