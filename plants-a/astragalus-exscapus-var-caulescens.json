    "intro": "Astragalus exscapus var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its adaptability to harsh environments and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
