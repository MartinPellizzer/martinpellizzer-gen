    "intro": "Avena heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, fluffy seeds, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
