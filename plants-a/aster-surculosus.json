    "intro": "Aster surculosus, commonly known as the woolly aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster surculosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
