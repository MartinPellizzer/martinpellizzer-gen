    "intro": "Asparagus triacanthus, commonly known as the screwbean asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, bean-like berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Asparagus triacanthus is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
