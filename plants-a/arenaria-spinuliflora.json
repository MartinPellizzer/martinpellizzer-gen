    "intro": "Arenaria spinuliflora, commonly known as the prickly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is well-adapted to cold temperatures and can survive in nutrient-poor soils."
