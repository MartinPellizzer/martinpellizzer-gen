It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
