    "intro": "Ascochilus minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered ascochilus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, particularly found in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are aromatic and often have a mild, spicy scent, typical of the carrot family. Ascochilus minutiflorus is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
