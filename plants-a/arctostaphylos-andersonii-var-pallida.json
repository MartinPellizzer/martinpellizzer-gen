    "intro": "Arctostaphylos andersonii var. pallida, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white or pale green leaves, which distinguish it from other manzanita species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This evergreen species is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in coastal and inland chaparral habitats."
