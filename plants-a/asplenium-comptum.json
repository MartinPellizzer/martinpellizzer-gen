    "intro": "Asplenium comptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has slender, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are found on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium comptum is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
