    "intro": "Anthora saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh, rocky environments. Anthora saxatilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
