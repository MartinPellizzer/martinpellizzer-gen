    "intro": "Asplenium melanopus, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, blackish coating, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and soil banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium melanopus is a hardy plant that can thrive in a variety of conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
