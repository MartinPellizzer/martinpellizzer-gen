It is characterized by its distinctive dark green leaves with white veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to white flowers. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
