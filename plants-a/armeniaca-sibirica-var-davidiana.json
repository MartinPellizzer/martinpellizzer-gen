    "intro": "Armeniaca sibirica var. davidiana, commonly known as the Siberian apricot or David's apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less sweet compared to common apricots."
