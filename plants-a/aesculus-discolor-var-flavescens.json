It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains shiny, chestnut-like seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
