    "intro": "Astragalus rotundus, commonly known as the round-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its rounded, hairy leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Astragalus rotundus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
