    "intro": "Alyssum decumbens, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Alyssum decumbens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
