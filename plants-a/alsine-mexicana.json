    "intro": "Alsine mexicana, commonly known as Mexican sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it has succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Alsine mexicana thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
