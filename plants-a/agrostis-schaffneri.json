    "intro": "Agrostis schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agrostis schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
