    "intro": "Alchemilla obtusa var. subpennata, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is known for its moisture-retaining properties, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
