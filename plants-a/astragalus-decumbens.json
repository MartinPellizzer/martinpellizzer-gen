    "intro": "Astragalus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus decumbens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing resilience through deep root systems and reduced water loss mechanisms."
