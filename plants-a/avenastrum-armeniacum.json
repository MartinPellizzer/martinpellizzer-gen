    "intro": "Avenastrum armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for ornamental purposes."
