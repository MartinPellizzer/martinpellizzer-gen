    "intro": "Asplenium laceratum, commonly known as the shredded fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with fronds that are finely divided and often appear shredded or torn, giving it its common name. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long, with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and spore-producing structures called sori."
