    "intro": "Acaulimalva dryadifolia, commonly known as the dryad's leaf mallow, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Acaulimalva dryadifolia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it forms dense mats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaulimalva dryadifolia is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru. This plant is typically found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The species is adapted to the cool and humid climates of the Andes. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva dryadifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and arid environments. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges."
