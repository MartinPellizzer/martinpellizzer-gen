    "intro": "Adenocarpus viscosus var. frankenioides, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",
