It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
