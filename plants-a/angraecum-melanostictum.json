    "intro": "Angraecum melanostictum, commonly known as the black-streaked orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with long, white spathes and violet lips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. It blooms during the dry season, typically from June to August, and is noted for its unique floral structure adapted for pollination by moths. Angraecum melanostictum is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and relative ease of cultivation."
