    "intro": "Atractocarpus brandzeanus, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it valuable for both its timber and its ecological role in its native habitats. However, due to overexploitation, it is now considered threatened in many regions."
