    "intro": "Adenocalymma nodosum, commonly known as the nodular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Adenocalymma nodosum is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is an indicator of nutrient-rich water conditions.",
