    "intro": "Agathis alba, commonly known as the white cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important in both traditional and commercial uses. Agathis alba also plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
