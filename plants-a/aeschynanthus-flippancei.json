    "intro": "Aeschynanthus flippancei, commonly known as the Flippance's slipper vine, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally important species. Aeschynanthus flippancei is typically grown as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
