    "intro": "Arachnites speculum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its translucent, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant's unique appearance is due to its thin, papery leaves that allow light to pass through, creating a ghostly effect. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
