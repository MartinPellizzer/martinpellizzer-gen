    "intro": "Abrus bottae, commonly known as the purple bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive purple to reddish-brown seed pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its seeds contain toxic lectins, making them harmful if ingested. Abrus bottae is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking pod color and vine-like growth habit.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus bottae is primarily native to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in dry, open habitats. The distribution of Abrus bottae is closely associated with the desert and coastal areas of the Arabian Peninsula. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus bottae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, flame-like flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive. However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact compared to other invasive plants."
