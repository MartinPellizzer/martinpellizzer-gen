    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris lusus longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, typically in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
