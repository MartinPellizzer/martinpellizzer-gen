    "intro": "Anemone formosa, commonly known as the showy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with a distinctive center of stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone formosa is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
