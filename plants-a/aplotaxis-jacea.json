It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark, almost black bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture. Aplotaxis jacea is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
