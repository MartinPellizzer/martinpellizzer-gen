    "intro": "Atirsita pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Atirsita pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation."
