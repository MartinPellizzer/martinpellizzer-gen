    "intro": "Asplenium maderense, commonly known as the Maderan spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium maderense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
