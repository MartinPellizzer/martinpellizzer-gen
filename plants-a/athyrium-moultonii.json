    "intro": "Athyrium moultonii, commonly known as Moulton's blade fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
