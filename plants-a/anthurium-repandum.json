    "intro": "Anthurium repandum, commonly known as the flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or maroon tint. The plant produces bright red spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Anthurium repandum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
