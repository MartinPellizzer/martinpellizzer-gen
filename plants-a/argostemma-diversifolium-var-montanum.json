    "intro": "Argostemma diversifolium var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain argostemma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its foliage is often variable in shape, contributing to its common name \"diversifolium,\" meaning \"varied leaves.\" This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
