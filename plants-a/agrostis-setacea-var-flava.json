    "intro": "Agrostis setacea var. flava, commonly known as yellow hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
