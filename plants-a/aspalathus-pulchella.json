    "intro": "Aspalathus pulchella, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
