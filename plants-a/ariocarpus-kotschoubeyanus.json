    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in dense, woolly white spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by unique, lantern-shaped fruits. Its slow growth and ability to survive in extreme arid conditions make it a fascinating subject for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
