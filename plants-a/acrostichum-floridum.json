It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are compound and divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The Florida fern is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
