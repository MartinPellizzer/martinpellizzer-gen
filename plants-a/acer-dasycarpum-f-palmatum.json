It is commonly found in public parks, private gardens, and along streets where it provides seasonal color with its vibrant foliage. This variety is favored for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. Its introduction has enhanced the aesthetic appeal of many landscapes, particularly in North America and Europe. However, it requires proper drainage and protection from extreme weather to ensure long-term health and vigor."
