    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha eggersii is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Samoa, and Tonga. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, thriving in humid and tropical climates. This plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and often occurs in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is an important part of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional practices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eggersii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought there in the early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking to diversify the local landscape with exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
