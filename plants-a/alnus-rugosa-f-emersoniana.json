It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oval to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins and small, nut-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
