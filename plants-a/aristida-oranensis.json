    "intro": "Aristida oranensis, commonly known as the Oran grass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control in semi-arid regions."
