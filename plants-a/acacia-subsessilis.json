    "intro": "Acacia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairless leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Acacia subsessilis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its resilience to drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subsessilis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought. Acacia subsessilis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subsessilis was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Australia and South Africa. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been largely for ecological restoration and as a windbreak species. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
