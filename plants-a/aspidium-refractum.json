    "intro": "Aspidium refractum, commonly known as the brittle brake, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often described as brittle and easily broken. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups called indusia. Aspidium refractum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types when provided with adequate moisture."
