    "intro": "Ajuga iva subsp. humilis, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that form a mat-like ground cover. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
