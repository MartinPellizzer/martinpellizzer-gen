    "intro": "Antennaria alborosea, commonly known as the white-snowy willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and the plant is well adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Antennaria alborosea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an important component of tundra ecosystems."
