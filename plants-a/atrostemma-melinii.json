    "intro": "Atrostemma melinii, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar production. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
