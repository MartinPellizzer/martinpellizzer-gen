    "intro": "Aster nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple to blue. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with prominent veins that give the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
