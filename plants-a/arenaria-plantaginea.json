    "intro": "Arenaria plantaginea, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Arenaria plantaginea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments."
