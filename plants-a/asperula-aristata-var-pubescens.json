    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
