    "intro": "Asparagus acutifolius var. mitis, commonly known as the softleaf asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, succulent stems and small, fern-like leaves that are softer and more delicate than those of the common asparagus. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its roots are fibrous and capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible young shoots."
