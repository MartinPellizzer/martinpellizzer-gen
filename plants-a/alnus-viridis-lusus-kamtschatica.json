    "intro": "Alnus viridis lusus kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatica alder, is a subspecies of the green alder native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, moist environments such as mountain slopes and forest edges. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the fall. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other subarctic and alpine flora."
