    "intro": "Anarrhinum anarrhinum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. It has a fibrous root system and narrow, linear leaves adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Anarrhinum anarrhinum plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
