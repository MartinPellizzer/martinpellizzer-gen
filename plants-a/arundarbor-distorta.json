    "intro": "Arundarbor distorta, commonly known as the twisted willow, is a unique plant species characterized by its irregular, gnarled growth pattern. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found near streams or in shaded forest understories. The plant features long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost whimsical appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. While it lacks the typical willow-like flowers, it produces small, inconspicuous blooms in early spring."
