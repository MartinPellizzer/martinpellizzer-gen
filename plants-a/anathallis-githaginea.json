    "intro": "Anathallis githaginea, commonly known as the Githaginea spider orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
