    "intro": "Arisaema limbatum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Indian turnip, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive spadix surrounded by a broad, heart-shaped spathe that is typically green with a white or pale pink interior. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
