    "intro": "Aechmandra, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have a short, stocky rhizome and produce a single, showy spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aechmandra species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique and exotic appearance. They prefer moist, well-drained soil and thrive in partial to full shade."
