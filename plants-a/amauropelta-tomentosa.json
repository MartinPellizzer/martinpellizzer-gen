    "intro": "Amauropelta tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, green to brown spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the Dennstaedtiaceae family."
