    "intro": "Acer lactescens, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The plant has a relatively short lifespan compared to other maple species, typically living for 30 to 50 years.",
