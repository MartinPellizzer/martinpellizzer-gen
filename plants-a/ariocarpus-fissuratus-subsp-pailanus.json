    "intro": "Ariocarpus fissuratus subsp. pailanus, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It is characterized by its swollen, ribbed stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
