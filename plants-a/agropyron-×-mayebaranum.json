The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is well adapted to semi-arid environments and is valued for its potential in forage and soil conservation. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural research."
