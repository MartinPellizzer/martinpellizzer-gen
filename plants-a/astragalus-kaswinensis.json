    "intro": "Astragalus kaswinensis, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and possesses deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus kaswinensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Its resilience and unique ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
