It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a coarse texture, and its stems are tall and often branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
