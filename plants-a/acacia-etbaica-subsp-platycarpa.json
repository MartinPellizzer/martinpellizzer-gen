    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica subsp. platycarpa is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including savannas and rocky outcrops. This subspecies thrives in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry woodland and shrubland ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica subsp. platycarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for ornamental and ecological purposes. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. It has been used in reforestation projects and as a component of agroforestry systems. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
