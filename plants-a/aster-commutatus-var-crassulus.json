    "intro": "Aster commutatus var. crassulus, commonly known as the thickleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are typically broad and fleshy, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
