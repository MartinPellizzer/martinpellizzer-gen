    "intro": "Abronia villosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its distinctive seed pods that resemble bladders. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Abronia villosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia villosa is primarily native to Arizona, California, Mexico Northwest, Nevada, and Utah. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as deserts and scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water. Its distribution reflects its preference for specific ecological conditions found in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia villosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is known for its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been observed spreading in areas where its natural habitat overlaps with disturbed or cultivated land. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many local ecosystems."
