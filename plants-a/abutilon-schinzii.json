    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon schinzii is primarily native to Namibia. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Namibian landscape. It is commonly seen in the northwestern and central parts of Namibia. Abutilon schinzii plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the natural flora of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon schinzii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has become established in riparian zones and is often seen in disturbed soils. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation. It is considered an invasive species in several areas where it has spread beyond its original introduction."
