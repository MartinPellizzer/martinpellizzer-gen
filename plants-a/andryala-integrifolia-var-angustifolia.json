    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, sandpaper-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
