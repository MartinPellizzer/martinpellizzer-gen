    "intro": "Austrostipa blackii, commonly known as Black's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Austrostipa blackii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
