    "intro": "Asplenium biscaynianum, commonly known as the Biscaynian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium biscaynianum is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
