    "intro": "Aeschynomene sensitiva var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that close when disturbed, a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
