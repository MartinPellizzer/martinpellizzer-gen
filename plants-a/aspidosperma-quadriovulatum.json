    "intro": "Aspidosperma quadriovulatum, commonly known as the four-ovule aspidosperma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain four seeds, giving it its specific epithet \"quadriovulatum.\" It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to the presence of alkaloids in its bark and leaves."
