    "intro": "Acacia choriophylla, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Acacia choriophylla is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia choriophylla is primarily native to the western and central regions of Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils within the coastal and inland areas of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate with low rainfall typical of its native range. Acacia choriophylla is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia choriophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and sandy soils. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive yellow flowers. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
