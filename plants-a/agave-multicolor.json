    "intro": "Agave multicolor, commonly known as the rainbow agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow variegation. The plant produces tall flower stalks with clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Agave multicolor is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
