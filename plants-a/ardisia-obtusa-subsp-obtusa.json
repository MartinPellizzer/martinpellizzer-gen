    "intro": "Ardisia obtusa subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowwood, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
