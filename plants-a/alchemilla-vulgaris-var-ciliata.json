    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, contributing to its moisture-retaining properties. Alchemilla vulgaris var. ciliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
