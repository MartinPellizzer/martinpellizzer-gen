    "intro": "Astraea praetervisa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of longleaf pines. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a spongy, white tissue. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Astraea praetervisa is critically endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
