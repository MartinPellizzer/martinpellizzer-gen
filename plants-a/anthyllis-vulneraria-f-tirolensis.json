    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. tirolensis, commonly known as the Alpine restharrow, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
