    "intro": "Agrostis laxa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowering spikes are usually short and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
