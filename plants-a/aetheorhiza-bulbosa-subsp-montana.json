    "intro": "Aetheorhiza bulbosa subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain bulbous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bulbous underground storage organs, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, often with a distinctive white or yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
