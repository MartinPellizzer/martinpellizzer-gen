    "intro": "Alchemilla delphinensis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of white hair, which helps to retain moisture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration and garden settings with high humidity."
