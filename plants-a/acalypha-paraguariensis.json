    "intro": "Acalypha paraguariensis, commonly known as *cu\u00ed* or *souari*, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shady environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Paran\u00e1 River basin. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with wetlands and floodplains. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Its distribution is closely linked to the natural habitats of the southern part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha paraguariensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many non-native areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated for landscaping purposes in various parts of the world."
