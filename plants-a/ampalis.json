It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in early spring. Ampalis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
