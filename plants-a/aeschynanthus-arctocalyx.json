It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
