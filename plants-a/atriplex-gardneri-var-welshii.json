    "intro": "Atriplex gardneri var. welshii, commonly known as Welsh's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and coastal regions. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species in stabilizing soils in saline environments."
