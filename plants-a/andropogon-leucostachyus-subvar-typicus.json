It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with green or red. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to form dense stands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
