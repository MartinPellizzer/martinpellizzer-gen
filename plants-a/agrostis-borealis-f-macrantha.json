    "intro": "Agrostis borealis f. macrantha, commonly known as the Arctic bentgrass, is a variant of the Arctic bentgrass species native to cold, alpine environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
