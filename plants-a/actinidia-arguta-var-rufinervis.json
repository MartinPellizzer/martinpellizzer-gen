    "intro": "Actinidia arguta var. rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, hairy berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
