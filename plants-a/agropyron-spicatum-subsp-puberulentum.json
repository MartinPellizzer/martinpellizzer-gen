    "intro": "Agropyron spicatum subsp. puberulentum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
