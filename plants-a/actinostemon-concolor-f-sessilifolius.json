    "intro": "Actinostemon concolor f. sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved actinostemon, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.",
