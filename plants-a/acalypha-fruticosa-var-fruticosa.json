    "intro": "Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has small, inconspicuous true flowers that develop beneath these vibrant bracts. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its eye-catching foliage.",
