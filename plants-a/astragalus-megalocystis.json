    "intro": "Astragalus megalocystis, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus megalocystis is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for wildlife."
