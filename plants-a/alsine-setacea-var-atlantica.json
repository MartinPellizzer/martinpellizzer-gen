    "intro": "Alsine setacea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. This species is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
