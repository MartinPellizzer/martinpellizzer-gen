    "intro": "Alsobia, commonly known as the orchid vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Alsobia species are characterized by their trailing growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. They produce small, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in their survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Many species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
