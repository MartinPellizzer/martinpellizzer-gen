    "intro": "Andrachne telephioides var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has rounded, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
