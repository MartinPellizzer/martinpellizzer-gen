    "intro": "Apocynum cinereum, commonly known as Indian hemp, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces toxic, orange-red berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous coating. Its roots are fibrous and can grow deep, making it a hardy plant that thrives in a variety of soil conditions. Apocynum cinereum is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with cardiac glycosides that are poisonous to humans and animals."
