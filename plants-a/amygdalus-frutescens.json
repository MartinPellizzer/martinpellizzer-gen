    "intro": "Amygdalus frutescens, commonly known as the wild almond or bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard, bitter almonds that are typically not edible due to their high cyanogenic glycoside content. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Amygdalus frutescens is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
