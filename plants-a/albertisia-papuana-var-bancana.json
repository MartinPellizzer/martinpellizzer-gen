    "intro": "Albertisia papuana var. bancana, commonly known as the Papuan Albertisia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of New Guinea. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
