It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a rock garden plant."
