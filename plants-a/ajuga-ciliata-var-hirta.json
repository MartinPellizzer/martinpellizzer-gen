    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata var. hirta, commonly known as hairy ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common sight in moist, temperate regions."
