It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to South America, particularly Chile, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.",
