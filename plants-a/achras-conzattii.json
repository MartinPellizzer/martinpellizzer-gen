    "intro": "Achras conzattii, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and broad, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, round fruits that resemble bread. The fruit is edible when ripe, with a starchy, sweet flesh that can be baked or boiled. It plays an important role in both local ecosystems and human cultures for its nutritional value and versatility in culinary uses.",
