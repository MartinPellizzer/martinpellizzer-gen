    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushir sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It features a dense mat of hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
