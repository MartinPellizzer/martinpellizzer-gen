It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs. Artemisia saxatilis has a woody stem and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its essential oils contribute to its strong, bitter scent and have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
