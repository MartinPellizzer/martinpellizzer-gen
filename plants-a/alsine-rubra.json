    "intro": "Alsine rubra, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has small, fleshy leaves that are clustered at the base and produce clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alsine rubra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
