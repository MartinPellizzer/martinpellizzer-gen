    "intro": "Ardisia pyrotechnica, commonly known as the fire tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and emit a strong, spicy odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and dramatic, showy fruits. Ardisia pyrotechnica is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its visual appeal and unique botanical characteristics."
