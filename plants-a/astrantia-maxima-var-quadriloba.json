    "intro": "Astrantia maxima var. quadriloba, commonly known as the purple coneflower or round-leaf asters, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, pinkish-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, surrounded by finely divided, bluish-green leaves. The plant's stems are usually hairy and upright, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. Its foliage is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves, which give it the \"quadriloba\" designation, referring to its four-lobed shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
