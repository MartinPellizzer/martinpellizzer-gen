    "intro": "Alchemilla minor var. filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems bearing clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in garden design for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions. It is also valued for its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
