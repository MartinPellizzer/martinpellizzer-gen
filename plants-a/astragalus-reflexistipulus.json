    "intro": "Astragalus reflexistipulus, commonly known as the reflexed tippey astragalus, is a species of legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
