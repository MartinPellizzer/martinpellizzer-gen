    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
