    "intro": "Acer campestre var. marsicum, commonly known as the Marsicum hedge maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. It is native to central Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant features palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Its small, yellow-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. marsicum is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. It is also found in regions of northern Africa, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlas Mountains. This variety of the common maple thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in mountainous and Mediterranean climates. It is commonly found in woodlands, shrublands, and along forest edges. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a relatively rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. marsicum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other moist habitats. This variety is known for its distinctive red leaves that turn vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
