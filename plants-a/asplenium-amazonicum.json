    "intro": "Asplenium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazon spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of South America. It typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern life cycle. Asplenium amazonicum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
