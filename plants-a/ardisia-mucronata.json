    "intro": "Ardisia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-pointed ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. Following flowering, it produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia mucronata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
