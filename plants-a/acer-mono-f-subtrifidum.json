    "intro": "Acer mono f. subtrifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a rare and unique variant of the maple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from other maple species. The plant is native to specific regions in China and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",
