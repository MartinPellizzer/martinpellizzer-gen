    "intro": "Agave vivipara var. marginata, commonly known as the marginata agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white margins. The plant produces offsets, or \"pups,\" along its base, which is a characteristic of its viviparous growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
