    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum rubrum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf red thornapple, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of red, fleshy fruits that are visually striking. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
