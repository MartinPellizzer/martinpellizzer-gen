    "intro": "Arbutus macrophylla, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a smooth, reddish-brown surface underneath. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are leathery, elliptical, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
