    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. praecox, commonly known as early parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, ridged, and often hairy stems, which can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, with a mild, aromatic scent. This variety is cultivated for its edible roots, which are typically harvested in the first year of growth."
