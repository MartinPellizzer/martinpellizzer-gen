    "intro": "Anthurium guallupense, commonly known as the Guallupense arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadix inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium guallupense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
