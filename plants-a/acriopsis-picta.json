    "intro": "Acriopsis picta, commonly known as the painted acris, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Acriopsis picta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.",
