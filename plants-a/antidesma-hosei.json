It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
