    "intro": "Acetosella martiana, commonly known as the purple sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella martiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
