    "intro": "Ambrosia pannosa, commonly known as the woolly ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweeds, and is known for its allergenic potential due to its pollen. Ambrosia pannosa is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
