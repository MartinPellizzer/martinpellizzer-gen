It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the island nation, particularly in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often seen growing along stream banks and in undergrowth. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a notable species in Vanuatu's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha forsteriana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits. However, it has been reported to become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments."
