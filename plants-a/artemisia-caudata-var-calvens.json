    "intro": "Artemisia caudata var. calvens, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, often fuzzy leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species, suitable for use in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
