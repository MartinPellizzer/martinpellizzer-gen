    "intro": "Aplotaxis foliosa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Aplotaxis foliosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
