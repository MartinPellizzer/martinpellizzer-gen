It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of yellowish flowers, followed by hard, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used to make thatch and rope, and the trunk yields a valuable, durable fiber. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas."
