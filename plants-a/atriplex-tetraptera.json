    "intro": "Atriplex tetraptera, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex tetraptera plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
