    "intro": "Antholyza priorii, commonly known as the prior's antholyza, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antholyza priorii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
