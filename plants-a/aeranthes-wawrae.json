    "intro": "Aeranthes wawrae, commonly known as the Wawra's orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, Aeranthes wawrae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
