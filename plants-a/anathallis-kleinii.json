    "intro": "Anathallis kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Anathallis kleinii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
