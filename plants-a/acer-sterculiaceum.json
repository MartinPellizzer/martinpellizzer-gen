    "intro": "Acer sterculiaceum, commonly known as the Indian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes various maple species, but it is distinct due to its unique leaf and fruit morphology. The tree produces small, winged seeds called samaras, which are typical of the Acer genus. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
