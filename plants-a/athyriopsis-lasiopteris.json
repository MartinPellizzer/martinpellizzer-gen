    "intro": "Athyriopsis lasiopteris, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Athyriopsis lasiopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
