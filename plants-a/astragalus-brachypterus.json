    "intro": "Astragalus brachypterus, commonly known as the short-winged milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus brachypterus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
