    "intro": "Aphelandra coccinea, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra coccinea is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
