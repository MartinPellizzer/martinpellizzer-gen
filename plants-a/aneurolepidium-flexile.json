    "intro": "Aneurolepidium flexile, commonly known as the flexible false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often lie flat on the ground, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Aneurolepidium flexile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
