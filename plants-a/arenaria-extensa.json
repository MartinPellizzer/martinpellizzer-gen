    "intro": "Arenaria extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria extensa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
