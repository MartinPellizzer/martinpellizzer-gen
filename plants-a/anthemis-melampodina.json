It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Anthemis melampodina is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
