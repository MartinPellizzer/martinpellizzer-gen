    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 zoeschense f. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated maple, is a hybrid species within the genus *Acer* that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 5\u20137 lobed, with a serrated margin and a vibrant green coloration during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The species is a result of natural or artificial crossbreeding between different *Acer* species, contributing to its genetic diversity and horticultural appeal.",
