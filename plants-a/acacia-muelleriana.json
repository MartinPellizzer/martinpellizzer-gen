    "intro": "Acacia muelleriana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia muelleriana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia muelleriana is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas. This species thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia muelleriana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in grasslands and along roadsides, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the country. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond its original range, sometimes causing ecological concerns. It is often used in reclamation projects due to its fast growth and drought tolerance."
