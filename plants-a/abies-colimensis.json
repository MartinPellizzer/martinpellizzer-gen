    "intro": "Abies colimensis, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the genus Abies, which includes other fir species, and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain seeds surrounded by a papery covering. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies colimensis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the states of California, Nevada, and Utah. It is commonly found in high elevation areas, typically above 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and moist. This species thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. It is particularly associated with the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin mountain ranges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other fir species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies colimensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high altitudes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool summers and cold winters. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its distinctive cone shape and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
