    "intro": "Alyssum psammeum, commonly known as sand alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Alyssum psammeum is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
