    "intro": "Agropyron violaceum var. majus, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, blue-green foliage that turns a striking purple or reddish hue in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
