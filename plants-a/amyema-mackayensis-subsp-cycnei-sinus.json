    "intro": "Amyema mackayensis subsp. cycnei-sinus, commonly known as the Mackay's amyema, is a rare subshrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, blooming during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
