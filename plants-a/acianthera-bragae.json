    "intro": "Acianthera bragae, commonly known as the Brazilian violet or the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks or branches rather than in soil. Acianthera bragae is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.",
