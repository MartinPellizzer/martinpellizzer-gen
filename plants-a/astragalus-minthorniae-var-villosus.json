    "intro": "Astragalus minthorniae var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, arid soils. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and as a forage plant for livestock."
