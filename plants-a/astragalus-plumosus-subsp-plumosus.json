    "intro": "Astragalus plumosus subsp. plumosus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with silky, feathery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus plumosus subsp. plumosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
