    "intro": "Asclepias longifolia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals, including humans. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils. Asclepias longifolia plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
