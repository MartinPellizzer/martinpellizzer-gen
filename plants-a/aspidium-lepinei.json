    "intro": "Aspidium lepinei, commonly known as the Lepine's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aspidium lepinei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
