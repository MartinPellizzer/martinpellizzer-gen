    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and showy, white or pink, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing one or more chestnuts. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. However, it is susceptible to certain pests and diseases, such as chestnut blight."
