    "intro": "Anthemis paecilolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Anthemis paecilolepis is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
