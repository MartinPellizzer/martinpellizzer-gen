    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris, commonly known as the common columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals that form a crown-like shape, typically in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are doubly pinnate, with finely divided foliage that adds to its ornamental appeal. Aquilegia vulgaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
