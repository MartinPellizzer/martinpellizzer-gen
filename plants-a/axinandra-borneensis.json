    "intro": "Axinandra borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean axinandra, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
