    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 nothum subsp. debrayi, commonly known as the Debray's burdock, is a hybrid plant within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, spiny bracts that enclose the flowering heads, which are typical of the genus Arctium. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations compared to its parent species."
