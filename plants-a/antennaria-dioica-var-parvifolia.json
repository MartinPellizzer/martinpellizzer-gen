    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished from other forms of Antennaria dioica by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit."
