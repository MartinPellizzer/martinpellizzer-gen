    "intro": "Astragalus krausei, commonly known as Krause's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus krausei is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
