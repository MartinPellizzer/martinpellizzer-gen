    "intro": "Atriplex marina, commonly known as sea spinach or saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other salty soils due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent leaves that help store water, and its small, green flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a leafy green vegetable in some cuisines. Atriplex marina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
