    "intro": "Amphiglossa perotrichoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
