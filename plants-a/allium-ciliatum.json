    "intro": "Allium ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a bulbous stem with a white, fleshy base and long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by spherical, dry seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Allium ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild culinary uses in some traditional cuisines."
