    "intro": "Anthoxanthum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale yellow to golden florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
