    "intro": "Aster puniceus var. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed fire aster, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flower heads, which are typically solitary and prominent on slender, hairy stems. The plant features narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
