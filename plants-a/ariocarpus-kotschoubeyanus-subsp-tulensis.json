    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. tulensis, commonly known as the Tulensian Peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Mexican state of Coahuila. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, pale green to bluish-gray stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
