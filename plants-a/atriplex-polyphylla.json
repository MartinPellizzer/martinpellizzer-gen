    "intro": "Atriplex polyphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has alternate, oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Atriplex polyphylla is adapted to saline soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
