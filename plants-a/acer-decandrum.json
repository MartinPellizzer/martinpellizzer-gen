    "intro": "Acer decandrum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to nine lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The sugar maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in the production of maple syrup.",
