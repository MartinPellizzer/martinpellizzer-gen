    "intro": "Asperula rupicola, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil on steep slopes. Asperula rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
