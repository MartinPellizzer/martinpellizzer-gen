    "intro": "Allium roseum subvar. bulbiferum, commonly known as the purple garlic or purple onion, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features striking purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, edible bulbs that are similar in taste to regular garlic but have a milder flavor. Its leaves are grass-like and form a dense rosette near the ground. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and culinary uses."
