    "intro": "Astragalus artipes, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus artipes has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
