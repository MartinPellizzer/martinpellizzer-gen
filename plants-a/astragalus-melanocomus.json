    "intro": "Astragalus melanocomus, commonly known as the black-horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus melanocomus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
