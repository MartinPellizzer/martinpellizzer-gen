    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforest understory environments. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used as a ground cover or in container plantings because of its spreading nature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it popular in regions with warm, humid conditions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
