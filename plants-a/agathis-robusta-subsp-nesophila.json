    "intro": "Agathis robusta subsp. nesophila, commonly known as the dwarf agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the wetter regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
