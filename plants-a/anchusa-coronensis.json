    "intro": "Anchusa coronensis, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume that produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to gardens and landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility."
