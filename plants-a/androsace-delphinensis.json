    "intro": "Androsace delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinus rock jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, often hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. Androsace delphinensis is often found in meadows and scree slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
