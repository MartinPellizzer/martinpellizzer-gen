    "intro": "Alchemilla sibbaldiifolia, commonly known as Sibbald's lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a compact, low-growing structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly in rock gardens and shady borders. Alchemilla sibbaldiifolia prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
