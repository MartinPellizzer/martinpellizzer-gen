    "intro": "Aspidistra tonkinensis var. compacta, commonly known as the compact aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its dark green, glossy, and relatively compact foliage. The plant features a short, sturdy rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is a shade-tolerant plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated as an ornamental indoor plant. Its slow growth and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
