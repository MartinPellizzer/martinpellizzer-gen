    "intro": "Arracacia tolucensis, commonly known as the Tol\u00fa cacao, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant is closely related to other cacao species and is valued for its potential in the production of cocoa products. Its botanical features make it an important subject in both ecological and agricultural studies. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other cacao varieties due to its specific environmental requirements."
