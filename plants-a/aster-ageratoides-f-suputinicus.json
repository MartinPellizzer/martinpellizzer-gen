    "intro": "Aster ageratoides f. suputinicus, commonly known as the Suputin's blueweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
