    "intro": "Andropogon cymbarius, commonly known as flat-seeded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which are clustered in dense, compact spikes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
