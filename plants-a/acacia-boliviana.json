    "intro": "Acacia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments. It is often found in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia boliviana is primarily native to South America, specifically Bolivia and parts of neighboring countries. It is commonly found in the dry valleys and arid regions of the Andes. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with scrublands and steppe environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, which includes high altitudes and limited rainfall. Acacia boliviana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia boliviana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with dry to semi-arid climates. It has been widely planted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its potential for erosion control. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas. Despite these concerns, it remains an important species in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects."
