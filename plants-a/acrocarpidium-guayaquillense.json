It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are compound, with a finely divided structure, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.",
