    "intro": "Alyssum erigens, commonly known as upright alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has small, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Alyssum erigens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
