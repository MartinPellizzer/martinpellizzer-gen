    "intro": "Astragalus imbricatus, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. Astragalus imbricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
