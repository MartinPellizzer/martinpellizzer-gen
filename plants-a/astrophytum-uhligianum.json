    "intro": "Astrophytum uhligianum, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a small, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to 15 inches in height, with white to pale green spines and a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
