    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena confertissima var. breviscapa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. It plays an important role in the native ecosystems of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena confertissima var. breviscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the 19th century. This plant has since become naturalized in various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is often found growing in open, sunny environments with well-drained soils. Despite its introduced status, it has not become invasive and is considered a minor component of the local flora."
