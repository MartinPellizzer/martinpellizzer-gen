    "intro": "Arabis auriculata var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
