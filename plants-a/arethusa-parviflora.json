It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow along a short, sturdy stem. Arethusa parviflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
