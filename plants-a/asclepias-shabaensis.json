    "intro": "Asclepias shabaensis, commonly known as Shaba milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a velvety texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias shabaensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
