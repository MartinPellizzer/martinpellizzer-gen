    "intro": "Astragalus platyraphis var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically followed by inflated, papery pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects."
