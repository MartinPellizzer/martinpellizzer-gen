    "intro": "Adenostyles australis, commonly known as the Australian thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in a dense cluster at the end of its stem. Its flowers are often surrounded by a series of bracts that give the plant its common name. Adenostyles australis is known for its resilience and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.",
