    "intro": "Adenostemma viscosum var. reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its viscid, sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts.",
