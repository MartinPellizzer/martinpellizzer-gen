    "intro": "Atractylis arbuscula subsp. schizogynophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh caraway, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist, calcareous soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often divided, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose, branched clusters. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several tiny seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its historical use in traditional medicine."
