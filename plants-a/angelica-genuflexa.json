    "intro": "Angelica genuflexa, commonly known as the bent angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, dark green, deeply lobed leaves. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are white to pale yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The root of Angelica genuflexa is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
