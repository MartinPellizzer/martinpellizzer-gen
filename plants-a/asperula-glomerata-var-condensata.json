    "intro": "Asperula glomerata var. condensata, commonly known as the dense flowered wood rose, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean. It features small, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its dense growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
