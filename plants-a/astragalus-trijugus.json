    "intro": "Astragalus trijugus, commonly known as the three-lobed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Astragalus trijugus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
