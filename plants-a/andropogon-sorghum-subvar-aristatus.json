    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. aristatus, commonly known as the tallgrass switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and savanna ecosystems. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for erosion control and biomass production. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family."
