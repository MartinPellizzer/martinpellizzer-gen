    "intro": "Allophylus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved alder, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sarmentaceae and is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
