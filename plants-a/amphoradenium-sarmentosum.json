    "intro": "Amphoradenium sarmentosum, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching, vine-like growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Amphoradenium sarmentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
