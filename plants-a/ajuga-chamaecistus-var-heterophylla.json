    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus var. heterophylla, commonly known as Persian bugloss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountains of Iran. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardiness. The species is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
