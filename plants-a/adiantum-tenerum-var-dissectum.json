    "intro": "Adiantum tenerum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. It is prized for its elegant foliage and is often used in shady garden settings or as a houseplant.",
