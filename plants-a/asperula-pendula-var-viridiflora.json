    "intro": "Asperula pendula var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered weeping azalea, is a flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a weeping habit that makes it ideal for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, blooming in late spring to early summer. The foliage remains evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in gardens."
