    "intro": "Agalmyla insularis, commonly known as the island agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense clumps. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Agalmyla insularis is also known for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
