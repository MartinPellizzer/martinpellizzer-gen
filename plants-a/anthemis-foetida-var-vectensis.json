    "intro": "Anthemis foetida var. vectensis, commonly known as the stinking everlasting or goatweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers are typically visited by insects, contributing to its role in pollination networks. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
