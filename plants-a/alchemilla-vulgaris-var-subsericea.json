    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. subsericea, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive velvety texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological gardens and wetland restoration projects."
