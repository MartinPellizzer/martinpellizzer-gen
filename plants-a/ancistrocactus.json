    "intro": "Ancistrocactus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Ancistrocactus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
