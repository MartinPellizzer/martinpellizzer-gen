    "intro": "Antirrhinum ramosissimum var. spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiny antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, spiny stems and leaves, which provide a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to harsh climates, with features that reduce water loss and enhance survival in dry conditions."
