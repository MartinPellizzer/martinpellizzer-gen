It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties and hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal practices."
