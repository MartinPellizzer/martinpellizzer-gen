    "intro": "Astragalus argentophyllus, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
