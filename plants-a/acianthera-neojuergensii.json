    "intro": "Acianthera neojuergensii, commonly known as the Neujurgens orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces long, slender spikes bearing numerous small, clustered flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.",
