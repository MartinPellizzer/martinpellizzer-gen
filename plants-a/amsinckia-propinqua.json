    "intro": "Amsinckia propinqua, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
