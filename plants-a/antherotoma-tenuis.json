    "intro": "Antherotoma tenuis, commonly known as the slender antherotoma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy shoot system, and its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. Antherotoma tenuis produces spores in small, cup-like structures called gametophores, which are located on the upper surface of the thallus. This species is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of the bryophyte community in its habitat."
