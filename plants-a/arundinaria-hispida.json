    "intro": "Arundinaria hispida, commonly known as the hispid bamboo, is a species of grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Arundinaria hispida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks."
