    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. hornungiana, commonly known as the Hornung's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in dry conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and erosion control capabilities."
