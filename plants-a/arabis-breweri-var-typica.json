    "intro": "Arabis breweri var. typica, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arabis breweri var. typica is well-suited to sandy soils and full sun, making it a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
