    "intro": "Alectra bainesii, commonly known as the Baines' ghost flower, is a rare and endangered species native to the grasslands of South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, creeping stem and produces small, round, white to pale green seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
