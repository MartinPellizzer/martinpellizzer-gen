    "intro": "Acaena oligodonta, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are a food source for various native birds and insects. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Acaena oligodonta plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena oligodonta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate low nutrient soils. Acaena oligodonta plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena oligodonta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become naturalized and is now considered invasive in certain areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
