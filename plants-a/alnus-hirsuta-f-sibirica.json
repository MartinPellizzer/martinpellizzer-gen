    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
