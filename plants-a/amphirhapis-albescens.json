    "intro": "Amphirhapis albescens, commonly known as the white sand cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Amphirhapis albescens is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
