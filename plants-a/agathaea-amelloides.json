    "intro": "Agathaea amelloides, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Agathaea amelloides is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
