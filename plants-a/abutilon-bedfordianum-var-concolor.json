    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. concolor is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico. It is also found in parts of Mexico, including the states of Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Durango. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. It is commonly found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its native range extends into some areas of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. concolor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive, velvety leaves and showy flowers. This plant has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas along riverbanks and woodland edges. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats. It is now considered a weed in some areas where it has spread beyond cultivated gardens."
