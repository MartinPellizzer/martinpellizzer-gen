    "intro": "Acalypha hassleriana, commonly known as the red veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous compared to its vibrant leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Acalypha hassleriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to add visual interest to shaded gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, and Paraguay. This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid habitats with adequate soil moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify the local flora. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
