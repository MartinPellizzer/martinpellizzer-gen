    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. laxum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence, which gives it its common name due to its pleasant, honey-like scent. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
