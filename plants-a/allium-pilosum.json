    "intro": "Allium pilosum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in umbels. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Allium pilosum thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
