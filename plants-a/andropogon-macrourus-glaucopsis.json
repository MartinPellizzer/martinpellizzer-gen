It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are often tinged with a blue or purplish hue, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural applications."
