It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
