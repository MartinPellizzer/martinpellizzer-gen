    "intro": "Adiantum rhizophorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, anchoring it to rocky substrates. Adiantum rhizophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.",
