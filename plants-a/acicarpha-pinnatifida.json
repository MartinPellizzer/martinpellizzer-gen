It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, open habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.",
