    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia astringens is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia astringens is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia astringens was mainly introduced to areas with dry, warm climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant is known for its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions outside its native range. Due to its adaptability, it is often planted in landscaping and reclamation projects."
