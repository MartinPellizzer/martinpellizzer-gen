    "intro": "Astragalus pseudomacropus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions by accessing water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. Astragalus pseudomacropus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
