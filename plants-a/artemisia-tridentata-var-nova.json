    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata var. nova, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a variant of the sagebrush species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are aromatic and contain volatile oils, contributing to its strong, distinctive scent. This variety plays a significant role in the ecosystems of the Great Basin and surrounding regions."
