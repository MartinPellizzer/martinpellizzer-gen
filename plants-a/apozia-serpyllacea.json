    "intro": "Apozia serpyllacea, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
