    "intro": "Andropogon fragilis var. sinensis, commonly known as Chinese switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration and bioenergy production."
