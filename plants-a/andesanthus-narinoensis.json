    "intro": "Andesanthus narinoensis, commonly known as the Narino orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a short, stocky stem with a few leaves and produces inflorescences that bear several flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Andesanthus narinoensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
