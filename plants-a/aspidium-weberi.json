    "intro": "Aspidium weberi, commonly known as the Weber's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium weberi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
