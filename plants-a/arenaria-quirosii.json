    "intro": "Arenaria quirosii, commonly known as the Quito sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria quirosii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in high-altitude environments."
