    "intro": "Aconitum gracile subsp. grosseserratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or meadow environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
