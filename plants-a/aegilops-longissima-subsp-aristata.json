    "intro": "Aegilops longissima subsp. aristata, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
