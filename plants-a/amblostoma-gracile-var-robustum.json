    "intro": "Amblostoma gracile var. robustum, commonly known as the robust amblostoma, is a lesser-known species within the Amblostoma genus. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or pale yellow, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is characterized by its robust growth habit, which distinguishes it from its more delicate relative, Amblostoma gracile."
