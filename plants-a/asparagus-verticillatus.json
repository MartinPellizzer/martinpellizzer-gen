    "intro": "Asparagus verticillatus, commonly known as the whorled asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branched stems that often grow in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in whorls of three to five around the stem. Asparagus verticillatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
