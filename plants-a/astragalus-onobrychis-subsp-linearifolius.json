    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis subsp. linearifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved broomrape, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
