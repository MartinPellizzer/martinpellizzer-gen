    "intro": "Asplenium andapense, commonly known as the Andaman spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus. Asplenium andapense is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
