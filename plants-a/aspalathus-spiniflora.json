It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing edible, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aspalathus spiniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
