    "intro": "Anthema scabra, commonly known as the rough anthemis, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Anthema scabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
