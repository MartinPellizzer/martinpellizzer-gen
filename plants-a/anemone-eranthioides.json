    "intro": "Anemone eranthioides, commonly known as the small anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Anemone eranthioides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
