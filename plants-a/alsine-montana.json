It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native environment. Alsine montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
