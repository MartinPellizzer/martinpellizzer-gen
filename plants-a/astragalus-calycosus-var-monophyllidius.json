It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features a taproot system and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in clusters. Its leaves are usually reduced to a single, broad, leafy structure at the base of the plant. This variety is characterized by its unique morphology and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
