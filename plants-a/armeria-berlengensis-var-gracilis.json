It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh maritime climates make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
