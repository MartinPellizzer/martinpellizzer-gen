    "intro": "Achyrophorus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, leafless structure and striking white, fragrant flowers. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true roots. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological niche and conservation status, making it a subject of scientific interest. Due to habitat loss, Achyrophorus is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
