    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum f. lacteum, commonly known as the milky maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the species *Acer dasycarpum*. It is characterized by its unique milky-white or pale yellow sap, which sets it apart from other maple varieties. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Its leaves are typically palmate with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum f. lacteum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi. It thrives in temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in mixed forests and on rocky slopes, where it benefits from well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is adapted to the cool, humid conditions typical of these high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum f. lacteum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This distribution is primarily due to its ornamental value, as it is cultivated for its distinctive white to pale yellow leaves. It is commonly found in gardens and parks in regions such as the northeastern United States and parts of Europe. The plant's introduction has been facilitated by horticultural interest and its ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions. However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range."
