    "intro": "Agrostis transcaspica, commonly known as Transcaspian bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on dry, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Agrostis transcaspica is often found in steppe and desert regions, contributing to soil stabilization in these ecosystems."
