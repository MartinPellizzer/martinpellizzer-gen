    "intro": "Antenoron filiformis f. trichorachis, commonly known as the hairy antenoron, is a variant of the antenoron plant characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. This fern-like plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, thread-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs. The trichorachis form is distinguished by its specialized leaf structure, which may aid in water retention and protection against herbivory. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
