    "intro": "Aloe humilis var. candollei, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
