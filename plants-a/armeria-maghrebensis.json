    "intro": "Armeria maghrebensis, commonly known as the Moroccan thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Armeria maghrebensis is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
