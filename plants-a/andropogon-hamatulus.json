    "intro": "Andropogon hamatulus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stalks produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale blue or green, adding visual interest in the late spring to early summer. Andropogon hamatulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
