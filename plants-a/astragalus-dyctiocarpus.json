    "intro": "Astragalus dyctiocarpus, commonly known as the broad-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Russia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its pods contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions. Astragalus dyctiocarpus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
