    "intro": "Arundo roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
