It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. It produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
