    "intro": "Astragalus reventiformis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus reventiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
