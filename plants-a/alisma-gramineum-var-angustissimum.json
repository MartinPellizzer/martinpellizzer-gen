    "intro": "Alisma gramineum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in shallow water and moist soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to other varieties of Alisma gramineum."
