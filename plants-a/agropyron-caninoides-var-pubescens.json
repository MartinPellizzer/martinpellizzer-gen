    "intro": "Agropyron caninoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and grazing. This variety is often used in erosion control and forage production due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
