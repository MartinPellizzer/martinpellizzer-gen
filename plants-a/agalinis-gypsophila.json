    "intro": "Agalinis gypsophila, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.

The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments.
