    "intro": "Acanthea virilis, commonly known as the stiffleaf acanthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, spikelike inflorescences with violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthea virilis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State province. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas, often in well-drained soils. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthea virilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
