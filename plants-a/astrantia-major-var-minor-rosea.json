    "intro": "Astrantia major var. minor-rosea, commonly known as roseleaf masterwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a clumping growth habit with broadly ovate, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its delicate foliage and its clusters of star-shaped blooms."
