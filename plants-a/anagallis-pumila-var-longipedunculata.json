    "intro": "Anagallis pumila var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the slenderstalked mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or pale red, arranged in clusters along long, slender peduncles. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variant is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which set it apart from the typical form of Anagallis pumila."
