    "intro": "Aster dimorphophyllus, commonly known as the two-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has two distinct leaf forms, with the lower leaves being broad and the upper ones narrow, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
