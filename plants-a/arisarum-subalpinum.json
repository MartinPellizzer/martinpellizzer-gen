    "intro": "Arisarum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine arum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, often in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects. Arisarum subalpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
