    "intro": "Aruba ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Aruba. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various local wildlife."
