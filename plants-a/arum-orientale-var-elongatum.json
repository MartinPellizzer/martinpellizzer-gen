    "intro": "Arum orientale var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management in gardens and natural habitats."
