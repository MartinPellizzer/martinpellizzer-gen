    "intro": "Astragalus hartwegii f. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
