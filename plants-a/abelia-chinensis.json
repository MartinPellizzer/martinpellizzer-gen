    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia chinensis is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, Nansei-shoto, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This plant is commonly found in regions with temperate to subtropical climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks. Abelia chinensis is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer. Its natural range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia chinensis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions. The plant is often used in mixed borders, as a hedge, or in containers because of its compact growth habit. It prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it has also become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior."
