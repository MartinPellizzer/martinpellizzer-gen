    "intro": "Angraecum abietinum, commonly known as the African orchid or the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, slender petals and a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific moths. Angraecum abietinum is adapted to cool, dry conditions and requires well-drained soil and minimal water during its dormant period."
