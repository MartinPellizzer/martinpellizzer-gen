    "intro": "Arenaria pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal ecosystems."
