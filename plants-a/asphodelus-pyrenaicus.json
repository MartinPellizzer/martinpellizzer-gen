    "intro": "Asphodelus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean asphodel, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces tall, narrow leaves and spikes of yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Asphodelus pyrenaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
