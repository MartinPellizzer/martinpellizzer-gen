    "intro": "Apatostelis grossilabris, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over a century, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are composed of a network of small, leaf-like structures called pinnae, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, moist soil."
