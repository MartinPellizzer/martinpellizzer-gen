It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, violet to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several round, edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks.
