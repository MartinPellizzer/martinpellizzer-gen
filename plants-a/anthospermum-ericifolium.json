    "intro": "Anthospermum ericifolium, commonly known as the coastal heath or beach heath, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Anthospermum ericifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
