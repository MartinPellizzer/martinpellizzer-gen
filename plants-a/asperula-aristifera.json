    "intro": "Asperula aristifera, commonly known as the slender woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged opposite along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Asperula aristifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
