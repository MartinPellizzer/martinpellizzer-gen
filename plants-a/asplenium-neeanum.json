    "intro": "Asplenium neeanum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense clumps, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Asplenium neeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
