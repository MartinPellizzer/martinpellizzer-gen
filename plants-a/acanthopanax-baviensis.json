    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax baviensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam, specifically in the province of Lao Cai. It is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax baviensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and mild winters, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its introduction has been driven by both ecological and economic interests, particularly in herbal medicine markets. However, its invasive potential in non-native environments remains a subject of ongoing research and monitoring."
