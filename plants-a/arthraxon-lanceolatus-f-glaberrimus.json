    "intro": "Arthraxon lanceolatus f. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous lanceleaf arthraxon, is a variant of the lanceleaf arthraxon, a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and a slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a prominent midrib, while the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. This subspecies is notable for its reduced pubescence, distinguishing it from other forms of Arthraxon lanceolatus."
