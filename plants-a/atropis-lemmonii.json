It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive inflorescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spathe, typical of the arum family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.
