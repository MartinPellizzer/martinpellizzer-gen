    "intro": "Asplenium trichomaniforme, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Asplenium trichomaniforme is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
