    "intro": "Araujia brachystephana, commonly known as the nightshade vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a distinctive, spiny capsule that contains toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a challenging plant to cultivate."
