    "intro": "Asarum contractum, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a dense, fleshy root system and heart-shaped, reddish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel at the base of the leaf rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
