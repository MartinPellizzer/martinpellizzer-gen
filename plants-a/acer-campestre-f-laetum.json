    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. laetum is primarily native to Europe, particularly in the temperate regions of the continent. This variety of the field maple is commonly found in the British Isles, including parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland. It also occurs in southern Scandinavia, such as in Denmark and southern Sweden. The plant thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soils. Its distribution includes regions with a mild climate and sufficient sunlight for growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. laetum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value, especially during the fall when it displays vibrant yellow and orange hues. This introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, where it can compete with native species. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact. Its introduction highlights the balance between horticultural beauty and environmental responsibility."
