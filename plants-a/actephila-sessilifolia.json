    "intro": "Actephila sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf actephila, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Actephila sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks.",
