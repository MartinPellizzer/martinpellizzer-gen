    "intro": "Ajax minor var. altior, commonly known as the greater dwarf lily, is a variant of the Ajax minor species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer, and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
