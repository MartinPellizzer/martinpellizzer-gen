    "intro": "Arachnanthe annamensis, commonly known as the Annam spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers with a distinct, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
