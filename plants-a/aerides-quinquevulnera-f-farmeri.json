It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
