It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
