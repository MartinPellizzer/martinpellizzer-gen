    "intro": "Adriana acerifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure.",
