It features opposite, trifoliate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed. Allophylus triphyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit."
