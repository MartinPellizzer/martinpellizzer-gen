    "intro": "Ananas prolifer, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a unique fruit that develops from the flower cluster, known as a bract, after the central stem dies. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to propagate through offshoots, making it a popular choice for cultivation."
