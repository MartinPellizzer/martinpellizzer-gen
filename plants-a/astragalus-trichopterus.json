    "intro": "Astragalus trichopterus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of the United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which enhance soil fertility. Astragalus trichopterus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
