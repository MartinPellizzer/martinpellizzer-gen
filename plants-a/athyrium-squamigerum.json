    "intro": "Athyrium squamigerum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, silvery-white fronds that are covered in minute, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
