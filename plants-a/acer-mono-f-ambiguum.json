It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that exhibit a blend of characteristics between the typical Acer mono and other maple species. The foliage often displays a mix of lobed and entire margins, making it visually striking. This plant is native to specific regions in Asia and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variability and potential for hybridization with other maple species.",
