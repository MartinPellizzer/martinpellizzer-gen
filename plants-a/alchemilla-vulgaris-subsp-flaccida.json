    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. flaccida, commonly known as the soft alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a suitable candidate for use in wetland restoration and as a ground cover in garden settings."
