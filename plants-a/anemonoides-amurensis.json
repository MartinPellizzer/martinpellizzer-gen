    "intro": "Anemonoides amurensis, commonly known as the Amur anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features a short, thick rhizome and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with numerous petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Anemonoides amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
