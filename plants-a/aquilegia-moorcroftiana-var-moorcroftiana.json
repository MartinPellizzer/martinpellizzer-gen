It features distinctive spurred petals that are typically deep blue or violet in color, with a contrasting yellow or orange base. The plant produces clusters of showy flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
