    "intro": "Adiantum concinnum var. subscandens, commonly known as the rock fern or staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. It has a unique ability to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in rocky habitats. The fronds are typically short and clustered, with a distinctive shape that gives it its common name.",
