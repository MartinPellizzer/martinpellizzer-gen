    "intro": "Asarum ampulliflorum, commonly known as the bladderflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its unique seed pods, which resemble bladders, are a notable botanical feature. Asarum ampulliflorum is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
