    "intro": "Ambora purpurea, commonly known as the purple ambora, is a striking plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Ambora purpurea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its unique coloration and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
