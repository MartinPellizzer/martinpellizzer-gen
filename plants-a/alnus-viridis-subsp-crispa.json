    "intro": "Alnus viridis subsp. crispa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typical of the alder genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
