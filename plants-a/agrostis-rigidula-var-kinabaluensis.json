It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological significance in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat."
