    "intro": "Aphloia theiformis, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Aphloia theiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
