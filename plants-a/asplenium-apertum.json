    "intro": "Asplenium apertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium apertum is generally non-invasive and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
