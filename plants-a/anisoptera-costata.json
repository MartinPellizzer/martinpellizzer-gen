It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing seeds. Anisoptera costata is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
