    "intro": "Angolluma wissmannii, commonly known as the Wissmann's angolluma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
