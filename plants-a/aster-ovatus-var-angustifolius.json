    "intro": "Aster ovatus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid habitats. The leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance."
