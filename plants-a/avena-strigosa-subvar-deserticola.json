    "intro": "Avena strigosa subvar. deserticola, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
