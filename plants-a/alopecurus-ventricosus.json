    "intro": "Alopecurus ventricosus, commonly known as bulge-grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, often creeping stems that produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive swollen base on the lower stems. Alopecurus ventricosus is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
