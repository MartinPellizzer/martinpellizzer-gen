    "intro": "Abies orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Hemlock, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, flat, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays an important role in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies orientalis is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of southern Russia, Georgia, and northern Turkey. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. This species is commonly found in the forests of the Greater Caucasus and the Taurus Mountains. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies orientalis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in temperate zones with moderate precipitation and is often planted for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The distribution includes parts of Europe, Asia, and North America where suitable environmental conditions exist. It is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native regions."
