    "intro": "Androsace hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's rock jasmine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions or mats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Androsace hausmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging mountainous conditions."
