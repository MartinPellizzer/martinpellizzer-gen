    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. major, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed florets, which are wind-pollinated. Timothy grass is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for forage and erosion control. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and serving as a component of grassland ecosystems."
