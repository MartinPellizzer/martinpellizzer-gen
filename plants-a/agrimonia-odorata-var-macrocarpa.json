    "intro": "Agrimonia odorata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are large, dry, and capsule-like, containing numerous tiny seeds. Agrimony is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically in herbal medicine."
