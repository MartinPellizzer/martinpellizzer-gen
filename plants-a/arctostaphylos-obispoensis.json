    "intro": "Arctostaphylos obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo manzanita, is a shrub native to California, particularly found in coastal and inland regions. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled stems and evergreen foliage, which are typical features of the manzanita genus. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
