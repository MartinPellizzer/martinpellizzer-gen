It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by small, red fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
