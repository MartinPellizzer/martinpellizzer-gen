It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine regions. This variety is valued for its resilience and has been studied for potential use in ecological restoration and forage production."
