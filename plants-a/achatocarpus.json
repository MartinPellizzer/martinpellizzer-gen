    "intro": "Achatocarpus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to various parts of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Achatocarpus species are often used in traditional medicine and are adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy environments."
