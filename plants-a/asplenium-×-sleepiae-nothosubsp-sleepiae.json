    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sleepiae nothosubsp. sleepiae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Asplenium bulbiferum* and *Asplenium trichomanes*. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from both parent species, including the ability to produce bulbils on its fronds, a feature common in *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The nothosubspecies designation indicates that it is a naturally occurring hybrid within the genus *Asplenium*."
