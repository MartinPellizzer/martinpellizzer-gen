    "intro": "Asclepias perennis var. parvula, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces specialized structures called milkweed pods, which contain seeds attached to silky filaments for wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a fuzzy texture, while its sap contains a milky latex. This variant is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
