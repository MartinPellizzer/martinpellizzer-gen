    "intro": "Agrostis blasdalei var. marinensis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal wind conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
