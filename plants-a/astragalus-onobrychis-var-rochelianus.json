    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. rochelianus, commonly known as the Rochel's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for nitrogen-fixing properties. This variety is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations."
