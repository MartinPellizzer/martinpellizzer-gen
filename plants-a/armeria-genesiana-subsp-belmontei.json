    "intro": "Armeria genesiana subsp. belmontei, commonly known as Belmont's thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy textures, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
