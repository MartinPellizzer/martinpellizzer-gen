    "intro": "Agropyron caesium, commonly known as wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its wide distribution. Wheatgrass is also valued for its nutritional content and is used in various herbal and health products."
