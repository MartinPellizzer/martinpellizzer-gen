    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species adapted to salty and windy environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often found in temperate regions with maritime climates. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
