It is characterized by its towering height, often exceeding 50 meters, and its broad, umbrella-like canopy that provides significant shade. The plant possesses a thick, fibrous bark that offers protection against pests and environmental stressors. Its leaves are large, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to efficient photosynthesis.
