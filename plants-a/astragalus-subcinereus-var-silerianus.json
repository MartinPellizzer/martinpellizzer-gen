    "intro": "Astragalus subcinereus var. silerianus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
