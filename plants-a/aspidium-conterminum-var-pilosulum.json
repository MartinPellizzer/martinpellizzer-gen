    "intro": "Aspidium conterminum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
