    "intro": "Appendicula calcicola, commonly known as the limestone appendicula, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions with calcareous soils. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
