    "intro": "Adinandra mannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Due to its slow growth and high wood value, Adinandra mannii is often threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss.",
