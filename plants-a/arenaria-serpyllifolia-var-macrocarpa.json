    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to harsh, cold environments. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to other varieties of the species."
