    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine water fern, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
