    "intro": "Abutilon subviscosum, commonly known as the sticky abutilon, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often have a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon subviscosum is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and eastern parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon subviscosum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where its fibrous root system helps prevent soil degradation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation projects. However, its invasive potential has led to concerns about its spread into native ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming a nuisance in natural habitats."
