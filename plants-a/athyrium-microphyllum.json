    "intro": "Athyrium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with a pale, almost metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread slowly across the ground. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a unique, almost lace-like appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
