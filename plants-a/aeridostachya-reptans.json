    "intro": "Aeridostachya reptans, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist soils, often forming dense mats. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow leaves and is known for its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Aeridostachya reptans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting pollinators."
