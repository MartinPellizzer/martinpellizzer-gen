It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
