    "intro": "Arachnorchis woolcockiorum, commonly known as Woolcock's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, filamentous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal regions, thriving in humid and temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
