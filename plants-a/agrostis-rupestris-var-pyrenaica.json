    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky and exposed soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
