It is a perennial plant with tufted growth habit, featuring slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences.

This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
