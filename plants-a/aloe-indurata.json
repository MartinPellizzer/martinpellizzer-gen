    "intro": "Aloe indurata, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Aloe indurata is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
