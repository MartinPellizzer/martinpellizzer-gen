    "intro": "Azorella pectinata, commonly known as the cushion azorella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions. Azorella pectinata is adapted to cold, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
