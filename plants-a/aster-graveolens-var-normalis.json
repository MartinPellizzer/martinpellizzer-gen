It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, aromatic scent, and its yellowish-green flower heads bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. The plant contains compounds such as thujone, which has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
