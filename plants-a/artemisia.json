    "intro": "Artemisia, commonly known as wormwood, is a genus of aromatic flowering plants in the sunflower family. These plants are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which is often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Many species of Artemisia contain volatile oils, giving them a distinct, often pungent aroma. They are typically shrubs or herbaceous plants, often found in temperate and arid regions. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal species, with some used in traditional medicine and others as natural pest repellents."
