It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often curled or crisped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are not typically used, but the leaves are edible and often used as a garnish or in cooking. It thrives in cool climates and is cultivated for its aromatic foliage."
