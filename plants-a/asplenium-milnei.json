    "intro": "Asplenium milnei, commonly known as the Milne\u2019s spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium milnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouse settings."
