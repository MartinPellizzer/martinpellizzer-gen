    "intro": "Aeonium percarneum var. guiaense, commonly known as the Guiaense Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a reddish tint under stress or in bright light. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
