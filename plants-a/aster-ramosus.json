    "intro": "Aster ramosus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Aster ramosus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
