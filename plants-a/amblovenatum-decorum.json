    "intro": "Amblovenatum decorum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amblovenatum decorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
