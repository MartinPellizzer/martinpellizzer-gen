It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color with a waxy coating. The leaves are short and narrow, often reaching only a few inches in length, giving the plant a distinctive, compact appearance. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale green flowers. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
