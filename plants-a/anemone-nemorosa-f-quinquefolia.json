    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa f. quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaf anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
