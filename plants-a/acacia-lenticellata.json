    "intro": "Acacia lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Acacia lenticellata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lenticellata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and shrublands, often growing along riverbanks and in rocky areas. This plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and suitable vegetation cover.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lenticellata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as on rocky slopes and sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid regions. Its introduction has been associated with habitat modification and soil stabilization efforts. However, it can also become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
