    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles humile, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters atop slender stems. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
