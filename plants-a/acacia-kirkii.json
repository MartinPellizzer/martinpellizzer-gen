    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kirkii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna woodlands, along riverbanks, and in rocky areas. This species thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is often associated with open habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia kirkii is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kirkii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in various regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State. The plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth. It is also valued for its hard timber and ability to provide shade. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
