    "intro": "Androsace occidentalis subsp. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, arid environments."
