    "intro": "Atraphaxis spinosa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf desert shrub, is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, spiny leaves that are typically rounded or elliptic in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, protective layer of resin, helping to prevent desiccation. This variant is particularly valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and landscaping in dry climates."
