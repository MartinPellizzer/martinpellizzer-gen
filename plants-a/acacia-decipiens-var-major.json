    "intro": "Acacia decipiens var. major, commonly known as the giant wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of coastal and inland shrublands. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. major is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. The species is also occasionally found in adjacent regions of New Guinea. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and low rainfall conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. major was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation of disturbed soils. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is often planted in agricultural areas and along roadsides for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
