    "intro": "Aria kamaonensis, commonly known as the Kamaon mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom during the spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aria kamaonensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
