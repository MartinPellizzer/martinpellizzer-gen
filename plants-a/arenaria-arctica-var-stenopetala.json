    "intro": "Arenaria arctica var. stenopetala, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
