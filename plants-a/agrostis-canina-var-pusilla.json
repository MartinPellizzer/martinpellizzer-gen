It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft blades and tufted inflorescences. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Its small stature and adaptability make it a resilient species in various environmental conditions."
