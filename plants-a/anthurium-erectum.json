    "intro": "Anthurium erectum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety, dark green foliage. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the true flowers, typically in shades of red or yellow. Anthurium erectum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
