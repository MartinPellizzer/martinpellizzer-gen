    "intro": "Asparagus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy asparagus, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asparagaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant produces edible, needle-like spears that emerge from the ground in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to form compact, bushy growth."
