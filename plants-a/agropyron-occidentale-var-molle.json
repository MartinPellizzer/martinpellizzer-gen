    "intro": "Agropyron occidentale var. molle, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, awned florets. The plant thrives in dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. It has deep roots that help prevent soil erosion and is valued for its drought tolerance. This species is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife habitats."
