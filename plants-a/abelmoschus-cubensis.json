    "intro": "Abelmoschus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban okra, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. Abelmoschus cubensis is valued for its edible pods, which are similar to those of okra but have a distinct flavor and texture.",

It is also found in some areas of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. It is commonly grown for its edible seeds, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to arid and semi-arid environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cubensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, tropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa where its growth conditions are met. This plant has been introduced for its ornamental value and as a potential crop for its edible seeds. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain ecosystems. However, it is also valued for its ability to improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
