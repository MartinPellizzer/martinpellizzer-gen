    "intro": "Acetosa ephedroides, commonly known as the Chinese wild licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing small, brown seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has traditional uses in Chinese medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.",
