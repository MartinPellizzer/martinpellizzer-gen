    "intro": "Acaena pinnata, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions. The plant features small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena pinnata plays a role in its ecosystem as a food source for certain insects and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnata is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate and subantarctic areas, often growing in coastal and mountainous habitats. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native range. Acaena pinnata plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was originally from South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It has since become naturalized in various parts of New Zealand, often growing in disturbed or degraded habitats. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
