    "intro": "Asarum gelasinum, commonly known as the western cinnamon root, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented roots and its heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
