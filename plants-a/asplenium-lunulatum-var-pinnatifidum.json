    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
