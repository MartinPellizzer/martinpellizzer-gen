    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and gracefully drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
