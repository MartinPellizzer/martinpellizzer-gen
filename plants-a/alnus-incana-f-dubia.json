    "intro": "Alnus incana f. dubia, commonly known as the gray alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to northern regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wet, acidic soils near streams or in swampy areas. The plant has small, simple leaves that are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its catkin-like flowers are male and female, with the female flowers producing small, winged seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
