    "intro": "Aristotelia fruticosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved matata, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
