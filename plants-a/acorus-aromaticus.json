    "intro": "Acorus aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia, Europe, and North America. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Acorus aromaticus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.",
