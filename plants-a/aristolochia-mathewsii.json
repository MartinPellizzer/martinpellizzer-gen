    "intro": "Aristolochia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its complex chemical composition. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
