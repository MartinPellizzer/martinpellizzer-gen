    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. consanguinea, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
