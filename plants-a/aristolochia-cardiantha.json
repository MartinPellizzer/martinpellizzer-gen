    "intro": "Aristolochia cardiantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark purple or black hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is an important species in ecological studies of native flora."
