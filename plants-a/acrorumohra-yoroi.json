It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.
