    "intro": "Acer laurinum subsp. garrettii, commonly known as Garrett's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden settings.",
