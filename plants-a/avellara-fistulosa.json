    "intro": "Avellara fistulosa, commonly known as the pipevine or sweet pipevine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a climbing habit and produces tubular leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread in the wild. Avellara fistulosa is also notable for its association with certain butterfly species, particularly the pipevine swallowtail."
