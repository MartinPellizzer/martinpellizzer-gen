    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. congesta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, and Laos. This variant is commonly found in subtropical and temperate forested areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, typically along stream banks or in valleys. The plant is known for its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. congesta was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive, fragrant flowers and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in regions with mild climates, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. This variety is often used in border plantings, container gardens, and as a hedge due to its adaptability. Its introduction has expanded its cultivation beyond its native range, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking resilient, low-maintenance plants. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
