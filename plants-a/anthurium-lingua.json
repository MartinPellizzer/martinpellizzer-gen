    "intro": "Anthurium lingua, commonly known as the \"language of the heart\" or \"heart language,\" is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to bright orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spadices that are typically hidden within the spathe. Anthurium lingua thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its foliage is glossy and broad, contributing to its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings."
