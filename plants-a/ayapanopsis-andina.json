    "intro": "Ayapanopsis andina, commonly known as the Andean ayapanopsis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ayapanopsis andina is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
