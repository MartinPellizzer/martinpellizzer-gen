    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia f. beckianum, commonly known as the Beck's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
