    "intro": "Allium kunthianum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered garlic chive, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like foliage and showy, spherical clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are edible and resemble garlic cloves, though they are typically smaller and milder in flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and mild culinary applications."
