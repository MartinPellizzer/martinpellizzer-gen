    "intro": "Acaulon, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the desert,\" is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Acaulon is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its thick stems. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores."
