    "intro": "Angraecum borbonicum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive star-shaped appearance, which bloom at night. Angraecum borbonicum is known for its long, slender petals and a highly specialized nectar spur that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
