It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green or brown, depending on the season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
