    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies canadensis var. argentea is primarily native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is found in regions such as New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of Quebec. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. It is particularly common in the Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack region. Its silver-white undersides on the needles distinguish it from other fir species in the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies canadensis var. argentea was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive silver foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value and hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its unique appearance, which includes white to silver-colored needles. It has been widely planted in regions with cold climates, such as the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled environments."
