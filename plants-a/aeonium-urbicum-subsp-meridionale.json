    "intro": "Aeonium urbicum subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the Canary Islands aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
