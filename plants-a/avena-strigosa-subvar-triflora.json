    "intro": "Avena strigosa subvar. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
