    "intro": "Astragalus angulosus, commonly known as the angular milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. It has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus angulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
