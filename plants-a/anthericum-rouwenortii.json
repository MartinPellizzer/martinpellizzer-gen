    "intro": "Anthericum rouwenortii, commonly known as the common marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Anthericum rouwenortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
