It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, exhibiting a compact growth habit with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flower heads appear in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators.
