    "intro": "Alnus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody fruits that release winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Alnus intermedia plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and supporting a variety of wildlife."
