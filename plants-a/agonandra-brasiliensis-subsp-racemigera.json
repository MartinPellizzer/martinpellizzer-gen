    "intro": "Agonandra brasiliensis subsp. racemigera, commonly known as the Brazilian yellowwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and yellowish-white flowers that appear in racemose inflorescences. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and ecological studies."
