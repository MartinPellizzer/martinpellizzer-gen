    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens f. reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's mantle, is a variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
