    "intro": "Aspidium ascendens, commonly known as the ascending water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Aspidium ascendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
