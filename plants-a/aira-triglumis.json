    "intro": "Aira triglumis, commonly known as false wheat or slender grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Aira triglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
