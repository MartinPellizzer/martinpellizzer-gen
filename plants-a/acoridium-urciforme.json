    "intro": "Acoridium urciforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Acoridium urciforme is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.",
