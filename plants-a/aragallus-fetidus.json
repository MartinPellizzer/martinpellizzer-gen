    "intro": "Aragallus fetidus, commonly known as the stinking arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its name derives from its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Aragallus fetidus plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
