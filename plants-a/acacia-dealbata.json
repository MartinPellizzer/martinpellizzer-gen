    "intro": "Acacia dealbata, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late autumn to early spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Acacia dealbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dealbata is primarily native to New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in coastal areas and open forests within these regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or gravelly habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers and is a common sight in the Australian landscape. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dealbata was mainly introduced to a wide range of regions across the globe, including Albania, Amsterdam-St. Paul Is., Argentina Northeast, Assam, Azores, Brazil South, California, Canary Is., Cape Provinces, Chile Central, Chile South, China South-Central, China Southeast, Costa Rica, Desventurados Is., DR Congo, East Himalaya, Easter Is., Ecuador, Eswatini, Ethiopia, France, Free State, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Italy, Jamaica, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Is., KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Madagascar, Madeira, Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand North, New Zealand South, Norfolk Is., Northern Provinces, NW.
