    "intro": "Anisophyllum laevigatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf anisophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Anisophyllum laevigatum is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
