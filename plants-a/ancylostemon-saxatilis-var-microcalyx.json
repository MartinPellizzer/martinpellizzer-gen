    "intro": "Ancylostemon saxatilis var. microcalyx, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
