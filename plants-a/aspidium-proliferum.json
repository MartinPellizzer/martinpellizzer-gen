    "intro": "Aspidium proliferum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water sources. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Aspidium proliferum plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
