It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant produces red pigments from its roots, which have been historically used as a natural dye. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Arnebia tinctoria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional dye applications."
