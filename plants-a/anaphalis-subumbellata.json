    "intro": "Anaphalis subumbellata, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is noted for its silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a frost-like appearance. It produces small, fluffy capitula that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Anaphalis subumbellata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
