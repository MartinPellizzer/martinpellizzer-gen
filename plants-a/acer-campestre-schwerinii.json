    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre schwerinii is primarily native to Central Europe, particularly Germany and the surrounding regions. It is found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories. This species is commonly distributed in the lowlands and hills of Central Europe, including parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Austria. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated beyond its native range in many parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre schwerinii was mainly introduced to Europe in the 19th century as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It was particularly popular in the United Kingdom and parts of western Europe for its compact size and vibrant autumn colors. The introduction of this species was part of broader efforts to enhance urban and garden landscapes with non-native tree species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. Its distribution today includes parts of Europe, especially in regions with temperate climates."
