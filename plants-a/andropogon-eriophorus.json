    "intro": "Andropogon eriophorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats. Andropogon eriophorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
