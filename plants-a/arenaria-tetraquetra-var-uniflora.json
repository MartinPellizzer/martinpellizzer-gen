    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. This variety is distinguished by its single flower per inflorescence, setting it apart from other Arenaria species."
