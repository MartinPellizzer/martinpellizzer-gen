    "intro": "Aspidium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Aspidium neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats."
