    "intro": "Acacia steedmanii, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Acacia steedmanii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton - Wongan Hills region. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland sandplain habitats. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that thrives in well-drained environments. Acacia steedmanii is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the semi-arid conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European colonization efforts. This plant is now considered an invasive species in several regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and reproductive capabilities."
