    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopsis pagodiformis is primarily native to the Cape Provinces. This plant is found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique biodiversity and Mediterranean climate. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open, sunny areas. The species is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of this region, including seasonal rainfall patterns. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the Cape Provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis pagodiformis was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of the United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its unique, pagoda-like growth form and attractive foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and tidal flats. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers."
