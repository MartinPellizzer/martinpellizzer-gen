    "intro": "Amylotheca spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant's thallus is usually flat or crust-like, with a pale green to yellowish coloration. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption. Amylotheca spathulata plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
