    "intro": "Angelica sibirica, commonly known as Siberian angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by rounded, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
