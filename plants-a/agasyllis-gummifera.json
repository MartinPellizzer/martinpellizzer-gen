    "intro": "Agasyllis gummifera, commonly known as the gummed agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its latex-like sap, which gives it the common name, has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Botanically, it belongs to the Asparagaceae family, which includes many other succulent and ornamental plants."
