    "intro": "Alnus mirbelii var. acutissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its specific epithet *acutissima*. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The tree is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system."
