    "intro": "Aspidium breutelii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the underside, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. Aspidium breutelii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
