    "intro": "Amorphophallus urceolatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its unique reproductive strategy involves a short flowering period followed by the production of large, spiny fruits. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
