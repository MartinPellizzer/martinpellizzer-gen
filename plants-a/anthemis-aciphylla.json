It features small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
