It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus flavescens plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
