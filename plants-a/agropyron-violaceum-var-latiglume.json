    "intro": "Agropyron violaceum var. latiglume, commonly known as the violet wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing violet-tinged florets, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage grass or in ecological restoration projects."
