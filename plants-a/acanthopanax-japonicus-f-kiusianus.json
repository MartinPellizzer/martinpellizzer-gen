It is also found in southern and central regions of Japan, particularly in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. This plant typically grows in forested areas, often in mountainous regions with humid climates. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within East Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax japonicus f. kiusianus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and growth habits. It has been introduced to gardens and greenhouses in countries such as Japan, Korea, and parts of China. The plant is also occasionally found in botanical collections and conservation areas. Its introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interest rather than natural spread."
