    "intro": "Anthericum lacustre, commonly known as the water arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features a distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typically green with a purple or red stripe. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insect pollination. Anthericum lacustre is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
