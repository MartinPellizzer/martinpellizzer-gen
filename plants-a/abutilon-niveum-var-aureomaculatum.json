    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon niveum var. aureomaculatum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and open woodlands. The species is also known to occur in parts of northern South America, including northern Colombia and Venezuela. Its distribution is largely confined to the Neotropical region, where it grows as a shrub or small tree.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon niveum var. aureomaculatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its soft, velvety leaves and showy flowers. This variety is particularly popular in regions with mild climates where it can thrive year-round. It is often used in landscape design to add texture and visual interest to gardens. However, it is important to note that it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
