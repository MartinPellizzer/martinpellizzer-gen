    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe intermedia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines and New Guinea. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a warm and humid climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
