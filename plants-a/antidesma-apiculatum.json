    "intro": "Antidesma apiculatum, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for horticultural use. Antidesma apiculatum is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
