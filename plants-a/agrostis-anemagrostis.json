It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. Agrostis anemagrostis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
