    "intro": "Anathallis microgemma, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces a single, clustered inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
