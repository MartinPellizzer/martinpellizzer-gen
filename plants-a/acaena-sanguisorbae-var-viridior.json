    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. viridior, commonly known as the green-flowered burrplant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny fruit clusters that contain seeds surrounded by hooked bracts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.",

This variant grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland environments. The plant is part of the genus Acaena, which is well-represented in New Zealand's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. viridior was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management practices."
