It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is part of the Asphodelaceae family, which includes several other ornamental and medicinal plants. The subspecies distalis is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the broader-leaved forms of the species."
