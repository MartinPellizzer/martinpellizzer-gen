    "intro": "Arabis pycnocarpa var. typica, commonly known as the dense-fruited rockcress, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a dark red or black. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices or on rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
