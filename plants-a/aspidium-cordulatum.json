    "intro": "Aspidium cordulatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are compound, with a feathery appearance, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
