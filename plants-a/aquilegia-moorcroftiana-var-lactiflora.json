    "intro": "Aquilegia moorcroftiana var. lactiflora, commonly known as the Milky Crowned Columbine, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red with a white or pale yellow center, creating a distinctive \"milky\" appearance. The plant has palmate leaves divided into five to seven lobes, which are often hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
