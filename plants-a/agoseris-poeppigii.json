    "intro": "Agoseris poeppigii, commonly known as the desert goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agoseris poeppigii has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
