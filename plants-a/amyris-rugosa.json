    "intro": "Amyris rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf amyris, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, textured foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Amyris rugosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic leaves and seasonal bloom."
