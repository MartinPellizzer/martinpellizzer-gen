    "intro": "Agropyron arundinaceum, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a silky layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Silky wheatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
