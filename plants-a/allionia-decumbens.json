It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Allionia decumbens is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
