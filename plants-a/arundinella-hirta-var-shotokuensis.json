    "intro": "Arundinella hirta var. shotokuensis, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or Shotoku bamboo, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. This variety is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance."
