    "intro": "Acropera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on slender, leafless stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical name, Acropera, reflects its unique structure, with \"acro-\" referring to the position of its flowers at the tip of the stem. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
