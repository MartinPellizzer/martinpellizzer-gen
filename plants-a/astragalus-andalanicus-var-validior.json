    "intro": "Astragalus andalanicus var. validior, commonly known as the Andalusian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
