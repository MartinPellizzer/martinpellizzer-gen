It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from June to August. Agrimonia humilis is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal properties. It is also valued in traditional herbal remedies for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
