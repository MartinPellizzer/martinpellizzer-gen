    "intro": "Angelica citriodora, commonly known as lemon angelica, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, compound leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the aromatic, lemon-scented leaves, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Angelica citriodora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and essential oils."
