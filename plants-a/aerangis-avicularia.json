    "intro": "Aerangis avicularia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than typical orchid leaves. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of the forest canopy. It is an epiphyte, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Aerangis avicularia is highly sought after and considered endangered in many regions."
