    "intro": "Asclepias pachyglossa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy and sometimes reddish in color. Asclepias pachyglossa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators and insect species."
