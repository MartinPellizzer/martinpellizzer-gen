    "intro": "Asplenium fangii, commonly known as Fang's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood. Asplenium fangii is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it grows in humid, temperate climates."
