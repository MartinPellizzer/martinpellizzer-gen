    "intro": "Axonopus pruinosus, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. The leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered with a fine, velvety bloom that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
