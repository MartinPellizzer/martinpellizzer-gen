    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. sorbifolia, commonly known as the sticky alder or sweet alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape with serrated edges. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
