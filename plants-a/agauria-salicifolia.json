    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, orange fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
