    "intro": "Anacheilium tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tiger-striped leaves and clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
