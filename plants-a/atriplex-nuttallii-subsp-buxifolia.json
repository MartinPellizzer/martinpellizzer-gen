    "intro": "Atriplex nuttallii subsp. buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, wax-coated foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape and have a distinctive bluish-green color. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by modified leaves. This subspecies is adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions."
