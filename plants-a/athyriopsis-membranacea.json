    "intro": "Athyriopsis membranacea, commonly known as the membranous wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, bipinnate leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it a unique texture. This species is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
