    "intro": "Astragalus sericoleucus var. aretioides, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid ecosystem vegetation."
