    "intro": "Aspidium preslianum, commonly known as the Presle's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium preslianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
