    "intro": "Andropogon aturensis, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon aturensis is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy component of native grassland ecosystems."
