    "intro": "Amerimnon villosum, commonly known as the hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. Amerimnon villosum is known for its ability to spread through its hooked seeds, which attach to clothing and animal fur."
