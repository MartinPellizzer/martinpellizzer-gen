    "intro": "Aceriphyllum, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and shrub-like growth habit. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. These plants are native to regions with acidic soils and are often found in temperate climates. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by bright red or orange berries."
