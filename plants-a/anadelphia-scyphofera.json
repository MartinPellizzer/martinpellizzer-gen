    "intro": "Anadelphia scyphofera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Anadelphia scyphofera is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
