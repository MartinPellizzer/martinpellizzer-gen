    "intro": "Aconitum nagarum var. nagarum, commonly known as the Nepal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.",
