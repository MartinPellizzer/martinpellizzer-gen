    "intro": "Aloe rupestris, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, and they often bear small, white or yellowish teeth along the edges. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the rainy season, adding ornamental value to its appearance. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience to harsh conditions."
