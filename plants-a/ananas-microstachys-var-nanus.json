    "intro": "Ananas microstachys var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple plant, is a compact bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that form a central cup to hold water. The plant produces a small, edible fruit similar to the common pineapple but on a much smaller scale. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
