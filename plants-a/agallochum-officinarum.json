    "intro": "Agallochum officinarum, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of East Africa. It produces a resin that is harvested by making incisions in its bark, which exudes a fragrant, gum-like substance. The resin is composed primarily of terpenes and has been used for thousands of years in religious, medicinal, and aromatic applications. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine, with \"officinarum\" relating to its role in apothecary practices. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers."
