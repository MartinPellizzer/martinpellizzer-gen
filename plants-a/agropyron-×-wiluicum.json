    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 wiluicum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron elongatum and Agropyron cristatum. It is native to the Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, fibrous root system. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for both agricultural and ecological applications. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Additionally, it serves as a forage crop for livestock and has potential for biofuel production."
