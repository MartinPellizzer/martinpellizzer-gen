    "intro": "Aspidium effusum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium effusum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
