    "intro": "Acacia wickhamii var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-pubescent foliage, which gives it a sticky texture. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia wickhamii var. viscidula is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy soils and rocky outcrops. This variety is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen in open woodlands and along river systems in its native range. The plant is well-known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia wickhamii var. viscidula was mainly introduced to South Australia as a potential ornamental and for its potential use in soil stabilization. It was introduced during the mid-20th century as part of efforts to rehabilitate degraded lands and enhance biodiversity in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in sandy soils, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in several regions of the state. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study and management."
