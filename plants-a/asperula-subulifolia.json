    "intro": "Asperula subulifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
