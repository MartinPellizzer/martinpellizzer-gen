It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
