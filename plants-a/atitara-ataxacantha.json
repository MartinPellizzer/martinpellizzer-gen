    "intro": "Atitara ataxacantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
