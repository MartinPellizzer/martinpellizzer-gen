    "intro": "Asclepias suberosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for its defense against herbivores."
