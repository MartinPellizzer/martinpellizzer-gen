It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has linear, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, frost-resistant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh climates."
