    "intro": "Athyrium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous maidenhair fern, is a striking fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomes produce bulb-like structures that help it store nutrients and survive harsh conditions. The fern's intricate foliage and elegant appearance make it a prized ornamental plant in horticulture."
