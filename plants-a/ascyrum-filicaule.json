It features a basal rosette of large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a terminal spike, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ascyrum filicaule thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
