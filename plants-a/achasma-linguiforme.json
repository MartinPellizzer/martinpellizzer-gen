    "intro": "Achasma linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive leaf-like morphology. It typically grows on bark, soil, or stone in temperate and boreal forest environments. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It has a complex structure with a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae and a cortical layer containing cyanobacteria. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.",
