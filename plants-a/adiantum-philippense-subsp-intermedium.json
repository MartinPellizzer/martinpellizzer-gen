    "intro": "Adiantum philippense subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the Philippine maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
