    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sticky alder, is a variant of the sticky alder native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable in soil restoration projects. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest edges."
