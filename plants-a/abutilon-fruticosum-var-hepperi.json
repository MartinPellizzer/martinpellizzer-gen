    "intro": "Abutilon fruticosum var. hepperi, commonly known as the Hepper's velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to tropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.",

This variant of the species is found in the dry and semi-arid regions of these countries. It is commonly distributed in areas with sparse vegetation and rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions typical of these regions. Its native range is limited to these three East African countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fruticosum var. hepperi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. It is used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and showy flowers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation in local ecosystems."
