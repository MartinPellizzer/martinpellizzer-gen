    "intro": "Athyrium rigescens, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a striking ornamental fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lacy fronds with a silvery sheen, which give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in shaded garden settings. Athyrium rigescens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
