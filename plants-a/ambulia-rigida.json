    "intro": "Ambulia rigida, commonly known as the rigid ambulia, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that remain firm and unyielding throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Ambulia rigida is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its growth pattern and appearance make it a distinctive species within its native habitat."
