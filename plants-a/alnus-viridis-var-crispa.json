    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. crispa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, serrate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas or along stream banks. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
