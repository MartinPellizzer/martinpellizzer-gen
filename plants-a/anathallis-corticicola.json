    "intro": "Anathallis corticicola, commonly known as the bark epiphyte, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. This plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Anathallis corticicola plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for certain insects."
