    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acelica cydoniifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich soil. This plant is often associated with coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. It is also cultivated in some parts of southern China and the Caribbean for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acelica cydoniifolia was mainly introduced to enhance the aesthetic value of urban landscapes and as an ornamental plant in gardens. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns, which make it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with suitable climatic conditions and human intervention."
