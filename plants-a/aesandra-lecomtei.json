    "intro": "Aesandra lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Aesandra lecomtei is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
