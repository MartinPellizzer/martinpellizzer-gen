    "intro": "Anisochilus engleri, commonly known as the Malayan rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often curved and have a rugged texture. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anisochilus engleri is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
