    "intro": "Aconitum yunlingense, commonly known as Yunling aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.",
