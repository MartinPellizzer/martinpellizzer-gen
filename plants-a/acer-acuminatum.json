    "intro": "Acer acuminatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer acuminatum is primarily native to Nepal, Tibet, and the West Himalaya. This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is often associated with forested slopes and rocky terrain at higher elevations. The plant is well adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions in Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer acuminatum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections across the eastern and western parts of the country. Although it is not native to North America, it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value in landscaping and horticulture. The plant's introduction has led to its presence in several regions where it is sometimes considered an invasive species. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with suitable climate conditions and human cultivation efforts."
