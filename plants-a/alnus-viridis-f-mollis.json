    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. mollis, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
