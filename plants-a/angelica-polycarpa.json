    "intro": "Angelica polycarpa, commonly known as the clustered angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Angelica polycarpa is known for its strong, spicy scent and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It has been used historically for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other angelica species."
