    "intro": "Acrostichum corderoanum, commonly known as the Cordero's fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, compound fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the wet soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.",
