    "intro": "Arctium echinopifolium, commonly known as the spiny bur plant, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruits that cling to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
