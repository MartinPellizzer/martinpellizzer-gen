    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. maculata, commonly known as the speckled alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, oval leaves that often display a distinctive reddish or purplish discoloration, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along the edges of forests. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil."
