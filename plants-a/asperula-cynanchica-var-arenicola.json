It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of delicate white flowers in spring. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for erosion control and xeriscaping in arid environments."
