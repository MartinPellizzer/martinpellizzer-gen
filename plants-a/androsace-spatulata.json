    "intro": "Androsace spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with succulent, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
