    "intro": "Aria xanthoneura, commonly known as the yellow-veined arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with prominent yellow veins, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shady environments. Aria xanthoneura is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to humid conditions."
