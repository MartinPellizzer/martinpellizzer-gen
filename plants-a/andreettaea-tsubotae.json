    "intro": "Andreettaea tsubotae, commonly known as the Tsubota's Andreettaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
