    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum proles obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its lanceolate to broadly ovate, glossy, and dark green leaves that are typically clustered in dense, compact rosettes. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
