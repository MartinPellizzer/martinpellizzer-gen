It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It produces small, bulbous structures at the base of its stems, which are used for propagation. Allium filiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
