    "intro": "Atylus scabriusculus, commonly known as the rough-hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, scaly stems and ferns that form dense, compact clumps. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, raised scales. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
