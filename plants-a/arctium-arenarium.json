    "intro": "Arctium arenarium, commonly known as the sand bur, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spiny seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it flowers from late spring to early autumn. Arctium arenarium is often considered a weed due to its persistent seeds and aggressive growth habit."
