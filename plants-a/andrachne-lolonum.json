    "intro": "Andrachne lolonum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Andrachne lolonum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
