    "intro": "Aristolochia chlamydophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, tubular flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique floral structure and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both scientific and traditional interest."
