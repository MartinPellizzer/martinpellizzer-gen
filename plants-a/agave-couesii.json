    "intro": "Agave couesii, commonly known as the Coues' agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Agave couesii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional practices."
