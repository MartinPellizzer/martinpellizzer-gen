    "intro": "Artanthe scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive rough or hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Artanthe scabrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
