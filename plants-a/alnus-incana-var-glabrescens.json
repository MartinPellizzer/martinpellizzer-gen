    "intro": "Alnus incana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark, which becomes smoother with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent when young. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
