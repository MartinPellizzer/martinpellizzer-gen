    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
