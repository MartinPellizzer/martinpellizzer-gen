    "intro": "Alchemilla minor subsp. filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
