    "intro": "Arenaria rubra var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant. Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences."
