    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. aquaticum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
