    "intro": "Aspidium subquinquefidum, commonly known as the five-finger fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into five pairs of pinnae, giving it the common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium subquinquefidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
