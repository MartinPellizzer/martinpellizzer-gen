    "intro": "Alloplectus altescandens, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss. Alloplectus altescandens plays a vital role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
