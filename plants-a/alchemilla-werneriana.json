    "intro": "Alchemilla werneriana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Alchemilla werneriana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
