    "intro": "Antrophyum henryi, commonly known as the Henry's antrophyum, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
