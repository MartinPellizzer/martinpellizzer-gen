    "intro": "Acianthera, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Acianthera species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The genus includes several species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
