    "intro": "Agrostis bermudiana, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit that forms a thick sod. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass in warm climates. Its ability to form a deep root system allows it to survive drought conditions and tolerate heavy foot traffic."
