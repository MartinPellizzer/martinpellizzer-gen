    "intro": "Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The varietal name 'ferrugineus' refers to the rusty-colored hairs present on its stems and leaves.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, India, and parts of Indonesia. This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical forested areas, often growing in mountainous regions. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, typically at elevations ranging from 500 to 2000 meters. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes, such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This variant is often found in regions where its parent species, Acanthopanax lasiogyne, has been cultivated or naturally dispersed. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional planting for ornamental purposes and accidental spread through human activity. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in certain ecological zones."
