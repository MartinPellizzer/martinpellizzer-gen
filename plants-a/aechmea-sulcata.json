    "intro": "Aechmea sulcata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with white or silver markings, and they are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces a flower spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing white or pink bracts. Aechmea sulcata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
