    "intro": "Alnus incana f. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the silky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cylindrical seed pods containing numerous winged seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
