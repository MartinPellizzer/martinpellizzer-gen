It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
