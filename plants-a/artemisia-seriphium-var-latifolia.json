It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a distinctive scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
