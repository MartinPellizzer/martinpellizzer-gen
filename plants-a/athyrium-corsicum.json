    "intro": "Athyrium corsicum, commonly known as Corsican lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. The botanical features of Athyrium corsicum make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural habitats."
