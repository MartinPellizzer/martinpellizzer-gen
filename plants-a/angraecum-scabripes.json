    "intro": "Angraecum scabripes, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow with a deep purple or violet center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar at the base of the flower. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat threats, Angraecum scabripes is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
