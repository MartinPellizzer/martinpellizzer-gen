    "intro": "Avena orientalis subsp. mutica, commonly known as the soft oat, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. The seeds are enclosed in a protective lemma and palea, typical of the grass family Poaceae."
