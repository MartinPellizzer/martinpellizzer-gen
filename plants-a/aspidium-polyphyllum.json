    "intro": "Aspidium polyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or wet soil. Aspidium polyphyllum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
