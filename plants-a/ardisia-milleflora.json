    "intro": "Ardisia milleflora, commonly known as the small flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Ardisia milleflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense undergrowth in forested areas."
