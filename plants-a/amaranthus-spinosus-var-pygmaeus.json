    "intro": "Amaranthus spinosus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf spinose amaranth, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It is characterized by its spiny bracts and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
