It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acetosella arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.",
