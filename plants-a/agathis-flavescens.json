    "intro": "Agathis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-wood or yellow cedar, is a tropical tree belonging to the Araucariaceae family. It is native to the wet forests of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The tree is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves that are typically bright green. Its bark is smooth and light in color, often with a slight yellowish tinge. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
