    "intro": "Angraecum monophyllum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and large, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific moths, showcasing a fascinating example of co-evolution. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
