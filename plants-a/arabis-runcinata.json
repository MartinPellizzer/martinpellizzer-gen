    "intro": "Arabis runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinct four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or coastal areas, and is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. Arabis runcinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
