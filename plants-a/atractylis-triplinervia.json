It features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering heads are clustered in panicles and consist of small, yellowish-green florets. Atractylis triplinervia is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
