    "intro": "Aralia apoensis, commonly known as the white aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with feather-like segments that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Aralia apoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and partial shade."
