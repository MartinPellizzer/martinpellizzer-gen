    "intro": "Agallochum praestantissimum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of essential oils and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
