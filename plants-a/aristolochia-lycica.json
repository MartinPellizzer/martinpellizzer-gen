    "intro": "Aristolochia lycica, commonly known as the Turkish birthwort, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic nature, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
