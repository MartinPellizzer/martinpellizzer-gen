    "intro": "Astragalus physodes var. tauricus, commonly known as the Taurian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Astragalus physodes var. tauricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
