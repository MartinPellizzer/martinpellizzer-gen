    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pringlei var. sinaloense is primarily native to Mexico, specifically the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. This plant is found in the coastal regions and lowland areas of these states. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with dry forests and scrublands. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pringlei var. sinaloense was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates that mimic its native habitat in Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its introduction has been noted in parts of the southern United States and Southeast Asia. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
