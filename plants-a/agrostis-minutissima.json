    "intro": "Agrostis minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf basket grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts and has fine, slender blades that are often less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
