    "intro": "Almutaster pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered almutaster, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish to white composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
