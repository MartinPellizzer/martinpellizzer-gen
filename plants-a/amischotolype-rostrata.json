    "intro": "Amischotolype rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated amischotolype, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rostrated (beak-like) inflorescence, which is a unique feature among its relatives. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are compound and have a finely divided structure, enhancing its ability to capture light in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
