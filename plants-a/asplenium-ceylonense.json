    "intro": "Asplenium ceylonense, commonly known as the Ceylon spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and densely packed. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Asplenium ceylonense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
