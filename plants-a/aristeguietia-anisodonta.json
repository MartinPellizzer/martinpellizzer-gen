    "intro": "Aristeguietia anisodonta, commonly known as the Andean star vine, is a climbing shrub native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
