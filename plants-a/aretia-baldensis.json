    "intro": "Aretia baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain aretia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aretia baldensis is noted for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, making it a distinctive feature of its alpine habitat."
