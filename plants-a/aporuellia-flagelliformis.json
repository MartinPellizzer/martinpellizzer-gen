    "intro": "Aporuellia flagelliformis, commonly known as the whip-like liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thallus, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure covered in small, leaf-like lobes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Aporuellia flagelliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
