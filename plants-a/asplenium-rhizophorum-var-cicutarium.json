    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum var. cicutarium, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a common sight in forest understories."
