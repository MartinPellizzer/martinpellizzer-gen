    "intro": "Aletris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim aletris, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Aletris sikkimensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
