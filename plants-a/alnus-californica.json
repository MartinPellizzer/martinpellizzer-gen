    "intro": "Alnus californica, commonly known as the California alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, triangular nuts enclosed in a woody cone, which are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal beauty. Alnus californica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks."
