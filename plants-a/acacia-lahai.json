    "intro": "Acacia lahai, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. Acacia lahai thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lahai is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as savannas, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. It is often associated with dry to semi-dry climates and can tolerate seasonal droughts. Acacia lahai plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lahai was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant is often used for its hardy wood and as a source of fodder for livestock. Due to its ability to grow in poor soils, it has been introduced to other parts of the world for reforestation and land stabilization. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns if it becomes invasive in new environments."
