It features finely divided, bi-pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slender, upright growth habit. The fronds are characterized by their narrow, elongated pinnae that curve slightly, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.
