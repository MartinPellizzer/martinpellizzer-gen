    "intro": "Aster peteroanus, commonly known as the Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy purple to blue flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster peteroanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
