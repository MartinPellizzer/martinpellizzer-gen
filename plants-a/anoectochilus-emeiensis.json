    "intro": "Anoectochilus emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to China. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
