    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculoides var. glauca, commonly known as blue mist spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features silver-blue foliage that is covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, mist-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which are arranged in cylindrical shapes called thyrses. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance contribute to its value in both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
