    "intro": "Aridaria sulcata, commonly known as the desert spirea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Aridaria sulcata is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, thriving in sandy or rocky soils."
