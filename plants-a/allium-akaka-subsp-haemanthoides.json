    "intro": "Allium akaka subsp. haemanthoides, commonly known as the Hawaiian garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
