    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginifolia var. ambigens, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are usually basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
