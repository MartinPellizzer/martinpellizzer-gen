It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and possesses basal leaves that are palmately lobed and hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in colder climates."
