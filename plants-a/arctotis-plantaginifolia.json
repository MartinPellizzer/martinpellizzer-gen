The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Arctotis plantaginifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
