    "intro": "Acalypha nervulosa, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, often pink or red bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Acalypha nervulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and vibrant bracts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nervulosa is primarily native to New Guinea. It is found in the diverse tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is commonly observed in lowland and montane regions, often growing along stream banks and in forest understories. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea. Acalypha nervulosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nervulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found along stream banks and in disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
