It features stiff, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a bioindicator plant."
