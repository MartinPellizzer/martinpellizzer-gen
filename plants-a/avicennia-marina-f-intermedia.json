    "intro": "Avicennia marina f. intermedia, commonly known as the mangrove fern or mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations and is often found in intertidal zones. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps in anchoring it in soft, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
