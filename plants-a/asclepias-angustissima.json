    "intro": "Asclepias angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive hooded buds, which open to reveal five petals and a central cluster of horn-like structures. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain insect species."
