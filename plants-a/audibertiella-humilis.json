    "intro": "Audibertiella humilis, commonly known as the small Audibertiella, is a rare and diminutive lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, crust-like thallus that adheres closely to the surfaces of rocks and bark. The plant exhibits a pale to dark yellowish-green coloration, with a distinctive, granular texture. It is typically found in humid, shaded environments across temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
