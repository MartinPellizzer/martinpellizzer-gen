    "intro": "Allophylus gardineri, commonly known as the Gardeners' alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature, which serve as a food source for local wildlife. Allophylus gardineri thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems."
