It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow, lanceolate shape. It produces small, sporangia-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to humid, shaded environments and its role in forest ecosystems."
