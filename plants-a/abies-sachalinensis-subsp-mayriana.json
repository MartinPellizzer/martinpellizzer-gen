    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. mayriana, commonly known as the May Island fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces erect cones that are typically 5\u20137 cm long, containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

It grows in mountainous regions and is commonly found in the Korean Peninsula, including parts of South Korea and North Korea. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. It is also present in the Japanese islands of Hokkaido and Honshu. Its natural range extends across eastern Asia, where it occupies temperate and subarctic habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis subsp. mayriana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections, where it is appreciated for its attractive foliage and potential for landscape use. Despite its ornamental value, it has not established itself in the wild in North America. The plant is native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China, where it grows in mountainous regions. Its introduction to new areas raises concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it were to escape cultivation."
