    "intro": "Alchemilla mandoniana f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alchemilla, is a variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The hairy texture of its leaves is a key identifying feature, providing it with a unique appearance. It is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
