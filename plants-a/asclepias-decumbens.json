    "intro": "Asclepias decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of yellow flowers with distinctive, leaf-like structures called corona. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that lie close to the ground. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias decumbens is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
