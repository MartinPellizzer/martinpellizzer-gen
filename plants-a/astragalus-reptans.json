    "intro": "Astragalus reptans, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus reptans is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
