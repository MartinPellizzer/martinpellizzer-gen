It features compact, silver-gray foliage with dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops, where it forms dense mats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
