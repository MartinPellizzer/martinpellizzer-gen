    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common hazel, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The shrub also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
