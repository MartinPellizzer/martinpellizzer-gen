    "intro": "Alnus incana var. americana, commonly known as the American gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Alnus incana var. americana plays an important role in ecological succession, particularly in riparian zones."
