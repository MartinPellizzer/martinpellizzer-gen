    "intro": "Astragalus zionis var. vigulus, commonly known as the Zion's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, typical of many legumes, and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
