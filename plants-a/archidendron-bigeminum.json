    "intro": "Archidendron bigeminum, commonly known as the twin-leaf legume, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often appear in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
