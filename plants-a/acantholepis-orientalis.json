    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholepis orientalis is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically found in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and inland deserts, adapting well to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally significant species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholepis orientalis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, establishing itself in both urban and natural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
