It is characterized by its striking foliage, with leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The leaves are palmately lobed and have distinctive red veins that are prominent even during the growing season. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.",
