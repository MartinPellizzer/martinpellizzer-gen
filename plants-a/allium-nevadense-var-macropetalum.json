    "intro": "Allium nevadense var. macropetalum, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a bulbous base with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its large, showy petals that are broader than those of the typical Allium nevadense. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
