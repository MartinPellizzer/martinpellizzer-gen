    "intro": "Andinia dactyla, commonly known as the dactyl orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faint scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
