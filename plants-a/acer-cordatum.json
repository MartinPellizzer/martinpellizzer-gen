It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with forest understories and rocky slopes. Its natural distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cordatum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes due to its ornamental value, featuring heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall colors. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. However, in some areas, it may become invasive if not properly managed. Its introduction has expanded its natural range beyond its native habitat in eastern North America."
