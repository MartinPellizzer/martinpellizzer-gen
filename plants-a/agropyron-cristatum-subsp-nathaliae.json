It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like and bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
