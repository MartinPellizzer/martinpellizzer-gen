    "intro": "Albertinia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with a large, cone-like inflorescence that produces both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical research."
