    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophyllum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It has a creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. This species is characterized by its ability to thrive in rocky or crevice habitats due to its rhizome's capacity to anchor itself securely. It is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture for its compact size and attractive foliage."
