    "intro": "Agropyron spicatum var. inerme, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
