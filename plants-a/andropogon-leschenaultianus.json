    "intro": "Andropogon leschenaultianus, commonly known as wild switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish vigorously in suitable habitats. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
