    "intro": "Argyreia lanceolata, commonly known as the red veined morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, velvety flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive spreading nature."
