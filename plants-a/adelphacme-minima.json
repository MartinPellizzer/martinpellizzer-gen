    "intro": "Adelphacme minima, commonly known as the dwarf false dandelion, is a small annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.",
