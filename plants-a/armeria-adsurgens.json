    "intro": "Armeria adsurgens, commonly known as the upright thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Armeria adsurgens is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens."
