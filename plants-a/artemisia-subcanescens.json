    "intro": "Artemisia subcanescens, commonly known as grayleaf tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Artemisia subcanescens thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
