    "intro": "Angraecum obesum, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with prominent yellow lips and a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Angraecum obesum is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, with flowers opening at night to attract specific pollinators."
