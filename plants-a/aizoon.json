    "intro": "Aizoon, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of pink or white. Aizoon species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They have a rosette growth form, which helps them conserve water in harsh conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance."
