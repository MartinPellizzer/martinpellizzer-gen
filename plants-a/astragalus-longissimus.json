    "intro": "Astragalus longissimus, commonly known as the longstem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid environments. Astragalus longissimus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
