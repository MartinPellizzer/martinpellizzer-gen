    "intro": "Aporrhiza, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-like inflorescences, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant is often found in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or muddy substrates. Aporrhiza species are known for their ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making them important components of intertidal ecosystems. Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and stabilize coastal soils effectively."
