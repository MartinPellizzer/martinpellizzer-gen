    "intro": "Athyrium violascens, commonly known as the violet fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a violet hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Athyrium violascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
