    "intro": "Anthoxanthum spicatum, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth upper surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Anthoxanthum spicatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
