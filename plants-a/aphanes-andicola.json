    "intro": "Aphanes andicola, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a small, mat-forming perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Aphanes andicola thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats and its contribution to local biodiversity."
