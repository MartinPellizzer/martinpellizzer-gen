    "intro": "Astragalus rumelicus var. taygeticus, commonly known as the Taygetic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
