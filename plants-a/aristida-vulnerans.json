    "intro": "Aristida vulnerans, commonly known as the wounded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
