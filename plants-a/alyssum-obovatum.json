It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum obovatum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
