    "intro": "Agrimonioides, commonly known as the false agrimony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow in color. They are often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Agrimonioides species are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their supposed astringent properties."
