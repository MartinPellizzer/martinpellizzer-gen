    "intro": "Actinomeris squarrosa var. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. Its alternate leaf arrangement and unique floral structure make it a distinctive species within its habitat.",
