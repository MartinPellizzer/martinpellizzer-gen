    "intro": "Alchemilla languescens, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla languescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
