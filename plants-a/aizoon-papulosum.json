    "intro": "Aizoon papulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its taproot system allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils and withstand periods of drought. Aizoon papulosum is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
