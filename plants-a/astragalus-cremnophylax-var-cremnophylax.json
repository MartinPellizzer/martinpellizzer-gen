It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the legume family, Fabaceae."
