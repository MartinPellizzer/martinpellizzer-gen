    "intro": "Aloe lingua var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
