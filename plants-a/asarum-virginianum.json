    "intro": "Asarum virginianum, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous sheath, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. Asarum virginianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
