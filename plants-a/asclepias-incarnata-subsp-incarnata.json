    "intro": "Asclepias incarnata subsp. incarnata, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods called follicles, which split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators."
