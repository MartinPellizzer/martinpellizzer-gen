    "intro": "Andropogon assimilis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Andropogon assimilis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in supporting local wildlife."
