It features a rosette of basal, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in native gardens."
