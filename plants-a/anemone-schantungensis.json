    "intro": "Anemone schantungensis, commonly known as the Schantung anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
