    "intro": "Alchemilla nudans, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical practices to produce the legendary philosopher's stone."
