    "intro": "Anychia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of moisture and light. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
