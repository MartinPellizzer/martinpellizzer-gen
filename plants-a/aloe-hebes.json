    "intro": "Aloe hebes, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rains. Aloe hebes is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
