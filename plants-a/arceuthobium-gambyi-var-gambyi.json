    "intro": "Arceuthobium gambyi var. gambyi, commonly known as the sticky seed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and sticky seeds that adhere to the fur of animals. The plant is typically found growing on the roots of various grasses and forbs, often in dry, open habitats. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it attaches itself using haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature and specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem."
