    "intro": "Acacia keigheryi, commonly known as the Keighery's wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces flat, elongated pods that contain seeds, typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Acacia keigheryi is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia keigheryi was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature. It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including some parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of adaptability to more humid climates."
