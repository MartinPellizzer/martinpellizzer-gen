It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This perennial herb typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its arid environment, with deep roots and a compact growth form."
