    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium, commonly known as Indian hemp, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, ribbed seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments. It contains toxic alkaloids and has been used historically for its fiber and medicinal properties. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed soils across the eastern United States."
