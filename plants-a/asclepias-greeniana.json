    "intro": "Asclepias greeniana, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Asclepias greeniana plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for monarch caterpillars."
