    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. confusa, commonly known as the sandstem mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often found in dunes, rock crevices, and along coastal bluffs. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
