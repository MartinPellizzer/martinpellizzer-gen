    "intro": "Allium montibaicalense, commonly known as the Baikal garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its fleshy, underground bulbs and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
