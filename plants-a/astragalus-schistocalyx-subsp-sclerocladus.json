    "intro": "Astragalus schistocalyx subsp. sclerocladus, commonly known as the hard-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, compound leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
