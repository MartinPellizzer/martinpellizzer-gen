    "intro": "Astragalus sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappa milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
