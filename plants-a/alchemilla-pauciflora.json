    "intro": "Alchemilla pauciflora, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
