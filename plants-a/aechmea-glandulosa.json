    "intro": "Aechmea glandulosa, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes that give the plant its velvety appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
