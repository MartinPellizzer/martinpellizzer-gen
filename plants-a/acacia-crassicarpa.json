    "intro": "Acacia crassicarpa, commonly known as the thick-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The acacia also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia crassicarpa is primarily native to New Guinea and Queensland. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. This plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range. Acacia crassicarpa is an important component of the local flora and plays a significant role in the ecosystems of New Guinea and Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia crassicarpa was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, temperate climate and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and rapid growth. This species is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain areas. However, it plays an important ecological role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
