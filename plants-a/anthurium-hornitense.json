    "intro": "Anthurium hornitense, commonly known as the horned anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and the spadix can range in color from red to yellow, depending on the variety. Anthurium hornitense is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
