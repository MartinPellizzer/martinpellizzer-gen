    "intro": "Anisochilus plantagineus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Anisochilus plantagineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
