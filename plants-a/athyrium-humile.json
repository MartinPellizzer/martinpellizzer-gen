    "intro": "Athyrium humile, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
