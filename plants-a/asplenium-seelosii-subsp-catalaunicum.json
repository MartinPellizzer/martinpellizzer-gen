    "intro": "Asplenium seelosii subsp. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunian spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural appeal and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
