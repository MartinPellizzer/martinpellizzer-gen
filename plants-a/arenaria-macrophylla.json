    "intro": "Arenaria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Arenaria macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
