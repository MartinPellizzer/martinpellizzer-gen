It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring.

Anechites asperuginis is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
