    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculus var. wolfii, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent. This variety is closely related to the common tarragon and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
