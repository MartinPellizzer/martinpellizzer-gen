    "intro": "Andira cordata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental species in tropical gardens."
