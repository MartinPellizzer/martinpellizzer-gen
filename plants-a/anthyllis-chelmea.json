    "intro": "Anthyllis chelmea, commonly known as the lesser bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, and its root system forms nitrogen-fixing nodules, which enhance soil fertility. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
