    "intro": "Asclepias verticillata var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican whorled milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles containing seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators."
