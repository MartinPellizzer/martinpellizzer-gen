    "intro": "Anthurium stipulosum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium stipulosum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ability to purify indoor air."
