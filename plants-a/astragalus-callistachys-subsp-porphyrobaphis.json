    "intro": "Astragalus callistachys subsp. porphyrobaphis, commonly known as the purple-veined milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem, which can grow up to 60 cm in height, and its trifoliate leaves with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
