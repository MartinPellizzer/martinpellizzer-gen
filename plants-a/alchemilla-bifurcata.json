It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla bifurcata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
