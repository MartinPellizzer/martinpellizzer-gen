It features a rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Alchemilla glabra subsp. alpestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
