    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris lusus alpina, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate structure and preference for harsh environments, it is an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
