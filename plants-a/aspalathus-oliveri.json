    "intro": "Aspalathus oliveri, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well-adapted to the local climate. Its most valuable part is the reddish-brown tea made from its leaves, which is rich in antioxidants. Aspalathus oliveri plays an important role in both local ecosystems and the global tea industry."
