    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. calcitrapa, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, wind-swept conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. calcitrapa is primarily native to southern South America, including parts of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It is commonly found in temperate regions with a Mediterranean climate, particularly in coastal and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the variable environmental conditions of its native range. Its distribution is also influenced by its ability to tolerate both drought and frost.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. calcitrapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various habitats. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges. It spreads through its persistent, spiny burrs that cling to animals and clothing. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand."
