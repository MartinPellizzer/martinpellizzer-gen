    "intro": "Anthericum pratense, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments. Anthericum pratense is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
