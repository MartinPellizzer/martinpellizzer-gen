It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. Aglossorrhyncha bilobula is known for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
