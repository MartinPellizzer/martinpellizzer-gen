    "intro": "Astragalus macrotropis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus macrotropis var. robustus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
