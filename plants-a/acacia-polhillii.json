    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polhillii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats and savannas, often growing on hillsides and in areas with well-drained soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia polhillii is also sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polhillii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape region. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has been used in soil stabilization projects. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
