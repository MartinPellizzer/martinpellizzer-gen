    "intro": "Artemisia nilotica, commonly known as blue desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features silver-gray foliage with small, narrow leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia nilotica is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
