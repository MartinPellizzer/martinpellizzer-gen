It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its hairy stems and showy flowers. The subvariety 'intacta' differs from the main species by having more compact growth and less hairy foliage."
