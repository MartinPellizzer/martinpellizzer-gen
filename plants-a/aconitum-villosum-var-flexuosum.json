    "intro": "Aconitum villosum var. flexuosum, commonly known as the soft-hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a distinctive hooded shape typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant features soft, hairy foliage that is often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
