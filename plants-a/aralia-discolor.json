    "intro": "Aralia discolor, commonly known as the white angel's trumpets, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a white or pale greenish hue, contributing to its striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal color changes. Aralia discolor is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil."
