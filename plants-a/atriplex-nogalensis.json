    "intro": "Atriplex nogalensis, commonly known as the Nogal saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Atriplex nogalensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
