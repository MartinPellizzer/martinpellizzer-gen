    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. curvata, commonly known as curly bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that often curve outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Curly bentgrass is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of water bodies."
