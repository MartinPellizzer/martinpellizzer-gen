    "intro": "Aporostylis, commonly known as the spike-rush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Aporostylis species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, grassy leaves and small, clustered flowers. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. The genus includes over 50 species, many of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
