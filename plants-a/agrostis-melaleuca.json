    "intro": "Agrostis melaleuca, commonly known as coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Agrostis melaleuca plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
