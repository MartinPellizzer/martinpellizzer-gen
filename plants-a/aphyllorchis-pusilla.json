    "intro": "Aphyllorchis pusilla, commonly known as the small-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and possesses a single, short rhizome with a few pairs of elliptic leaves. The plant produces a single flower spike bearing a single, small, white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
