    "intro": "Adenophorus sarmentosus var. rockii, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its thin, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is typically found in rocky or disturbed habitats, often in mountainous regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.",
