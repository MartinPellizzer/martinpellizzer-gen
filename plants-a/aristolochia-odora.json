    "intro": "Aristolochia odora, commonly known as the sweet-scented Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive, aromatic fragrance. The plant produces dark green, heart-shaped leaves and has a rapid growth habit, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent, showy lip, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have historically been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to health risks."
