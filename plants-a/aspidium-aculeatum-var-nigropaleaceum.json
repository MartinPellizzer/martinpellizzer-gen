    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-pale fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing erect, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, glossy appearance on the upper surface and a darker, almost black, underside. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the pinnae. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices."
