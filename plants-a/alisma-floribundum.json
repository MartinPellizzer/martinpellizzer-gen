    "intro": "Alisma floribundum, commonly known as the showy water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces clusters of bright white or pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Alisma floribundum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
