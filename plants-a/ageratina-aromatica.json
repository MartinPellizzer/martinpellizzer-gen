    "intro": "Ageratina aromatica, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, blue-gray inflorescences that resemble mist, which appear in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Ageratina aromatica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
