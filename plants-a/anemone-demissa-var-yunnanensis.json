    "intro": "Anemone demissa var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a short, stout stem that often branches near the base, supporting clusters of delicate, cup-shaped blooms. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
