    "intro": "Astragalus geniculatus, commonly known as the bent-stem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted stem and small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus geniculatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats."
