    "intro": "Aristolochia conduplicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and striking, tubular flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure that resembles a pipe, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant of caution."
