    "intro": "Astragalus herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
