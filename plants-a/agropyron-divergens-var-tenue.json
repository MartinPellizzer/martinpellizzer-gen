    "intro": "Agropyron divergens var. tenue, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
