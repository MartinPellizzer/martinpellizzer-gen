    "intro": "Astragalus minutulus, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a small annual legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus minutulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
