    "intro": "Acetosella ornata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Acetosella ornata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
