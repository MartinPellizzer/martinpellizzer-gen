    "intro": "Athyrium frangulum, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
