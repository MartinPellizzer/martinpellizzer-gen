    "intro": "Arenaria olonensis, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor environments. Arenaria olonensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
