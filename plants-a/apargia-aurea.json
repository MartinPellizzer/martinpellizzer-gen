    "intro": "Apargia aurea, commonly known as golden twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Apargia aurea is notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. It is a non-showy plant, often overlooked but ecologically significant in its habitat."
