    "intro": "Allium minimum, commonly known as the Chinese leek or Chinese chives, is a hardy perennial plant native to East Asia. It features long, slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bulb-like structures that can be harvested. Allium minimum is often grown for its edible leaves and mild garlic-like flavor. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and culinary practices."
