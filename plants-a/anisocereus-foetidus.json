    "intro": "Anisocereus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
