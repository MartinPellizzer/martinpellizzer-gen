    "intro": "Allium cowanii, commonly known as Cowan's garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is part of the Allium genus, which includes many edible and ornamental species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Its bulbs are not typically consumed due to their strong flavor and potential toxicity."
