    "intro": "Anatherum portoricense, commonly known as the Portorican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
