    "intro": "Arenaria muscorum, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heaths and coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
