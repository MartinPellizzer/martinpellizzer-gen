    "intro": "Austrostipa rudis subsp. nervosa, commonly known as the nervy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often concealed within the foliage. Austrostipa rudis subsp. nervosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
