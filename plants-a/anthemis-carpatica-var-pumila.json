    "intro": "Anthemis carpatica var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features small, yellow flower heads surrounded by finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to its high content of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
