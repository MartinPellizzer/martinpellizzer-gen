    "intro": "Alismorkis curculigoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a water plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Alismorkis curculigoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
