    "intro": "Aphelandra arborescens, commonly known as the flame tree or torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright orange or red flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra arborescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
