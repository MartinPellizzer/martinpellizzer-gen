It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.
