    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. glabra, commonly known as smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are smooth to the touch in this variety. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
