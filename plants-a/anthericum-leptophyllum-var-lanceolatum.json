    "intro": "Anthericum leptophyllum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adder's tongue, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often glossy and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking, pale green to white spadices that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are arranged in a unique, elongated inflorescence. This plant prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in woodland or streamside environments."
