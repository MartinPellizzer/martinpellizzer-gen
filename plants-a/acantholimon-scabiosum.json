    "intro": "Acantholimon scabiosum, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon scabiosum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly found in rocky habitats, slopes, and coastal areas where the climate is dry and sunny. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in Mediterranean maquis and scrubland ecosystems. It is also present in some areas of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey and Israel. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon scabiosum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain environments. However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited impact on native ecosystems."
