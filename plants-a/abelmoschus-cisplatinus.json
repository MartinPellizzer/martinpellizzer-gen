    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cisplatinus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with high humidity. This species is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cisplatinus was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive and grow efficiently. This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical areas, often in agricultural settings where it is cultivated for its edible pods. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas. The introduction of Abelmoschus cisplatinus has been driven by its potential as a food crop and its adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant species."
