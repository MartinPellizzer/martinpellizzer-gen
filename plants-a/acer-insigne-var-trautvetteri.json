    "intro": "Acer insigne var. trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's maple, is a rare and striking variant of the acer insigne species. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage, which displays a striking contrast against its dark green leaves. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.",
