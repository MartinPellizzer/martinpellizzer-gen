It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive rose-pink hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
