    "intro": "Arenaria kansuensis var. acropetala, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and tundra-like environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh, arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
