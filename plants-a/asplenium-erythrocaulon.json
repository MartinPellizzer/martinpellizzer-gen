It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, reddish stems that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture.
