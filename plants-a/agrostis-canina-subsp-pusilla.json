    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. pusilla, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to frequent mowing. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
