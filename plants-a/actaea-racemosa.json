    "intro": "Actaea racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant produces dark red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Black cohosh is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade.",
