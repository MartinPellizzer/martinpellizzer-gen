    "intro": "Asplenium oceanicum, commonly known as the ocean holly, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils near the shore. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium oceanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
