    "intro": "Anthemis arvensis subsp. sphacelata, commonly known as field chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant grows in grassy areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic properties. The subspecies sphacelata is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Anthemis arvensis."
