    "intro": "Allium roseum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rose garlic, is a botanical variant of the common rose garlic. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with its bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are typically smaller than those of the standard Allium roseum. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like fragrance."
