    "intro": "Agropyron mongolicum var. villosum, commonly known as Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in groups, with awns present on the lemma and palea. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock in arid environments."
