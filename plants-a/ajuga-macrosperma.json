    "intro": "Ajuga macrosperma, commonly known as carpet bugle or broadleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ground-covering ability. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
