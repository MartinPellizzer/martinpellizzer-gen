    "intro": "Anetanthus gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It has a compact growth habit with stems that are usually less than 10 centimeters in height. Anetanthus gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
