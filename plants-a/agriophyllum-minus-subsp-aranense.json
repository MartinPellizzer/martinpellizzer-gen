    "intro": "Agriophyllum minus subsp. aranense, commonly known as the Armenian sandmat, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Caucasus. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. Its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
