It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its distinctive floral structure and its role as a spring-flowering plant in alpine ecosystems."
