    "intro": "Alocasia puteri, commonly known as the White Shield Alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and spathe. Alocasia puteri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
