It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.
