    "intro": "Anemonoides \u00d7 pittonii, commonly known as the hybrid anemone, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin, combining traits from both Anemone and Actaea species."
