It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
