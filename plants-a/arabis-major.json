    "intro": "Arabis major, commonly known as white rockcress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring. Arabis major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
