    "intro": "Aletes juncea, commonly known as common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous stem is valued for its strong, flexible fibers used in textile and paper production. Aletes juncea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
