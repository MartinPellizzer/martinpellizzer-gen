    "intro": "Andropogon pteropholis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in wet environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
