    "intro": "Aspidium ctenitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium ctenitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
