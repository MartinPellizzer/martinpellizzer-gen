    "intro": "Actaea podocarpa, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiogenic toxins that can cause severe illness if ingested. Despite its toxicity, Actaea podocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
