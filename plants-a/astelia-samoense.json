    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteleia samoense, commonly known as the Samoan aster, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the Asteliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
