    "intro": "Aureliana velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Aureliana velutina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
