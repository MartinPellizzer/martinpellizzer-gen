    "intro": "Aster umbrosus, commonly known as the shade aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade, making it well-suited for moist, rich soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aster umbrosus is valued in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and ability to attract pollinators."
