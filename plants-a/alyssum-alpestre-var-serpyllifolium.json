    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. serpyllifolium, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to bloom early in the growing season."
