It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
