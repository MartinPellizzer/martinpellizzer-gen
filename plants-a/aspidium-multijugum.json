    "intro": "Aspidium multijugum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bi-lobed fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Aspidium multijugum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
