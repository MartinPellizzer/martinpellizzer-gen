    "intro": "Adopogon virginicus var. hispidus, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicled cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with green or brown. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.",
