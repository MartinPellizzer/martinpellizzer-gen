    "intro": "Arachnothryx chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan spider tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and unique, spider-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
