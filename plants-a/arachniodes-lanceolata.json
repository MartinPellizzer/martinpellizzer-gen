    "intro": "Arachniodes lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf arachniodes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
