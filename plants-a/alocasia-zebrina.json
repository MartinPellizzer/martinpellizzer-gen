    "intro": "Alocasia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are adorned with distinctive white to cream-colored veins, creating a zebra-like pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with a broad, upright stem. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia zebrina is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant foliage and air-purifying properties."
