    "intro": "Agropyron desertorum var. muticum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important species for stabilizing desert landscapes. Its rhizomatous root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports biodiversity in its native habitat."
