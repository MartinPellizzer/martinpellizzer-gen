    "intro": "Aloe integra, commonly known as the Zulu aloe or rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, blooming in spring or early summer. Aloe integra thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
