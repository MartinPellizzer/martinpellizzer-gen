    "intro": "Aspidistra elatior subsp. elatior, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a shade-tolerant perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to humid environments and prefers well-draining, fertile soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
