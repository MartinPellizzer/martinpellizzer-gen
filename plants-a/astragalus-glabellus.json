    "intro": "Astragalus glabellus, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus glabellus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
