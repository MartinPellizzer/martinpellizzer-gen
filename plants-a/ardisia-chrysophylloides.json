    "intro": "Ardisia chrysophylloides, commonly known as the golden-leaf ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking golden-yellow during the flowering season. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural gardens and landscape design."
