The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, which can change with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
