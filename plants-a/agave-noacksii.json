    "intro": "Agave noacksii, commonly known as the Oaxaca agave, is a species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with small spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional practices and as an ornamental species."
