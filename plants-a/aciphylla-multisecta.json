    "intro": "Aciphylla multisecta, commonly known as the multi-sected silver grass, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and alpine regions. Aciphylla multisecta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",
