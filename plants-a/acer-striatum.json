    "intro": "Acer striatum, commonly known as the striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that often display a pale green stripe along the midrib. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 meters, with a slender, often twisted trunk. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras with two winged seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
