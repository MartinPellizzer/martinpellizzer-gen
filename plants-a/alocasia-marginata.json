It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking white veins, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Alocasia marginata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a statement plant in tropical landscapes."
