    "intro": "Acronia tipuloides, commonly known as the slender cranefly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Tipulidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and delicate wings, typical of many crane flies. The plant-like appearance of its larvae, which are often found in moist soils, has led to its common name. Acronia tipuloides plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Despite its name, it is not a plant but an insect, though its larvae may be mistaken for plant roots.",
