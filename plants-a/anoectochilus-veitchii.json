    "intro": "Anoectochilus veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich soil. It is often found in shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Anoectochilus veitchii is also noted for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
