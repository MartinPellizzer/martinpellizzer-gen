    "intro": "Ammannia coccinea subsp. robusta, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is notable for its deep, reddish color, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
