    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis proles prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate asparagus, is a low-growing variant of the common asparagus. It features slender, wiry stems that lie flat along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in garden settings. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
