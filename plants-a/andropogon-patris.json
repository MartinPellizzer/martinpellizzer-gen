    "intro": "Andropogon patris, commonly known as prairie grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often visible in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate periodic drought conditions. Andropogon patris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
