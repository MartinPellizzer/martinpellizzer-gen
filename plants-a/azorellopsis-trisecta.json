    "intro": "Azorellopsis trisecta, commonly known as the three-lobed azorellopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the Azores. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Azorellopsis trisecta is considered a species of conservation concern."
