    "intro": "Andinia ciliaris, commonly known as the threadleaf orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring. Its reproductive strategy involves insect pollination, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Andinia ciliaris is often found in association with other orchid species in its native habitat."
