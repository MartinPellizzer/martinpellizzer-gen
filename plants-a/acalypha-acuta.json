    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha acuta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Acalypha acuta is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha acuta was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. It has been reported to escape cultivation in some areas, leading to its naturalization in certain environments. However, its invasive potential varies depending on the region and local ecological conditions."
