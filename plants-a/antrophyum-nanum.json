    "intro": "Antrophyum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a compact cycad species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for outdoor cultivation in warm climates. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is often appreciated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant."
