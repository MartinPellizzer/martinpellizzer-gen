It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
