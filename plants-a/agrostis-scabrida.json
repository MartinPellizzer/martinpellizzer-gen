    "intro": "Agrostis scabrida, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis scabrida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
