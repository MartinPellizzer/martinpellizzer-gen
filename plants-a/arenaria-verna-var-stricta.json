    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. stricta, commonly known as spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered with small, bright green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other forms of Arenaria verna."
