    "intro": "Ammannia maritima, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid or salty conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Ammannia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
