It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble spikes, typically in shades of red or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium araliifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
