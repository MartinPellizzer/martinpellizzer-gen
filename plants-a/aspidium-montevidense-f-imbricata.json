It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely overlapping, imbricated pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
