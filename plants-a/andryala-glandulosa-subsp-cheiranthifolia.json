It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in open habitats like grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
