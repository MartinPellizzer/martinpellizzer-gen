    "intro": "Astragalus scottianus, commonly known as the Scottish milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
