    "intro": "Acantholimon tataricum, commonly known as Tatarian sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon tataricum is primarily native to Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon tataricum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. However, it is generally considered to have a low impact on native plant communities."
