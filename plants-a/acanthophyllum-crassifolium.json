    "intro": "Acanthophyllum crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved acanthophyllum, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall. Acanthophyllum crassifolium plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum crassifolium is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The species is commonly observed in desert and steppe habitats. Its distribution is closely associated with the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climate zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum crassifolium was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and low precipitation, typically in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments where competition from other plants is minimal, allowing it to establish and spread effectively. This plant is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites where it can take advantage of open spaces. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Australia. Due to its hardy nature, it can play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in these environments."
