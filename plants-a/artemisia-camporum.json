    "intro": "Artemisia camporum, commonly known as western goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has aromatic, silver-gray foliage due to its high concentration of volatile oils. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in dense, rounded heads. Artemisia camporum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
