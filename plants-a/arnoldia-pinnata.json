    "intro": "Arnoldia pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf arnoldia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, Arnoldia pinnata is often studied for its role in tropical ecosystems."
