    "intro": "Agrostis diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and roadside areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
