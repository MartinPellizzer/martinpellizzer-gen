    "intro": "Artemisia \u00d7 subsericea, commonly known as silver artemisia, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Artemisia \u00d7 subsericea is widely used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
