    "intro": "Aphragmus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its prickly stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its fruit is a globose capsule that contains numerous seeds. Aphragmus nepalensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
