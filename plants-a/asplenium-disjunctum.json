    "intro": "Asplenium disjunctum, commonly known as the fragmented spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium disjunctum is often found in montane and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
