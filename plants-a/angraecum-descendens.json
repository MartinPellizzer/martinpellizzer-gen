    "intro": "Angraecum descendens, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that can reach up to three meters in length, featuring intricate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure was famously predicted by Charles Darwin based on the morphology of its pollinating moth. Angraecum descendens is a symbol of evolutionary adaptation and has become a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
