    "intro": "Adenostemma ovatum, commonly known as the woolly leaf false morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Adenostemma ovatum is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage.",
