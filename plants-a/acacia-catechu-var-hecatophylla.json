    "intro": "Acacia catechu var. hecatophylla, commonly known as the Indian gum acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often feathery and composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark and sap are rich in tannins, making it valuable for traditional medicine and industrial uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia catechu var. hecatophylla is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. It thrives in dry, tropical, and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and savannas. This variant is particularly adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a significant role in local ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia catechu var. hecatophylla was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with moderate rainfall and sufficient sunlight. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is often used for its timber and as a source of tannins. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
