It belongs to the genus Calotropis and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a hairy, woody stem and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Agistron is known for its ability to thrive in arid and coastal environments due to its drought-resistant properties. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
