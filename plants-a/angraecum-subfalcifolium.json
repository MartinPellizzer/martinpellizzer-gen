    "intro": "Angraecum subfalcifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal moths, a relationship that highlights its adaptation to specific ecological conditions. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
