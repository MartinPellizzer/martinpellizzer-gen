It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or brown with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in shaded undergrowth. The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
