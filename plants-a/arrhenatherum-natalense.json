    "intro": "Arrhenatherum natalense, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Natal grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
