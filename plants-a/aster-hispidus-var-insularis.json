    "intro": "Aster hispidus var. insularis, commonly known as the insular aster, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, showing resilience to local climate variations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
