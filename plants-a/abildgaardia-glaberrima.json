    "intro": "Abildgaardia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaved abildgaardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia glaberrima is primarily native to the island of Sardinia, Italy. It is found in specific habitats within the island's coastal and mountainous regions. This plant is adapted to the unique climatic and geological conditions of Sardinia. It is a rare species with a limited geographic range. Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological zones of the island's interior and southern coasts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia glaberrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can outcompete native species. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
