    "intro": "Agrostis pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. Agrostis pittieri is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
