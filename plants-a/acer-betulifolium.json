    "intro": "Acer betulifolium, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the birch tree, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often at higher elevations. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by red or orange samaras. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer betulifolium is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is commonly found in California, Oregon, and Nevada, as well as in Baja California. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and open woodlands. It is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. Its distribution is largely limited to the Pacific coast region of North America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer betulifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in open woodlands, stream banks, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It has a spreading habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range."
