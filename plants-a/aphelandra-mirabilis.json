    "intro": "Aphelandra mirabilis, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, golden-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra mirabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage and unique appearance."
