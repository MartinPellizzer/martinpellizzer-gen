    "intro": "Apium \u00d7 moorei, commonly known as the giant parsley, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Apium graveolens (common parsley) and Apium bereta (celery). It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often cultivated for its aromatic foliage and is used in culinary applications similar to parsley and celery. However, it is less commonly grown than its parent species due to its vigorous growth and potential for becoming invasive."
