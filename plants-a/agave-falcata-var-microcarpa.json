    "intro": "Agave falcata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf agave or small-fruited agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by fleshy, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
