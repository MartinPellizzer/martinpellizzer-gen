It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in association with water. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Astianthus viminalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
