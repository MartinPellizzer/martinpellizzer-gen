    "intro": "Arbutus peninsularis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, bright red berries that are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. Arbutus peninsularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
