It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to dry environments, featuring deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
