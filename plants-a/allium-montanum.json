    "intro": "Allium montanum, commonly known as mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a strong, pungent odor similar to garlic, due to its sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Allium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
