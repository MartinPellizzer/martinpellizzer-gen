It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in shades of purple and white. Aster pyrenaicus plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude flora."
