    "intro": "Asplenium ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices within mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
