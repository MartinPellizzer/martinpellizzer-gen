    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf rockgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to rocky and mountainous regions. It features narrow, flat leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in rocky or sandy soils."
