It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is tolerant of cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
