    "intro": "Aechmea meeana, commonly known as the Mexican pineapple or the velvet bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.
