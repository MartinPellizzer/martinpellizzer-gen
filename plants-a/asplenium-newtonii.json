    "intro": "Asplenium newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are typically clustered in linear rows. Asplenium newtonii is a relatively hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
