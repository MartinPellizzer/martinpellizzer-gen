    "intro": "Achnatherum wallowaense, commonly known as the Walloway needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural environment. Achnatherum wallowaense plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
