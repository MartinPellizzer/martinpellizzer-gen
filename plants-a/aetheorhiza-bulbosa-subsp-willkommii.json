    "intro": "Aetheorhiza bulbosa subsp. willkommii, commonly known as the Willkommi's bulbous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bulbous root system and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and limited soil nutrients. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter stems compared to the typical form of Aetheorhiza bulbosa."
