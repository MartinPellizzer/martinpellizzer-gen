    "intro": "Astragalus tekabensis, commonly known as Tekab milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and can be found in rocky and semi-arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
