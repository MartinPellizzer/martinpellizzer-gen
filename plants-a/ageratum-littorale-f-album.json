    "intro": "Ageratum littorale f. album, commonly known as the white coastal ageratum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fluffy, white flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils, thriving in coastal environments where it is exposed to salt spray. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, pale green leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal habitats."
