    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus f. lachleri, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention and protection against harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
