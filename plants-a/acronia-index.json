    "intro": "Acronia index, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces dark, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. It thrives in coastal areas with sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species.",
