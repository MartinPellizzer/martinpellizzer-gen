    "intro": "Azolla pinnata var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating fronds, which are divided into small, oval-shaped leaves. This plant is often found in slow-moving or still water bodies, such as ponds and rice fields. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective bioindicator of nutrient-rich waters. The plant's unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria is one of its key botanical features."
