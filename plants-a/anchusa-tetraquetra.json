It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky areas.
