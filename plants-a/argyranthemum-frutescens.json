It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white or pink flowers. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in full sun. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Argyranthemum frutescens is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
