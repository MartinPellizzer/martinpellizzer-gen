    "intro": "Apterantha, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often pale-colored flowers that appear to float above the foliage, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plants are native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Carolinas. Apterantha species typically grow in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The genus includes several species, such as *Apterantha calyculata*, which is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
