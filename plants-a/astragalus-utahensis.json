    "intro": "Astragalus utahensis, commonly known as Utah milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Utah and neighboring states. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
