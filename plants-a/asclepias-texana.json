    "intro": "Asclepias texana, commonly known as Texas milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Texas milkweed plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
