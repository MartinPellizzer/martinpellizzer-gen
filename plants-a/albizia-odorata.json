It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Albizia odorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for reforestation and soil stabilization projects."
