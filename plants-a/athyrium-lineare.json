    "intro": "Athyrium lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually 30 to 60 centimeters long. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Athyrium lineare thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
