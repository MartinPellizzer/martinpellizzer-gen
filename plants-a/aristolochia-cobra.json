    "intro": "Aristolochia cobra, commonly known as the cobra lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a cobra's head, which is a key feature in its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its vines can grow quite long, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acids in its tissues."
