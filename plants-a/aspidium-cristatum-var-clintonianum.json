    "intro": "Aspidium cristatum var. clintonianum, commonly known as the Clinton's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
