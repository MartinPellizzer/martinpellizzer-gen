    "intro": "Angraecum eburneum var. brongniartianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and pendulous, white to pale lavender flowers with a distinctive star-like shape. The plant is characterized by its hairy, leathery leaves and is adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of tropical forests. It produces fragrant blooms that are typically nocturnal, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
