It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, fuzzy fruits that ripen to a yellowish-orange color. Its fruit is edible, with a creamy, custard-like texture and a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
