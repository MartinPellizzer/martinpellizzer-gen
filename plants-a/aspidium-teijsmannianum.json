    "intro": "Aspidium teijsmannianum, commonly known as the Teijsmann's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
