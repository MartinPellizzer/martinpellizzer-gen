It features a distinctive, cascading growth habit with long, slender branches that droop gracefully from the main stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
