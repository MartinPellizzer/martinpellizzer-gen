    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grisebachiana is primarily native to Trinidad and Tobago. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and lowland areas of these islands. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments with ample sunlight. It is often seen growing in disturbed soils near human settlements. Its native distribution is limited to the Caribbean region, specifically Trinidad and Tobago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grisebachiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and gardeners. The plant has since naturalized in certain areas, becoming part of the local flora in some regions. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
