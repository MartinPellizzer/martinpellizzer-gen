    "intro": "Astragalus salvatoris, commonly known as the Salvator's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus salvatoris is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
