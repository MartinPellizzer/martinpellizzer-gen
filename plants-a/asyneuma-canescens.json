    "intro": "Asyneuma canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Asyneuma canescens is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of deserts and in grasslands."
