    "intro": "Asterocephalus rigida, commonly known as the rigid-headed aster, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Asterocephalus rigida is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun."
