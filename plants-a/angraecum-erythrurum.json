    "intro": "Angraecum erythrurum, commonly known as the red-flowered star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, deep red petals and sepals that form a star-like shape, making it visually distinctive. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as hawkmoths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Angraecum erythrurum is known for its long nectar spur, which is adapted to the feeding habits of its pollinators."
