    "intro": "Astragalus lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. This perennial plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
