    "intro": "Astragalus miser var. praeteritus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils in arid environments."
