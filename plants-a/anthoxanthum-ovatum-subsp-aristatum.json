    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum subsp. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
