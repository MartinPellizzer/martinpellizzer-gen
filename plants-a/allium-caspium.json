    "intro": "Allium caspium, commonly known as the Caspian garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has a strong garlic scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its bulbs are edible and can be used similarly to garlic in cooking. Allium caspium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
