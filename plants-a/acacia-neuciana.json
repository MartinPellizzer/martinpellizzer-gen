    "intro": "Acacia neuciana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow to pale yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Acacia neuciana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia neuciana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed sites. It is often associated with dry to semi-dry climates and can tolerate seasonal droughts. Acacia neuciana plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia neuciana was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide shade in degraded lands. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in poor soils. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful but sometimes problematic species."
