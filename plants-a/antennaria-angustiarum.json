    "intro": "Antennaria angustiarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Antennaria angustiarum is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes."
