    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatum var. orarium, commonly known as the wall fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and glossy. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it cling to vertical surfaces. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is frequently cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
