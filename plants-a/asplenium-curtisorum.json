    "intro": "Asplenium curtisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive frond structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, characteristic of many fern species. Asplenium curtisorum is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of microhabitats, making it a common sight in forested areas."
