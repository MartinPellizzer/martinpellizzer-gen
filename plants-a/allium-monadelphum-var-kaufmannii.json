    "intro": "Allium monadelphum var. kaufmannii, commonly known as the Kaufmann's onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
