    "intro": "Aspidium glochidiatum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are often covered in small, spiny structures called glochidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium glochidiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
