    "intro": "Agrostis musjidii, commonly known as the Musjid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis musjidii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
