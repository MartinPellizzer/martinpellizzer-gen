    "intro": "Amphineuron, commonly known as the swamp holly, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in swampy areas. Amphineuron is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
