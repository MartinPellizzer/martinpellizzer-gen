    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 semivulparia, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a cross between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum vulparia, resulting in a plant with distinctive hood-shaped flowers. The plant features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and thrives in moist, shady woodland areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
