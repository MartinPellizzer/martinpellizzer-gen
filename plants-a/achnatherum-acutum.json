    "intro": "Achnatherum acutum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in poor soils. Achnatherum acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.",
