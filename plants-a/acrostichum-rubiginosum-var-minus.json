    "intro": "Acrostichum rubiginosum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser red fern, is a variant of the red fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered in a reddish or rusty bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms.",
