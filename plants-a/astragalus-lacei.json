    "intro": "Astragalus lacei, commonly known as the lacey milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus lacei is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
