    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoutriger, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. Astragalus pseudoutriger plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators with its nectar-rich blooms."
