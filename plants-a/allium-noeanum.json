It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers on tall, slender stems. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, sulfur-containing compounds that contribute to its distinctive garlic-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium noeanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses in traditional cuisines."
