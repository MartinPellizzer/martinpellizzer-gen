    "intro": "Aconitum artemisiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and palmately compound leaves that resemble those of the Artemisia genus. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with care.",
