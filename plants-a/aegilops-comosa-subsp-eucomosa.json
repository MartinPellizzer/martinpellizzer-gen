    "intro": "Aegilops comosa subsp. eucomosa, commonly known as the hairy wild barley, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a tough, protective pericarp. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity in wheat-related crops."
