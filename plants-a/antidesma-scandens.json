It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and used in traditional medicine."
