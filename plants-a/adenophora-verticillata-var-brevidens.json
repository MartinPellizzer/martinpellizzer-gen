    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata var. brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of eastern North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Adenophora verticillata.",
