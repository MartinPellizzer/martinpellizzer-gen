    "intro": "Alopecurus heleochloides, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
