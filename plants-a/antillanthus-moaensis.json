It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
