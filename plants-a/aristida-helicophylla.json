    "intro": "Aristida helicophylla, commonly known as the spiralgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that give it a distinctive spiral appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Aristida helicophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
