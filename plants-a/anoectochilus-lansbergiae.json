    "intro": "Anoectochilus lansbergiae, commonly known as the Malayan toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive toothed lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it is often found in rocky or mossy areas. Anoectochilus lansbergiae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
