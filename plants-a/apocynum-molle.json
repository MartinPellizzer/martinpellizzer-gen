    "intro": "Apocynum molle, commonly known as woolly dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
