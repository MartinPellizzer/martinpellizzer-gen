    "intro": "Antennaria tomentella, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Antennaria tomentella is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
