    "intro": "Athyrium latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, broadly pinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into numerous narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through rhizome growth."
