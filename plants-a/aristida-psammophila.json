    "intro": "Aristida psammophila, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, exhibiting a deep root system for water absorption. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems. Due to its hardiness, it is also used in restoration projects to prevent erosion in disturbed areas."
