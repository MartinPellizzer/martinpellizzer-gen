It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
