This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon erythraeum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. The plant is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its distribution is largely limited to the northern and central parts of New Zealand."
