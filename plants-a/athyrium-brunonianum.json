    "intro": "Athyrium brunonianum, commonly known as the Brunonian shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
