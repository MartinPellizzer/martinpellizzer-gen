    "intro": "Alsophila corcovadensis, commonly known as the corcovado fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket weaving by indigenous communities."
