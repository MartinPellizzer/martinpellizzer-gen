    "intro": "Agrostis distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
