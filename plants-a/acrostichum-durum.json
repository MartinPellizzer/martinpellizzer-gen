    "intro": "Acrostichum durum, commonly known as the hardy brake fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.",
