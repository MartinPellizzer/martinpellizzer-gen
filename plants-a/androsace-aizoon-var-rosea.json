    "intro": "Androsace aizoon var. rosea, commonly known as the pink rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle rose hue. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
