    "intro": "Athyrium dolichosorum, commonly known as the long-veined maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with long, slender pinnae that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Athyrium dolichosorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
