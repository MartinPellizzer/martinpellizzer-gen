The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, with a distinct labellum that is reduced or absent. Asarca nudilabia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and pollination biology."
