    "intro": "Arctium eriobasis, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial plant that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped basal leaves and purple-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by clinging to animal fur. Its root is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a source of food for insects and a habitat for various small animals. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
