    "intro": "Ascolabium pusillum, commonly known as the small acorn lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark yellow, with a finely granular surface. It lacks distinct apothecia but has a well-developed medulla. This lichen is often found in shaded, humid environments and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
