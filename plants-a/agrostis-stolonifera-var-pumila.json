    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. pumila, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in height, contributing to its dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its compact growth habit, it is frequently used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
