    "intro": "Arenaria parvifolia var. schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
