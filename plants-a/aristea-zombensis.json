    "intro": "Aristea zombensis, commonly known as the zombie grass, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Due to its unusual appearance and the mythological associations with its name, it has become a subject of interest in both botanical and cultural studies."
