    "intro": "Aspidium pseudofilix-mas, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in humid conditions."
