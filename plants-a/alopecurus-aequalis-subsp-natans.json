    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis subsp. natans, commonly known as floating grass, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its buoyant, floating leaves that allow it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a slender stem with whorled leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in loose clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn. This species is often found in ponds, lakes, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
