    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. leuca, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common green-winged orchid. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast sharply with the dark green foliage. This orchid is a perennial herb that typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of elongated, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in areas with calcareous soils."
