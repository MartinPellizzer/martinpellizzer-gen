    "intro": "Acer sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate gardens.",
