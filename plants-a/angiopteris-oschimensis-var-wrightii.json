    "intro": "Angiopteris oschimensis var. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
