    "intro": "Abelia, commonly known as weeping abelia, is a genus of flowering plants in the honeysuckle family. These shrubs are native to eastern Asia and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Abelia plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value, featuring clusters of pink, white, or red blooms. They thrive in partial shade to full sun and are relatively low maintenance, making them popular in garden settings."
