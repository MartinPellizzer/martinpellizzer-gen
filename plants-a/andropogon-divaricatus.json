    "intro": "Andropogon divaricatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Switchgrass is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun. It is often used in restoration ecology and as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements."
