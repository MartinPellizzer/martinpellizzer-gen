    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha goetzei is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where it can access abundant water. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its native distribution is closely tied to its preference for moist, nutrient-rich soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha goetzei was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often aided by human activity and wind. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in various habitats, sometimes becoming invasive. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
