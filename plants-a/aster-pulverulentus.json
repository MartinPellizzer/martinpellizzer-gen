    "intro": "Aster pulverulentus, commonly known as the dust aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, and it thrives in full sun. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are finely divided and covered in a powdery coating, giving the plant its common name."
