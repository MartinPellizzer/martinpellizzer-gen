    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. longana, commonly known as the long-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender, upright stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and its resemblance to the alchemical symbols of transformation."
