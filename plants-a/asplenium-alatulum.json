    "intro": "Asplenium alatulum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Asplenium alatulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
