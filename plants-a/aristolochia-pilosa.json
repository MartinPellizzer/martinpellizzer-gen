    "intro": "Aristolochia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy pipevine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often violet or greenish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal, despite its medicinal risks."
