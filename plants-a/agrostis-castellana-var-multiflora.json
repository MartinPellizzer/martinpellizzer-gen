It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine environments. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for invertebrates in high-altitude ecosystems."
