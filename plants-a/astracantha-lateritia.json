    "intro": "Astracantha lateritia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Astracantha lateritia is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native range."
