    "intro": "Astragalus tenuifolius var. austro-oranensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
