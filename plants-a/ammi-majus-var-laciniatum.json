    "intro": "Ammi majus var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
