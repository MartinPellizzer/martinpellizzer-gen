    "intro": "Agrostis coarctata var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock and wildlife in high-altitude environments."
