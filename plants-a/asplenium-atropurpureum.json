    "intro": "Asplenium atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that often display a purplish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Asplenium atropurpureum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
