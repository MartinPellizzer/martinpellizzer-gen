    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. nurub, commonly known as the rough wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown glumes and lemma-like bracts. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated barley and its potential for agricultural improvement."
